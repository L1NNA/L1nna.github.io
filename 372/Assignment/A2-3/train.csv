8594,1,Delivers what it promises_This disposable razor does exactly what it promises: delivers a close shave with a smooth finish and no irritation. No complaints here.
2202,1,Top Coat_The best top coat I have ever used. It drys supper fast and makes your manicure look shiny and bright!
5977,1,"Effortless No Heat Curls_You need to start out with dry hair. If your hair is too damp it won't ever get dry. Spritz the ends of your hair with some water once or twice, not very much. You could add some product but it isn't necessary. Leave in conditioner, shine anti-frizz serum, gel or mousse. Whatever you normally use. Take a small pea sized amount in your hand and run it through your hair.You can create curls two different ways. You can take a 1-2 inch section of hair, twist the hair and wind it around the width of the roller, then bend the ends of the roller in to secure it. Another way to use them is to place the roller at the ends of your hair. Wrap the ends around the roller to get it started then roll it up. If you have layers make sure to check for loose bits of hair and wrap those back in. Then bend the ends of the roller to secure it.Wrapping your hair with a scarf or a satin sleep cap will help keep your rollers in place while you sleep. When you wake up in the morning to take them out you'll have perfect curls that last all day. The best part about these rollers, besides being incredibly easy to use and get curls, is that you aren't damaging your hair.I've tried other rollers that had to be secured with pins or clips. They were heavy and hurt my scalp, and unwrapping my hair resulted in a massive knot. Hot tools never really gave me the desired results I wanted. There was always some strand of hair I missed or one curl was tighter than the other. I don't have any of those problems with foam rollers. It takes all the guess work out and gives you healthy curly hair."
2065,1,"Silky_Great as a skin smoother. My skin has been so much silkier after using this product. The downside is that it is not effective at removing makeup or deep cleaning the skin. I recommend using a makeup remover, then a deep cleanser, and if you want the smoothing effect use this Cetaphil last."
868,1,"If it's good enough for Giada, it's good enough for me!_The perfect nude/neutral color.  Be prepared for plenty of complements on your clean, beautiful nails.  I have lots of nail polish (more bottles than I care to admit), and this is one of the two that I have actually finished the whole bottle of-which really tells how attractive it is, and what a great neutral it is."
1749,1,"Did you Know...?_Did you know the Earth Therapeutics foam applicators fit AND their micro-exfoliation cream works well with this device?Foam Applicators- Dual Replenishment PackGreen Tea Cellular Renewal Micro-Exfoliation CreamThey do I use them and the results are great!I have one of these, love it but refuse to buy the ridiculously priced discontinued refills. I've been finding ways to get more life out of the device since the line has been discontinued and replacements/refills are scarce.UPDATE: 9/7/2011Neutrogena recently started selling aNeutrogena Microdermabrasion Systemthat's a newer version of this item for TWENTY BUCKS or less ANDNeutrogena System Refill Puffs - 24 Countfor EIGHTEEN BUCKS or less! The best thing is the new pads fit this Rejuvenator, older Microdermabrasion Systems and the Wave systems too!!!"
287,1,Use small amounts please_Control yourselves. I know most of us have scaly and dry hands from the weather and certain occupational hazards but only a little will do you right. Palms are no longer itchy and looking like a crusty tomato.I can no longer use my hands as sandpaper but hey now I can touch my face without peeling it off. Great product! I no longer have sand paper for hands!
66,1,"very GOOD product!_i love this product, when i first read the comments from other costumers i thought &#34;OK i'll go with it and try what will be the results&#34; & oh i must say i was amazed, when i have something on my face that disturbs i put it and thats all its Gone :))). i do i either in the evening or morning  ..."
3718,1,"GOOD_Cheap, nice color, isn't sticky, goes with everything... What more can you ask?"
1343,1,"was just what i ordered_love this type or orange wood sticks. no used to the ones that have a sharp point on one end and flat on the order. use it when polished nails, pushing back cuticles or when doing nail art."
3352,1,Smells fresh and clean not overly strong._I love this items fresh and clean smelling. I love that it isn't too strong either. It works for me and I would buy it again.
5175,0,"Worst Foundation_This is the worst foundation I've ever bought.  It is supposed go on 'like a liquid and finish like a powder'.  It takes several applications to get a good enough coverage bc it does not go on smoothly.  I had better luck wetting the sponge a little but even then, the coverage is not what I like in a foundation.  It seems more like a powder then a foundation.I would not recomend this foundation to anyone."
7342,1,"Olay Age Defying Day Cream and Serum_This product is wonderful.  Keeps skin moist all day.Very light and just need to use a dab.  Good smell, but very light.Really makes a difference.  Use with the Night cream and youwill see noticeable results FAST.  Will buy again !"
8304,1,"Superb effects, and for an amazingly inexpensive price_I don't know what I did or didn't do to my hair over the recent holidays, but it looked AWFUL this morning when I woke up.I was at that 'Ah,PLEASE don't look at me OR my hair' phase.I must have had a restless night without realizing it. Or something. Maybe I went sleepwalking in the mind of Charles Dickens as he wrote the depressing part of 'A Christmas Carol' and had I bad hair because of that. I cannot explain it. It was, in a word, weird.Frankly, my unrealized restless nights are the WORST for incubating and ultimately bringing forth potential BAD HAIR days.So this morning, I basically looked like a character in Alien VS Predator when I woke up.Fortuitously, my Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Morroccan Styling Oil was right next to my side of the bed, waiting to be reviewed.I grabbed it before I even had my cup of coffee, and here is how it scores:1) ease of opening when half asleep and your fingers don't work but you MUST open it because you look like a nightmare: A+2) ease of applying when you can barely read the instructions: A+3) ease of relaxing and styling your pathetically snarled up hair from your restless night, just using the handy pump, putting some on your palms and rubbing it through your hair with your fingers: A+4) shine effect on dulled out hair: A+5) general feeling of well being about yourself and that you can GO on LIVING without being banished to a desert island all by yourself because you used to look horrible: A+Conclusion: I love this wonderful Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Morroccan Styling Oil because it works wonders! I have become a a phoenix, risen from the ashes of 'ugly hair' (one of the most reviled and shameful qualities I can have, to my mind).Plus, it smells fine and not too strong.PLUS--the big plus--it's a quality product at a very inexpensive price.How can you go wrong with this?You can't.So don't be banished to a desert island: get this terriific product!!!"
4298,1,"WOW! DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS, BUT IT DOES_I am on a restricted calorie diet, so I have been losing some hair (don't worry, it will grow back).  So my hair is really, really thin and flat. This was delivered this morning, pre-shower time.  Used a little blow dry gel and round brush as usual to dry my hair. Then sprinkled a tiny amount on the top of my head, and did some finger fluffing. Instantly, my hair was about twice as high.  I love this stuff. My hair feels like I used a little texturing wax on it, but it looks great, and is not at all stiff like hair spray.  Have been out and about all day, and have done a couple of fluffs, and it is still great. I am going to be using this every day."
5980,1,"Smells great, does a great job at cleaning hair!_For referene, I am latina, with dry frizzy hair and an oily scalp with flakiness. First of all, I love the way this shampoo smells. I love that it cleans my hair and leaves it flake free, without drying it. What more can you ask? This is one of my favorite shampoos!"
7332,0,Would have loved to try this BUT NOT PARABEN-FREE like the shampoo_Too bad it is not paraben free like the it's a 10 volumizing shampoo.Would have loved to try this but not with Methylparaben!Purchased Alteran instead which is PARABEN-FREE
8773,1,"Quite good_The Dove Color Care Daily conditioner is a treat to use. It has a sweet clean scent that is very pleasant but not overwhelming. The conditioner is thick and luscious. It spreads easily through the hair. I let it sit for a few minutes and then rinse. It rinses out nicely but leaves smooth tangle free hair.When I air dried my hair, the conditioner did a great job on it's own. My hair was smooth and had a nice lush feeling to it. I felt like it left my hair as shiny as any other conditioner has.However, when I did a blowout, my hair had flyaways. I did need some additional serum to keep it sleek and smooth.Overall this is a fantastic conditioner at a very nice price."
6805,1,"Does What It Says..._I saw this product demonstrated on QVC and was skeptical.  The guest made it sound so convincing and the model demonstration too that I had to give it a try.  I have good skin, very little sagging and no lines but too many years in the Southern California sun has resulted in brown spots and uneven texture.  As a result I was always searching for that perfect foundation to hide everything but at the same time let my natural skin shine through.  Needless to say it doesn't exist when you're 55+ years old. So Phliosopy's motto is 'makeup optional skin'.  That's what I was looking for.  I ordered it on QVC however found it much cheaper here.  THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING!!!  After the first two times of trying this I started seeing that youthful pink glow and fine, moist texture I remember I had,,,perhaps even better!  Immediately I saw glowing sking and the brown spots fading away...no lines, and my skin perhaps even tightening and firming.  I WON'T BE WITHOUT THIS ONE PRODUCT!!!  The moisturizer 'Miracle Worker' is also correctly named.  I'm not a big fan of moisturizer and that this one looked 'heavy', but it quickly dissapates into your skin and leaves it ready for makeup or not."
8891,1,Love the smell_I use this on So California dry weather days.  LOVE the smell.  Also use the Replenishing Treatment w/ the same scent.  Only 4 stars since I wish it was a larger size.  Love the price of this seller.
4702,1,LOVE_Can't tell you how much this stuff works...you have to try it for yourself to believe it. I bought a set of 5 so I could give one to each of my younger cousins who are now in the age of dealing with acne. I can't wait to have them try it!I use it one or two times a day Morning and Night but first I wash my face then I put on a cheap generic lotion with salasylic acid (forgive an spelling errors on that) Then I dab on the proactive mask and rub on over the areas with the worst acne. This process has worked for me and during my more 'time of the month' episodes then I up it to twice a day and if I use the lotion as stated my face doesn't dry out! I also will use it on acne and then put make-up on after the mask is on first which helps stop acne from worsening if needed...but I prefere to not wear foundation all the time.
3578,1,Nice rose water_The gentle rose water fragrance is very appealing. I use it before putting on moisturiazer. It makes my skin feels really soft.
6037,1,"murad skin  cream_I like it ,,,,But this is more  like a sun screen not a face moisturizer..They  were not clear about this,I do use it and will keep it. It leaves my skin and glowy.."
6825,1,"Excellent quality, Beautiful Red_Not much to say besides this is GREAT gel nail polish. The red is beautiful- not too orange, not too blue. It works well, dries nicely and lasts."
7656,0,not the same as the picture &#128133;_Just came today not the same colors as the picture but I guess that's fine I got 4 different green and 2 purple pretty much the same looking colors can't really good tell them apart except the blue white and pink everything else looks pretty much the same but it is glitter dust.
2144,1,"maybelline new york ultra-brow brown powder_If you want your eyebrows to look drawn in, use a pencil! but if you want a softnatural look, use this Maybelline brow powder with brush. It is easy to use and stays on.  I could only give 4 stars because the plastic case soon comes apart at the hinges and is troublesome to fasten on again."
866,0,"Probably not safe_I think that you might be better off using regular hair dye. This stuff has a lead warning on the side of the bottle and after throwing caution to the wind I used it. Terrible stuff. I noticed that while it does darken your hair, it also damaged it too. Stay away from this product and just use the hair dye or embrace the gray."
3324,1,Cool Little Concealer_I usually hunt for a concealer that actually conceals for my skin tone. So after some youtube stalking trying to find a chick that matched my complexion I was showed this little gem. If you use Mac N45 or Mac studio fix C6 you might wanna throw this in your makeup bag as a reasonable backup.
3794,1,"Very Good_I use this every day it really does the job, my daughter used it and wants some for her self. I will be buying more. Yes, I would recommend."
4881,1,"came in glass container_I couldn't wait to open it up, it was a bubble wrapped and came in an amazon box. The product itself sits in a glass bottle and to me only great products come in glass bottle. I sprayed a little on my neck, the smell wasn't that impressive and since I just used it once I don't know how well it'll work yet. I just thought Id mention about the glass container."
5767,1,"Nice_It really impressed me, because I wasn't going to buy this one, I was going to by a 23 dolars Sigma duofiber brush. I was relutant, but I had to buy this one because of the price. And I have to say it impressed me. It is more soft than I was expecting and it feels good in touch with the skin, it doesn't scratches it."
8018,1,Does what it says it does_The following review is based on my wife's use of the product:I've been using this product for a couple weeks and love it. It goes on very smoothly and evenly with no clumps at all. My lashes are evenly coated and clearly separated every time. It stays on all day but comes off cleanly with my makeup remover. I was sent brown instead of my usual color black. I was impressed by the way the brown looked. Dark enough for my taste but still clearly brown. My only criticism is minor- the handle is wider than most other mascara's. It makes it feel a bit awkward in my small hand but ultimately I think it helps me apply the mascara better.
5926,1,"AMAZING_I've heard about Argan oil for a long time and finally decided to try it, and I love it. I like the pump, which works so much better... and I since I've gotten it, I've used it on my hair, which makes it nice and shinny and soft and on my face. I have never thought to put oil on my face which is prone to breakouts, but it works so well, and has actually cleared it up and softened my wrinkles. I am in my mid thirties and this has helped make me look so much younger and have gotten many compliments. I already stay out of the sun and take care of my skin and already everyone thinks I'm in my 20's but this product made me look and feel so much younger than before. I will use this for the rest of my life. I just mix a few pumps with my daily moisturizer Olay for sensitive skin, on my face and neck and it works wonders. My skin is glowing."
8562,1,"Good travel brush kit._WARNING: These are very short handled travel sized brushes. So, if you are looking for a set of long handled, full sized brushes, this is not the set for you.  However, even though they are small and travel-sized, they are amazing. The brush heads are full and soft, apply your cream, liquid & powder cosmetics easily and evenly, and clean up nicely, while retaining their shapes.  Also, the bonus is that the packaging they come in is actually a small hardcover &#34;book&#34; storage case, which makes this very handy for traveling.  The usage guide inside the inner cover is also very handy for beginners or for anyone who wants to know which brushes were designed to do what (though one can use the brushes for cosmetics outside of the recommendations on the box without any ill effect, as I have).  A very thoughtful stocking stuffer for a makeup person. I know I keep mine in my purse and use it regularly."
1233,1,"Totally sleek._This is my all time favorite shampoo and conditioner. It smells good, but not from chemical perfume. I've been buying it at Amazon for ages, because it is a great price here. I often use it on my Maltese who has hair to the floor, and it is excellent for her too."
4267,1,it's makeup_do you like mineral makeup? Then you will like this--same thing you can get at Sephora or ULTA only without the driving or dealing with stuck up sales people
2339,0,"Loved it at first_***UpdateIf I could give it zero stars, I would.  Wen over-conditions my hair.  It won't curl.  It just hangs there.  Believe me, I have never had that experience before.  I'm giving it to a friend with very, very long hair and advising her to use it as a conditioner, and to keep it away from her scalp.***UpdateDown to one star.  I honestly have to say that this is the worst shampoo that I've ever used.  After a few hours, my hair is oily.  I've never had a problem with oily hair before.  So, I tried using it as a conditioner, after washing with a sulfate-free shampoo.  I also made sure that I didn't get any on my scalp.  Less 8 hours later, limp hair that wouldn't hold a curl.  I tried this several times, with the same result.  Now, I'm using it as a conditioner, just for the very ends of my hair.  I use a very small amount, rub it between my hands, and smooth over the surface of my hair, immediately rinsing it out.  This way works for me, but $50 is a bit much.***UpdateDown to three stars.  Well, I like it even less now.  I used only about half of what I used on my first try.  I did not get the Wen anywhere near my front scalp line.12 hours later, my hair is greasy, oily, lank, limp.  Yuk!  I haven't given up, yet.---------------------Originally rated four stars.  When I received the Wen shampoo, I was so excited.  I couldn't wait to try it.First of all, I have very thick shoulder length hair, with a lot of wave, that I can easily turn to spiky curls by scrunching it.  It does get a little frizzy, but that is very manageable with a very small bit of coconut oil applied only to the surface.When my hair dried, it was so light, almost fluffy, but not like cotton candy.  It had a lot more wave than with other shampoos.  It was bouncy, clean.; I loved it.Less than 24 hours later, it was oily, heavy, drab.  My bangs were a greasy mess.  Not so loving it anymore.Also, I used about half the amount indicated for my hair.  Even though my hair is very thick, the amount suggested would definitely have been overkill.I'm going to try it again, using about half of what I used the first time.  I'm sure that will be plenty."
5993,1,Clarisonic_Product works great!  After about 2-3 weeks I started to get compliments from everybody!  I love it!  It is worth the money spent!
3379,0,Not worthy the money I paid for it_I never could get the polish remover into the pen; a Qtip dipped in polish remover works just as well!
1048,0,"Did not produce the color advertised._It lightened the hair VERY slightly, I'm not sure how noticeable it was. I would not recommend it unless you want a very slight change."
7008,1,Edges Controlled_my baby hair is hard to stay down. it needs extra extra extra holding gel to stay down and I would rather not use that. this works wonders
9579,1,"Excellent Everyday Carry but not TSA-friendly_This is a compact (2 4/8&#34; L x 3/4&#34; W x 1/2&#34; D not including key ring), lightweight (only 5.25 oz) keychain compatible multi-tool plus nail clipper is perfect for your Every Day Carry (EDC).  It has an impressively sharp compact nail clipper, a mini blade, a nail file, a pair of mini micro-serrated scissors and of course the key ring.  All of this is surrounded with &#34;Swiss Army Red&#34; casing which helps it stand out in the depths of a dark bag.  The one surprise is that while this carries the Zwilling Logo, it is not made in Germany but in South Korea.  However, it is still very sharp and seems as well made as my older made-in-Germany Zwilling implements.  I will report back as to the longevity of this item.Perfect as an Every Day Carry item for yourself or as a stocking stuffer or thoughtful gift for a friend."
2205,1,"Miracle product_I'm not a nail expert, and don't get manicures regularly.  I sometimes get pedicures or do my own pedicures.  But, from the products I've used before (which are limited), I find this to be amazing.  I'm always doing my nails in a rush or before bed, thinking I'm giving myself enough time to let it dry... yet somehow I always end up with bedsheet wrinkles, sock texture imprints, or stubbed tips/edges.  This top coat really really worked and is FAST.  It also gives it a nice, thick gloss and I feel makes the color brighter."
3025,1,"A cheap alternative._I used to use the BareMinerals Mineral Veil over my makeup, but decided to start finding frugal alternatives. This is 1/4 the price and does the same thing. It doesn't have any nasty ingredients, has no color/glitter/shine, doesn't make me break out, and sets my makeup just as well as its more expensive counterpart. The only downside I have for this product is that it comes with a useless brush every time I buy it. Overall, unless BareMinerals' finishing powder magically becomes the same price, I'll never go back."
7682,1,"love the texture of the Pond's towelettes_The Pond's name is almost synonymous with cold cream which is the first thing I think of when I think of waterless makeup removal, so I was eager to try these Pond's wet towelettes.I was not disappointed. The Pond's towelettes do a good job of removing makeup--even eye makeup. They don't leave a greasy residue and they don't dry out my skin.I consider myself to be a soap and water girl but I usually keep makeup remover towelettes on hand for occasional use. I've used several brands including Olay and Philosophy and several generics like CVS and Walgreens. The Pond's towelettes do a better job of makeup removal than most of the ones I've tried although there is not a whole lot of difference in how they work. However, the real beauty of these is in the texture of the fabric. They have a diamond weave that does a good job of cleaning without feeling rough or scratchy. The towelettes also seem to be thicker and a much better quality than others I've used. They hold up very well and have a luxurious feel."
5320,1,love my_new drill it works great for me its worth the money and far better than the pink one please dont buy the pink one stick to this one its better and the cord is better too
7226,1,Made by german company_Cuticle nipper is very sharp and you have to be careful not to over do it. Other tools seem bit heavy but they are made of steel.
1336,1,"fast!_I'm notorious for smudging my nails right after I paint them, I'm so impatient.  A spritz of this and my nails dry much faster."
4038,1,"good stuff_Smells like Apricots, creamy lather, hair appears smoother but no more moisture than any other product. Feels gentle and not harsh"
9590,1,"good shampoo, a little conditioning_I like this shampoo, I think it smells good and it seems to be quality, it doesn't strip your hair and makes your hair soft, it lathers well and rinses well. It is thick and creamy and makes loads of creamy lather. My hair looks shiny and is soft after it dries. I would recommend this shampoo to man or woman. The scent is mild so no worries about clashing smells."
4916,1,"Good for skin_I like this product because it does help with the rejuvenation. Not only that it is pure natural or organic it actually works. Lately, I don't really have to wear makeup. Although, it will make your skin peel for the first time, I think that it might be the rejuvenation process. I actually have to mix this with other essential oils like lavender and argan oil so that it is not so potent or strong for my skin type."
1762,1,"Worth it_My hair is definitely getting longer for sure, it really shows, but as for it making my hair thicker, I loose hair a lot, it's not as promising as some of the reviews on here. I don't mind it cause I just want my hair to be longer and since I'm only 17 my hair will still grow thicker, but if you're older and are looker for something to mainly make your hair thicker and get rid of balding, I don't recommend it.Idk why people don't like the smell and said it smells horrible, but I personally don't mind it. It has a herbal minty smell, I guess people who don't like it probably wanted the sexy shampoo smell, but it's really not that bad, it's very light.Although I do have to say I don't like how it makes the hair look greasy"
3186,1,"Works extremely well and lasts!_I've been adding this to my John Frieda foam color, 3VR for over a year. I have a lot of gray (25%+) and this helps the color sick to the gray amazingly well. It also helps my color stay better overall. My grays are admittedly, a little lighter than the rest of my color, but it looks like natural highlights. My color stays true until it's time to color again, which is difficult for red shades, I know. I've gotten compliments on my 'red' when I'm due to hit my roots, so I can tell the color remains true.Last night, I went to color and realized I was out of this. I colored anyway, and was not happy that the color did not take as well at all. My grays were 'pinkish' and the rest of my roots didn't have the richness I was used to (I have an ashy dark brown natural color) so I'll have to redo them soon. Bummer.I use one packet in the bottle before I add the developer, then mix it according to the package directions.For me, it's a great product that helps color adhere overall much better."
8934,1,Pretty good_I wanted the natural ones but i got white. Oh well it does the job and people allways compliment me on how my nails look once i finish designing them. So these work pretty well.
9570,1,"Pick it up if you prefer a more masculine scent instead of a fruity or floral smell_If you ever wondered what &#8220;peace&#8221; smells like, well, as it turns out it&#8217;s a whole lot like men&#8217;s cologne. Based on the sort of persona Axe usually ports forth, I&#8217;m guessing they are going for &#8220;we&#8217;ve achieved peace because everyone is hooking up instead of going to war after smelling our shampoo,&#8221; but whatever, it actually smells pretty good, with a scent that&#8217;s strong but not overpowering. As far as keeping your hair clean, dandruff free, and maintaining luster without getting oily, it works as well or maybe even a little better than any other brand sitting on shelves. If you like masculine scents instead of fruity or floral ones, give this one a try."
8397,1,"The many wonderful colors of this nail art tape go well with any nail art design!_This was a great bargain and there are many colors to choose from. For the price, it was a great deal and I recommend it highly. The only negative was it is thin tape. It serves its purpose in both nail art painting, and as nail art decals. I like it very much."
4479,1,"Babyliss flat iron_I've been a Chi flat iron girl pretty much since they were invented, however, none of my chi irons have lasted longer than a few years, which seems silly, since they cost nearly $100.  I decided to try the babyliss iron for around $40 a few weeks ago and I am SOLD!  It works just as well or better than the chi, and has adjustable heat settings.  For the money, I'll stay with this brand."
8184,1,"It's working_I have been massaging my thighs and the backs of my arms with this cream for a week now and I am able to see some progress.  This skin on the back of my arms is visibly smoother.  The cream is thick so it allows you to really massage deep into your thighs.  It's working, who could ask for more."
1925,1,"Not for limp, fine hair_Other reviewers have also noted that this product is most likely intended for African-Americans.  European-Americans would not benefit so much from this oily product unless they had thick, curly hair.  I do like the scent, but what this product does is more coat the hair rather than get absorbed in the follicles.  For those with permed or otherwise damaged hair a small dab on the ends after a washing also seems to do the trick, adding oil to the hair ends to keep it from flying around.I do like the scent, which is why I give it four stars."
1593,1,"I Love It_I received a sample of this (a rather large sample) in the Organic Root Stimulator Olive Oil perm and didn't really use it then but put it in my cabinet of products that I use on occasion. I am trying to transition my hair to natural and away from perms (2 1/2 months going strong) and decided to go through that cabinet to see what products I had that would work and what products I needed to add to a shopping list. I found this hiding in the back. I washed my hair a few days ago and conditioned it, which left it nice and somewhat nourished, however I used this lotion and my hair is like silk! I have never had hair this silky, ever and I am glad I didn't do what I normally do when perms give me extra products and toss it out. I am here to buy the bigger bottle of lotion. I am very satisfied and very shocked at how my hair straightens without making my hair tough and brittle-feeling like most products do. I truly recommend this!"
3990,1,"Great alternative to a spa treatment_I have extremely dry skin which is also very product sensitive. I was wary about investing in this product despite the fact that my skin does quite well with Olay products. When I was given the opportunity to try it via Vine, I jumped at the chance.The product consists of the serum, which has the consistency of a light lotion and reminds me a discontinued department store product that was the best thing I even used on my skin, and five nights worth of masks. I believe that the lotion on the masks is the same as the serum. The idea is to use just the serum in the mornings and do five nights of the mask. The mask takes only 15 minutes but when you have two kids who demand constant attention, it's difficult to find any time. They were freaked out by the mask, just in case you also have little ones you might be working with during your treatment.The mask does stay on fairly well if you're sitting up but I found that the jaw section wanted to fall off unless I was lying down. So if you have 15 min of time per night for 5 nights in a row to lie down, this is an awesome way to spend them. The material of the mask reminded me of Olay's daily cleansing cloths: similar to cloth but saturated in the lotion. So if you're familiar with other products in their line, you'll feel comfortable with this.I noticed a difference in the feel of my skin immediately and that feeling has lasted fairly well since I finished the five-day treatment. I can't imagine needing this level of intense moisture outside of winter months but this time of year, my skin got a huge benefit from the firming kit.Was my skin firmer? I can't say yes or no. It was most definitely more hydrated. My hands were also more hydrated as I massaged the mask while in place, massaged the excess lotion into my face following the mask and rubbed the remainder into my hands.I did have some whitehead breakouts on day 2-4 at my lipline and at the corner of my nose, both places where there was an edge of the mask. The mouth opening of the mask was quite small and I have a small (literal, not figurative) mouth. Women with wider mouths, eyes or noses might find the mask does not fit well but it could easily be cut to accommodate your features.If I have super dry skin next winter, which I likely will, I would try this product again. If your skin concerns are different, I would imagine that based on my experience, you would do well with other targeted products in this line."
8040,1,"Sturdy nails_I have searched all over for quality nails to swatch my large nail collection. I eventually found these and my searching is done. They are sturdy and I did a break test on one of them to see how quickly the nail would snap off the handle. And it took quite a bit of force. I don't much care for the screw thing they came with, So I just strung a bit of wire through the holes and use that to hang them up. The stick part is great for writing on the names of the colors and the nails are easy to work with. Some did need a bit of filing to get rid of sharp edges. I have ordered more because I found I have WAY more nail polish than I originally thought. I bought the white nails for solid colors and the clear for glitter colors, so that I could layer them on top of each other and see how a glitter and solid would look together without having to put it on my own nails and take it off. Its very easy."

1199,1,"Nice lotion; I recommend using with the Kai oil rollerball._I smelled the Kai oil rollerball in a spa and loved it. I bought the spray perfume, since that is what I tend to prefer. I actually did not like the spray as much as the rollerball, and I am not sure why. Anyway, I bought this lotion to see if I could enhance the spray perfume. It definitely does work to enhance the spray perfume and increase the staying power, and I like the perfume more now that I have the matching lotion. As a lotion, it does work better than many other scented lotions. It is thicker and kept my hands from feeling dry without feeling greasy.This scent is very floral. If you do not like floral perfumes, I don't recommend this. If you tend to like florals (as I do), I recommend this lotion. I think it would be very nice on its own as well - the scent is pleasant and would likely last awhile without the accompanying perfume or rollerball."
2052,1,"Good, but not perfect_This concealer is thick without being caky, which is great for hiding blemishes and redness. It blends right in to my fair skin and lasts all day. I did not find it oily or irritating.The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I bought it to hide my very dark, and unfortunately hereditary, under-eye circles. It definitely hides them a bit, but I don't think it works noticeably better on them than other concealers. If I put too much on them it just looks fake. However, it's still a good concealer that I would recommend."

216,1,"Universal Product_I had another brand of Tea Tree oil that did not work as well as this one. So I know the quality of this Tea Tree Oil is GREAT! I initially bought it to use on a cold sore and let me tell you it demolished it in a couple of days!! The cold sore had already grown and it was big and yucky. I wet a q-tip pour some drops of this on it and dabbed it on the cold sore 3 times a day, let dry for about 30 minutes and the cold sore and scab was practically gone!Please note: I did apply Neosporin on top of the Tea Tree after it dried because it dry the cold sore up so much that it can crack and make you bleed and make it worst!! Make sure to wash the cold sore three times a day, ice it with an ice cube for about 3 minutes, then apply the tea tree oil, let it dry for about 30 mins then apply the Neopsporin on top. The Neosporin and Tea Tree as a team does a hell of a job in getting rid of a cold sore!! It is also great on acne! get it!!!Update:: Be sure to take Lysine supplements this keeps cold sores away and they also have Lysine lip balm as well."
2926,0,Didn't Work On My DAughter's Curly Hair_I'm not pleased with the results I had when I bought this one thinking it would be best for my bi-racial daughter's curly hair.  It just weighed her hair down and didn't hold her curls at all. The Tea Tree Cleansing Conditioner did much better with her hair.  One size does not fit all in this case.
4519,0,"ORANGE_Light shows up orange against my very pale skin, and looks cakey and dry even when I moisturize and only apply a little. Not good coverage on red spots and pimples, even when you layer it on, you can still see the red through the orange.I don't get why this product is so highly rated here, but on Makeupalley it's rated very poorly."
8878,1,"Salon Strength Hair Dryer_Remington's Pearl Pro Dryer has all that is needed for that salon finished hair.  Three heat modes, two speeds, cool shot and heavy duty motor make this one nice dryer.  This should last a good long time.  Well worth getting for all those hair drying needs and it's shiny black too."
3173,1,"Easy-on eyeliner but needs touch-ups through the day_Good eyeliner....goes on easy, but doesn't last real long, and does have a tendency to smudge.  On the other hand, sometimes I like the easy-on, smudgy look (at least on the upper lids!)  It's convenient that there is a &#34;smudger&#34; on one end of the pencil - and I use that to fill in the eye brows.  So for me, this works, but it all depends on the look you're trying to achieve.  The price is right!"
5752,1,"Nice brushes_These brushes are very soft and apply make up well.Foundation brush- is very small, too small to use for foundation. Instead I use it to apply under eye concealer.Detailer brush- perfect for spot concealing and to clean around your eyebrows and lipsBuffing brush- smaller than regular buffing brushes but can also be used for blush or contouringContouring brush- perfect for sharp contouring and can also be used to set under eye concealer with powderOverall, the brushes are good. The are very versatile and can be used for manny different purposes, the only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because it comes with a foundation brush that's unusable for foundation."
7099,1,"great peel_I love this peel and i think it is alsmost as good as the professioinal peeling product i get at a spa, however, i have noticed changes in consistency of the product after 1 year.. it got looser in consistency and less potent, i guess it is time to reorder : )"
2877,1,"My wife loves it_My wife owns a Beauty Salon in Costa Rica. Max Factor mascara cost $33 in Walmart. I purchased this item for less than $10 on Amazon. Mrs. Lee has used many mascaras over 24 years in business, she said it is Best she and her customers have ever used!!"
2621,1,"Awesome product!_It took me 4 decades to figure out how to keep my hair from being dry and frizzy.  I have been using this conditioner, the gel and the shampoo for a year now and I will never switch again.  I get compliments on my curls every single day.  The only compliment I got before was &#34;Nice haircut&#34;.  Now everyone wants to know how I get these curls.  I finally stopped fighting my curly hair and let it do it's own thing with little help from me.  I finally know what it is like to have moisturized hair that is pleasing to the touch.  This product also gives a beautiful shine.  Love it love it love it!"

I'm a brown Asian and I have tried a lot of different products. Soap is meant for cleaning our skin so I just stopped using these and started using a bacterial soap. haha."

2904,1,"I can finally sleep when my husband wants to read!_The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was that it is just a bit too heavy on my nose.  The design is a little too large for my face.  If I adjust it upward so that it doesn't put too much pressure on my nose, then the eye 'pockets' sit at my eyebrows rather than over my eyelids.  This said, I do appreciate the total blackout that this gives.  I can finally sleep, even when my dear husband has the lights on for reading, or is staying up on the computer.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend."

9207,0,"Color is NOT Black_I love the look of this messy bun and if I had medium brown hair like my daughter it might have been perfect.  However my hair is Black, I ordered Black, thinking the color would be black.  Nope....Medium brown.  I hold it up to my hair & it makes it look like its got red tones...lol  So....guess I'll give it to my girls or someone else.  If u have black hair, DO NOT order.  If you have dark/medium brown hair...then order the black one. It will be perfect for that color & really cute."
6420,0,"Not as effective as wraps_I am really disappointed in this product.  It is exactly as it says.  I had no issue with leaking or product quality, but soaking in acetone like this isn't as effective in removing gel polish as wrapping in foil.  I really like the OPI wraps.  When I have the time I do one hand at a time and reuse the wraps to save money.  They seem much more effective in the same amount of time as soaking in these trays.  Also, I tried to pour the unused acetone back in the bottle, but because of the curve of this product it went everywhere but back in the bottle.  A real mess.  This method uses more acetone.  I think the less acetone on your skin the better, so I'm going back to wraps."
746,1,"fast- quick bleach_I have dark blonde hair, and I like to make sure that my hair is light blonde- this is the most effective and fastest way to get there- with the least damage to my hair! 8-10 minutes on with 20 volume- and done ;)"

4766,1,"Great Results_I had no idea how ineffective my old flat iron was. The plates weren't sleek. It took forever to heat up and when it did the heat was uneven. It felt like a toy and had zero features.Not so with the S9500. This flat iron performs well and has features that I'm finding I won't live without again. For example, the S9500 produces an audible beep when the iron reaches the desired temperature. And you set the temperature precisely. In addition, the iron will automatically shut off after an hour, so you never have to worry when you leave the house.The plates of the iron are sleek and substantial. Hair effortlessly glides between them. In addition, the S9500 has a good ergonomic feel to it. Weight is balanced and it's easy to manipulate in order to achieve the results you want. Overall, I'm very pleased to have replaced my old stinker iron with this one."
6111,0,"disappointed_While the rhinestones were pretty and of good quality, there were NOT 2400 in the wheel. Of the 2 I counted, black had 160 and pink had 140. I thought that the reviews stating the wheel having this type of shortage were aberrations. However, they were right on.How people can accept this is beyond me. Be aware before purchase. I returned the wheel. There are many other good buys on Amazon which I will get one when my return is processed."
7865,1,"Great Eyeshadow palette!  This is a great product_Though I have not bought this product, I really liked the look of the image of it.  When I do run out of eyeshadow from Shany, I will buy this eyeshadow.  In general, I am quite pleased with the eyeshadow from Shany, because they are affordable, and long lasting, and look great for any complexion and skin color.  They are really a great deal for the price.  I am a satisfied customer for Shany cosmetics."
7926,1,"Zinc oxide protects delicate skin_As a youthful beach lover, I used zinc oxide to protect my skin prior to and while surfing.Cotz Pediatric Spf 40, 3.5 Ounceis small enough to be carried on an airplane.  The formula uses zinc oxide to protect skin from the sun's harmful rays as an SPF of 40.  The small tube should suffice a weekend trip to the beach with conscientious reapplications as directed every couple hours.  Having no noxious scents, the cream can be rubbed into dry skin and it does protect.  I've experienced no irritation or negative effects on my sensitive skin but I have noted a residual coating on things which have ome into contact with me while I've been wearing the product.  Because it's quite expensive, I will not suggest that my niece in Tampa use it for her baby instead of her current sunscreen, but will keep it in mind for weekend trips because of its small size.  It's a good product but zinc oxide really isn't very expensive."
1854,0,The colors online are misleading_The fact that I hate this is because it is not the color I thougt I was getting when I saw the on-line colors.  Someone else might love it.
9225,1,"Dark_These colors are all actually quite dark. Out of the 12, I only loved 4 of them :( the rest I gave to my teenage daughter. I usually purchase entire seasonal collections without a problem - but these? No.When I say dark, I'm not kidding! They almost all look practically black in the bottle, and don't lighten up much when applied."
2810,1,"The best for sensitive skin!_I have been using this  for 30+ years. My dermatologist recommended it to me for sensitive, easily irritated, and sometimes dry skin. I've used both lotion and cream. The cream is best for body and limbs, the lotion is better for hands only.  My doctor's words to me of 'don't bestingy' with it were a good guide. I tried everything else on the market, nothing soothed my skin like this cream. Yes, it's thick. It's wonderful!!!  It helps in allergy season, in the winter when the heater is running and every other time of the year. When we were in WY and the dry wind sucked all the moisture out of my skin, this is what I used for relief. I can't live without it."
5410,1,"Good stuff!_I bought this as a recommendation from someone and love it.  I have chronic purpley, dark circles under my eyes and this stuff covers it up beautifully.  I use a concealer brush to apply (after foundation, but to each their own) then set it with a translucent powder and setting spray.  Definitely recommend this product to people have issues with under eye circles!"
4136,1,"Absolutely amazing!_I bought this product thinking I was probably throwing away good money only to be disappointed by another product that didn't deliver the results promised.  Wrong!  I am 64 years old and I noticed that the instructions say that those over 30 (and I'm more than twice that!) could benefit by using it twice a day.  So that was what I determined to do.At first my eyelids burned a little.  Again, the instructions say this will go away in three to five days.  For the first three days my eyelids were red and looked like I had on some eye shadow.  But that cleared up quickly and I had no problems after about four days.I'm retired and don't wear makeup every day any more.  So after about five days I put on some mascara and was blown away.  Already the results were showing!  My eyelashes had become very skimpy and even with several coats of mascara they would hardly show.  I asked my husband if he could see any difference.  He can be brutally honest, so I trusted his opinion.  He said there was a definite difference.About a week later we were going out for the evening so I put on my makeup.  Wow!  With one coat of mascara I could see my lashes looking fuller than ever.  Believe me, this stuff will be a permanent part of my beauty routine!  I'm a natural blond so my lashes are very light and have always been thin.  I'm so impressed with this product.  The first few days of sensitivity are long forgotten and the results are fabulous!UPDATE AFTER ONE MONTH:  I love this product.  It's now out of stock at Amazon, but I have put in an order so I don't miss it when they get some in.  I now use it once a day and my lashes are so much thicker and longer.  Really amazing.  I still need to use mascara because my lashes are naturally blond and this hasn't made a noticable difference in the darkness. I am amazed at the results using this product!"
8449,1,"Clear Results_The plan was to try this product for a few weeks and see what my results were. I had no idea that after only one use, I would already see visible results. So without a lot of detail on ingredients (you can find those up in the product information section) I'm going to give it to you straight.My hair before use: naturally thick, wavy, coarse, dry and damaged. Not just damaged, but SUPER damaged. I have been coloring, using keratin smoothing treatments, heat drying, and flat ironing my hair for some time now. It has finally gotten to the point where it doesn't look nice at all. I was worried I would have to cut it all off real short and start over.How I used this product: I followed directions by washing my hair with my regular shampoo. Note: I do NOT use the shampoo from this manufacturer. I use a sulfate free shampoo.I then towel-dried my hair just enough to get all the water out. Then I applied the treatment mask to my wet hair. I used quite a bit, maybe more than needed but my hair was badly damaged and I figured more would not hurt. I made sure to really work it into my scalp, as that is where you are supposed to concentrate this product.I them combed it through my hair. When my hair was fully coated, I wrapped it up in a terry cloth turbi-twist turban and and went about other activities. The packaging instructions say to leave on for about 3 minutes. I left it on quite longer. Possibly a half hour or so. I did this because again, my hair was so damaged. I am sure next time I will leave it on for less.After leaving it on for what I felt was sufficient, I rinsed the product out completely. Then I lightly towel dried my hair and let air dry a little as I normally do. I used a blow dryer to dry my hair, finger styling as I did so. I will note now that I use a separate leave-in smoothing cream on my hair daily. I have been using this same brand for some time and as well as it works, I still had dry frizzy ends until I flat iron. I did not skip this step when using the treatment mask.My results: After blow drying my hair completely, I could already see noticeable results. My hair was silky, shiny and unbelievably softer than before. I had not even used the flat iron yet and I didn't have my crispy little ends like usual.Today I washed my hair as normal using my regular conditioner. I was curious to see if the results would last or they were just after the use of the treatment mask. Well, my hair looks the same! Beautiful, soft and shiny. I have to say I never expected to see that much improvement from one use. I really can't wait to see how much better it is next time.The instructions say to use biweekly. I may use in one week for the second time and then switch to every other week.Overall I am truly impressed with this product and will gladly use it again and again. I finally found something that really works on my dry damaged hair. It's also affordable and available where I shop , so I don't have to visit a salon or beauty supply store ."
2802,1,Lovely_I used head and shoulders before. Switched to try this stuff out and I was blown away. The texture of my hair is so smooth and soft now. My hair is also so shiny and I've only used this stuff twice. This shampoo and the conditioner make a great duo. New holy grail!  And I can't complain about the price either :)
4293,1,"Shea moisture deep treatment masque!!_I love this masque! Each time I have used this product it has left my hair feeling both strong and soft!! Excellent product, however I do recommend that If you are on the look out for this product I'd suggest shopping at target or Walgreens because the seller on here is too expensive!"
4413,0,"Origins_proactive i use to use until i tried origins from macys. Origins is all natural and works for a lot of skin types. I break out very easily and it has really controlled my breakouts, on top of that its all natural and they use plant material."

1459,1,"I love this cologne_I bought this cologne spray in the 3.4 oz size for my husband 3 years ago.  He's still using it up - he uses this cologne every day, 365 days a year - so this bottle is going to last you quite a long time.  My husband likes this Carlos Santana cologne, and I flippin' love it on him.  I don't think you can go wrong with this.  I can't tell you much about fragrance notes, but I can tell you that I still love it after smelling it on my hubby every day for 3 years."
5457,1,"Shampoopie and airConditioner_This duo was a good deal and it makes my hair nice and such. It smells like bubblegum though, which I can kinda get sick of, but it's not that bad lol... But it does the job right for my hair so I can't really complain too much :P"
4636,1,I like it_I recieved My 3rd edition palette and it was packaged very nicely and the colors as I stated before on my last review are very pigmented and beautiful. The only problem that I had with this palette was that one of the colors was cracked. But all in all everything else was great and it all i expected it to be and more.
3082,1,"Dry lipsticks_I love this lipstick even though it is drying to the lips, but a quick fix for me is just putting on a lip moisturizer. For other girls that have dry lips I do not recommend this lipstick. It tends to make the lines of your lips show off more."

8576,1,"So Awesome!_These work great! Just what I wanted for my nail art and it got to me super fast! Got it with in a week and normally it takes up to 3 weeks when I order stuff from China but not this, the product was in perfect shape and I will defiantly order from them again."
5106,1,"Its about Time!!!_I am of mix race Affrican American/white female with long natural curly hair, I have tried so many differect shampoos and conditioners all promising the same thing.... I orginaly bought the edge controll from Walmart and it works very well in my hair. I saw this product in CVS for $20.00 buck a bottle, I decided to come on Amazon to see if I can get it for less and I was so happy when I did. I washed my hair and did not put any other product in it. I let it air dry and when I woke up this morning my curls were so soft and light I put in a little of the Argan oil and left for work. I live/work/play in FL so I needed something that can stand up to the heat. I LOOOOOOOVE this product and from now on this is my shampo/conditioner. Its a great product and worth the money especialy if you have mix hair or curly hair. You will not need to put all those other product in your hair to make it look nice or to make your curls last, just wash dry and oil and your good to go. I have also used this in my daughters hair who in at the tailk end of transioning from a perm so her hair is part curly and part straight and this product did wonders for her hair in just one shampoo."

5226,1,"Using the anti-aging trio to help with smile, eye and neck lines_I have a few 'lines' on my face I've been trying to come to terms with since they showed up one day. The first were the little creases that show up around the mouth (laugh lines). They're small right now, but I see them. Especially when I'm applying makeup. While I've been useing light mineral makeup for the last 6 months or so instead of thicker foundation, I still notice that the makeup will over the day, settle into the lines on my face.I also have a small line under each of my eyes, that I notice every time I apply my eyeliner. As much as I try not to pay attention to them, it's hard not to when your makeup actually ends up settling into them. And before the lines on my face, I discovered I have a very significant crease on my neck. While I may be in my early 30's, the 'lines' are slowly sneaking up on me, and just putting a little moisturizer on my face isn't making them go away.So for the last several weeks I've been using the Perfective Ceuticals anti-aging system to see if it would help with my situation. I've been using this Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor and also the Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor and Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy with Growth Factor. I've been using them in the recommended order of first applying the serum, then applying the eye cream, then finally this face cream.The first changed I noticed was that after the first few weeks, my makeup wasn't settling into my smile lines as much anymore. Some days I can't see the lines at all. Next I started noticing that I had less and less problems applying my eye makeup, since it wasn't bleeding into the tiny lines under each of my eyes. Before the lines themselves started to fade, my makeup was showing my the difference, by not settling into them. I've been quite pleased with how well this anti-aging system has worked, and have noticed some fading now also on the much more obvious neck crease. I'm looking forward to seeing just how much it will continue to smooth out my skin, with continued use. The trio of anti-aging facial products works well to target each area specifically, and all at the same time. I'm very happy with how well they work together.A sample was provided for reviewing purposes."
4282,1,"Great Lather but it doesn't..._It is a great shampoo that lather and giving moisturze depending on different hair condition. Or what you put there. A lot ppl complain it doesn't moist. but it will if you put oil or something else there. It also depend on your hair condition. It may not clarify for a  lot ppl, but it lather that seem enough to clarify. If you use a lot amount and massage through , it might be deep cleanse. I can't guarteen but it still great shampoo with moistursing better than other organic and commerical."
8932,1,"Getting the job done_I received these a few days ago. The shipping took a while. But they arrived in good condition. I agree with other reviews that it can be difficult to remove the case for filling the bottles, but with a little elbow grease it works out. I've used one so far and it sprays well. It actually holds a good amount of perfume, so you shouldn't have to refill that often. A few people mentioned losing perfume, but if you hold the bottle exactly next to your perfume spray top, the loss is negligible if any."
9465,1,"amazing stuff_I have tried several combinations of shampoo and conditions, always trying to replicate what my hairdresser does.  I was up to 5 products to get my hair to look decent.  I have been using the Fekkai shampoo, condition and mousse now for a week and love that it does everything in very few steps.  I get a salon quality finish with a wonderful scent.  The mousse comes out through a nozzle and a little can go a long way.  My biggest issue is that the mousse comes out rapidly with just a quick touch.  You only need a palm size pouf (even less would work) for my shoulder length hair.  I have highlighted / low lighted hair and have found no downgrade to my color."
4829,1,Amazing color_This is a great color especially for the holidays. It works really well and i've gotten a lot of compliments. Looks just like the salon shellac manicures!
7970,1,"these are nice and a really good deal for the money!_Buying something like this from most stores costs $3-$6 for just one pair. Over the years I have purchased a few from stores thinking it would be fun to wear for a special occasion, event, or even a costume, and I almost never was able to ever get them on correctly and gave up, or if I did sort of get them on, I thought they looked crazy and took them back off anyway, or they didn't stay on for long because they peeled up and fell off. So, being someone who doesn't wear false eyelashes frequently and since I did just recently figure out how to successfully apply them correctly, I decided that under $4 for 10 pairs was a bargain even if they weren't reusable (like some are), and if nothing else, I could get some practice applying them. These are great, they are just as good quality as the name brand ones from the beauty stores. They stayed on every time I've worn them, and they are reusable too. If I was to give anyone tips on wearing false eyelashes, I'd tell them to save their money & buy these, brush them out a little before applying them to separate and soften them, just be gentle while handling or cleaning them, and then to get some really good glue, the brand I think works the very best is Duo."
3342,1,"Inexpensive and effective!_I LOVE this line of children's shampoo!  You simply cannot beat the quality you get for such a low price.  It's so much easier than trying to use a shampoo and conditioner separately with young children.  Plus, it won't hurt them if they get some in their eyes.  I also find that the really young ones like the cute picture of the monkey on the front and that helps to keep them focused when you're trying to wash their hair.It smells divine - I just love the coconut scent.  Especially in the summer time.  I even use it on my Golden Retriever sometimes just because I love to smell his fluffy coconutty smelling fur as I run my fingers through it.I highly recommend this whole line of Suave kids shampoo and conditioners!"
5234,1,"Kerry's Rosewood- Amazing_I bought this in Kerry's Rosewood and I am in love.  The shade is perfect for any skin tone and looks great on everyone.  It is a shimmery peachish pinkish that isn't too bright or too drab, just right!  It is perfect to wear to work because it looks natural but still gives off a shimmery pink hue, without looking too done up.  It is a few shades off from my natural lip color, so it looks amazing with any other color combination I match with it.  Stays on forever and looks amazing.  Lips stay soft and smooth and the color doesn't run off my lips either.  Love it!!!"
188,1,"Awesome product for blondes!_I've had really light blonde hair all my life.  When I was little it was almost snow white and I hated it because it made me stand out from the other little girls, but as I got older and it darkened just a little, it was a beautiful shade. The exception is when I spent a lot of time in the sun, then it would turn to that fake looking bleach blonde again and nobody ever believed it was natural.  Now that I'm even older, my hair has thankfully become a slightly darker blonde, and for a few years now the roots have started turning a champagne shade. Every couple of months I will spray a little Sun In and massage it into the roots for maybe 2 days in a row, then blow dry it, and that is good for a couple more months.  It lightens it enough to where it looks more like the other grown out hair, but not fake.  After spraying, the roots are a tad bit of a darker blonde, so it looks totally natural.  I use a really good leave-in conditioner so it never dries out my hair, as some people have mentioned it does to their hair.  I have read comments where people say they can't believe they make this product anymore because the number of true blondes is decreasing, but I for one hope they always have it around for minorities like me!  Someday I'll probably just let my hair go to it's natural champagne shade, as my grandma's and dad's did, but until then, I'll be using Sun In regularly."
5640,0,"Great, if you like black chunk-like spectacles in your eyes!_I bought this eyeliner a few months ago and only used it a few times because every single time I would go to use it, little black chunks would fall off into my eye. The color was great and after I got the black chunk like spectacles out of my eye it would look good, but I am not going to risk getting an infection or something from it. Normally I would of gave it to my sister since she isn't as picky about makeup as I am, but this eyeliner I wouldn't even give to her, instead I donated it to the trash can. It may have been just the one I bought, but I am not going to give it another chance to see if it was."
3742,1,"Nice Detail_It was a little difficult to use at first but once you get the hang of it, it's a bit easier. The nail polishes I have don't work as well so I assume you need the special polish in order for it to work perfectly."
5493,0,"Will Not Dry Thick Wavy Hair_Don't get me wrong it is well contructed, but it just does not dry my wet thick wavy long hair. The only way this item could work for me if if I were to dry my hair 90% with a blow dryer than used this to style it. Unfortunately that would defeat the point. Sending mine back. Probably will work very well on fine medium length hair."
4162,1,Tips to using it!!!_So far I love this product it is the perfect color and makes my skin feel great. BUT haha I have learned that once you put it on if you don't blend immediatelyit is streaky XD OOPS but other then that it goes on great. And I would buy it again
163,1,"Your Face Will Thank You_I've been using Nivea's face scrub for years, and I would never consider washing my face with any other product. The scrubbing elements in this product gently scrape the dirt and dead skin from your face, and leave it feeling revitalized and really clean. If your skin is oily, or if you work in a humid or otherwise grimy environment, then you will certainly appreciate this scrub. I use it after taking a shower and/or right before I shave. I feel that even when my face is not particularly grimy, this scrub helps me get a smoother-feeling face that is much easier to shave. Overall, this is a great product that has become and integral part of my personal care arsenal."
2020,1,One of the best!_I have been using this stuff off and on for years. It is one of the best deep conditioners out there and its cheap. It leaves my hair feeling soft and in much better condition.
1407,1,"Terrific For Every Skin_This is a go to moisturizer for people. Aveeno has a positive reputation where ever you go. It is a well known product.This is a  nourishing lotion which contains Colloidal Oatmeal blended with rich emollients to moisturize skin for a full 24 hours. I think it improves the health of my skin in 1 day with significant improvement in 2 weeks. It helps prevent and protect dry skin, it leaves skin feeling soft, smooth and naturally healthy-looking. It is gentle enough for everyday use, fragrance free, nongreasy, and noncomedogenic.I have been using the for several years and keep it in my bathroom.Recommended. prisrob 06-05-13"
1089,1,"not sure yet_The cream has a unique aroma.  Almost like coffee.  I don't mind it.  In terms of the effectiveness of the product's claims, I can't be sure.  Still waiting.  But it feels nice on."
5138,0,meh._Didnt do anything for me. I love my regular WEN cleansing conditioner. But this - I wouldnt waste your money.
1848,1,2nd pair for downstairs : )_love these had a pair for years and wanted another... obviously they last and work for me... happy happy : )
8952,1,"Great mask for women_The US Diver's mask and snorkel are perfect for women.  The slightly smaller size means that it won't gap and leak at the sides.  The neoprene strap cover is a nice touch since there is less chance of getting your hair pulled than with just the bare strap.  The snorkel tube is round and flex between the tube and mouthpiece has a fair amount of give.  This makes it easy to move the snorkel out of the way when not needed.  Snorkel also has a purge valve and one-way valve to make snorkel clearing easier.  Good, high quality, mask and snorkel.The color is also really cute! I love the aqua, and while it makes no difference in performance it looks really nice."
9120,1,excellent razor with very convenient trimmer_The razor is well designed and easy to hold and grip without slipping.  It gives a nice close she on my legs with no nicks bumps or scratches.  I'm impressed with the razor but it's such a bonus to have the trimmer attachment.  It makes it very convenient and is easy to slide on and off the razor head.  Love this razor.
3346,1,"Kids Like It, Parents Like.  Win-Win_We use this stuff on our two boys who both like the scent, it doesn't hurt their eyes, and even picture on the bottle.  Us parents like it because of its low price, tear-free, gentleness, and shampoo+conditioner combo.  We used to use a Suave all in one (shampoo+conditioner+body wash) product and were happy with it.  However, after we switched to this 2-1 product we noticed the kids hair was really softer and much more manageable.  I have one boy with pretty short hair and you can tell it is much softer.  My other son has fairly long hair and this stuff has really helped to keep the crazy bed head manageable in the mornings.  Whether these improvements are due to the product itself or just the fact that it is designed for hair and not hair and body, I can't say for sure.  However, due to the results, low cost, and my kids liking it (or at least not disliking it) we would likely be repeat buyer.  Admittedly, it would be MUCH nicer if it had a lower EWG Hazard Score.  It carries a score of 4 out of 10 (lower better)."
6136,1,Pretty_Can't wait to start having lots of fun creating some sparkly nail art. Love all the different shapes and sizes!
3587,1,"Love it!_I don't know how I was capable of guessing the correct color online, but I was lucky enough to do so. If you're not sure at all, I would recommend going to a store that sells wigs and checking out the correct color.With that said, I love these bangs. I have no experience with weaves, wigs, clip-in hair or whatever they sell at these stores. But I love getting bangs from time to time, but hate that after a couple of weeks, I'm sick of them and want my long bangs back. So I decided to try this out. I love it! I don't think the product is &#34;shiny&#34;. When I was reading reviews of this product I was very reluctant into getting them because so many people were saying it's shiny and looks too fake. I decided to give it a try anyways. I honestly love it! At first I was disappointed because I had no idea the clips would click open (like I said, no experience with this kind of stuff), and couldn't understand why the damn thing wouldn't stay on. After my brain decided to work correctly, I realized what was wrong and started wearing them. They look like clean hair. If that's what &#34;shiny&#34; means, then I guess they ARE shiny. It blended perfectly with my hair and I love being able to change my face from time to time. The only thing I'll say, is that the bangs are a bit long, at least on my face shape. I had to trim them a little bit, and I did it at home by myself. If you're not crafty, you can take to your usual hair place and I'm sure they'll do it for you.I totally recommend these bangs! They rock!"
3968,1,"Great, but not mint_I actually love this nail polish.  The color really pops on my toes.  However, it is much, much more blue than green.  I ordered this looking for a true mint green color, and that's not what I got."
1181,1,"BETTER THAN A KABUKI!_This provides an airbrushed finish that simply can't be achieved with a kabuki, no matter how good the brush.  When used slightly damp, it performs on a professional level, making it simple and easy to apply foundation and cream concealers even in the hardest and smallest of areas on the face.  I won't use anything else and neither will most make-up artists!"
241,1,"looooong_they are really long, and thick, but it really gives that dramatic boost to your lashes, perfect when youre rocking a black smokey eye, your lashes would never get lost with these"
8492,1,"Who would've thought???_After years, or rather decades, from teen years on I've battled having a tousled look.  Now, it's the thing, and though a guy my age should, I suppose, be super well groomed appearing, I like this styling my hair to be messy sometimes.  That said, of the Axe products, this is the one which helps me achieve my desired effect the easiest.  Highly recommended."
1676,1,"The MOST amazing kid's hair de-tangler invented!_My daughters have hyper-curly, so also hyper-dry, hair.  Since they were little (they are 11 now) comb-through has been a constant daily challenge (I look forward to when they can manage and care for their own hair!)!!I've tried everything I can find has a good review:  Mane and Tail (ok, but leaves a residue that starts to crunch; and can be oily); Deva Curl (can't even remember if this one was memorable for hyper-dry); Just For Me conditioning sprays (too oily and not enough friz control); Hawaiian 12 something-or-other (left crunch and little friz control), Mixed chicks (shampoos mostly, but didn't help with dryness at all); Loo Poo or No Poo (shampoos mostly but also didn't help with conditioning or dryness for hyper curly girls; store stuff (good de-tanglers, but no friz control for curly girls).  (BTW: for superior conditioning 'no poo' shampoo -- Hair one cannot be beat!!!!)It's a 10 leave in hair spray product stands alone!  I have been using it for years on their hair.  So far, they are just too young for daily showers/hair washing (and curly girls should not be doing anything close to daily hair washing!!)I use this as a daily detangler on their AM comb-through (dry hair). Since they shampoo 2-4 times a month, it can leave a little build up over a week's time, so I usually pour 50% water into a 10 oz bottle. If you are shampooing more often, this thinning out of the mixture will probably not be necessary.  I'd have to assume as a full-strength, out of the shower, spray, it cannot be beat!!!!!!But I use it on their hair every day for dry detangling so we need to cut it down, and that saves us money too.  I have not tried the 'lite' version yet because I assume it will be less effective (but less buildup?) and so more expensive to us over time.Seriously: if you have dry hair, curly/dry hair -- this is the stuff.  It is worth every penny it costs since I've not really found anything that even compares to it.I do shop at Amazon for it solely to find super savers shipping savings and I buy about 6 bottles at a time (two kids, daily, lasts me about six months).  I also have not found that the keratin version is an improvement for daily use."
7598,1,Love it_This product is amazing. I received a sample from a magazine and I was hooked. It smooths out my skin and reduces my pores. Make up goes on flawlessly. I recommend this to anyone as it is one of the best skin products that I've seen in a long time. It goes on white and becomes invisible and it is light on the skin and it helps the skin feel softer.
3586,1,"Best lotion from bath and body works!_These days perfume is so expensive so i buy scented lotions from bath and body works instead.And this one is my favorite. It smells so so so good! I do love that lotion moisturizes too. This one makes your skin super soft.I love it! I will buy more soon. This scent is there most popular for obvious reasons,(A) it smells Fantastic , (B) Same as reason A, and (C) Same as reasons A and B.Here is a tip for buying it: Have a receipt from bath and body works, and do the phone survey and get the code for $10 off your $30 purchase, and then go to Bath And Body Works and use the buy 3 bottles get 2 free deal.Each bottle is 10.50 so for 3 bottles it is 31.50 and $10.00 off is 21.50. So you pay 21.50 for 5 big bottles of lotion. Enjoy!"
6533,0,"Broken_When I received the product, I was very disappointed to see how the little sliders were broken and so were the colors. They were all cracked and mixed into different colors. Thus, I was unable to use the colors. The brushes were low-quality and the hairs of the brush fell apart and created a mess. The colors were all over the lip gloss and the makeup had fell apart.The pigments were great, thus, I ended up using it as nail color, mixing the colors with top coat and applying it on my nails! So, I would recommend the others with the same situation as me to do so as well! Would give it one-star, however, because of the use I had with it, I'm giving it two more stars."
9087,1,"Gorgeous - looks like Ruby Slippers_This is a gorgeous, gorgeous color.  If you are into the sandpaper feel nail polishes, you HAVE to try this.  The color is phenomenal!  And in sunlight it sparkles and is just fairy-tale like!"
3908,1,"Light Golden Bronze with SPF_This is my favorite spray, but not always available in drugstores, so am thankful to find it on-line. Always apply spray 10-15 minutes before needed. Provides an even, healthy glow without the guilt."
7929,1,Good_This was just what I was looking for. It's a little cheap and flimsy but for the price that's to be expected. Works great
2244,1,"Totally Love the smell, wish I could use it_I bought this based on reviews and the fact that I love both Eternity & Escape by Calvin Klein.  I was so excited when I got and smelled it (I had never even heard of it).  All was fine the first day. The next time I used it, I began itching where I'd sprayed.  I thought it was a coincidence, so waited a week and wore it again.  This time my arm and neck had a rash--not hives. I had to end up using cortisone cream to get rid of the rash which took a couple of days.So, yes, I have sensitive skin. This is the first time I broke out from perfume. In the past it was only soaps/detergents. If you have any skin allergies to fragrances, soaps, and the like I recommend you try using the store sample a time or two before buying.  I am trying to decide who among my friends will be 'awarded' this used 4 times bottle of heavenly smell. :) It does smell good!"
6606,1,My daughter and I love these!_Great price and fast shipping! :) My daughter and I have been doing some pretty awesome designs with these and we are soooo glad we got them!! :) Highly recommended.
3611,1,Does not pinch_Due to my stigmatisem and near sight when I use most any eye lash curler I pinch my eyelid.  This has an attached plastic guard that you put the curler on the lash and rest the guard on the eyelid then curl.  I get the lash root and not the eyelid.
2200,1,Great Quality!_Great quality!  I have bought many different NOW products and haven't been disappointed yet.  The Bergamot oil is no exception.
9943,1,"fabulous skin care product_great natural facial product. Works on dark / age spots, wrinkles and has been used by Egyptians, american indians since the dawn of their time."
626,1,Perfect_This mirror is a of good quality. I have my vanity next to my walk in shower so this mirror is exposed to all the moisture of the shower as well. It has held up well. I would be lost without it.
3570,1,"So effective, and smells wonderful!_I became addicted to this over the winter, when my hands would get so dry and cracked they were painful.  Things I love about this body butter (which I mostly use on my hands):1)  The smell is fantastic - it really smells like warm honey, and the smell lingers for hours2)  The thickness - it doesn't run all over like some lotions, but it also isn't greasy like vaseline3)  Paraben- and Pthalate-Free.  Wow!4)  It really moisturizes!  I feel like the butter goes deep into the skin, and it really helps protect and heal - again, without the feeling of a pile of greasy vaseline that some other intense therapy lotions have."
8422,1,"great for frizz_This is great shampoo, especially for frizz control. It has a very pleasant and feminine-type scent while in use. It is not overwhelming at all and doesnt last very long after shower. It does a great job at lathering quickly.My wife & especially my daughter, has alot of frizz in her hair and this shampoo did very well to tame it. Before this she was using a kids mousse (Suave Suave Kids Cherry Vanilla Bop Mousse) which also did a good job taming frizz. I think its better and quicker to have a shampoo do this for you though. Overall we can definitely recommend this product."
1419,1,"Chic Paris_I'm not a fan of Paris Hilton. But I adore this fragrance from here! It combines a feminine floral with a sweet citrus and has faint tones of amber and very light musk. (I don't like musk, so if you're with me, take heart..it's very light). Heiress is a very glamorous, sophisticated fragrance. It's gorgeous and perfect for day or evening wear."
183,0,"Caused an Eyelid Infection_A few hours after trying this mascara, my eyelids were swollen and red and my eyes were burning. It got progressively worse before improving.  It was supposed to be hypoallergenic!  It is horrible.  I buy inexpensive mascara all of the time but this one I will stay away from."
3065,1,"Brushes_i got these yesterday, used some today and i have to say they are all really soft no hard bristels at all. I love the case they come in i am really pleased and would totally recommend!"
8087,0,not at all what i expected_Ordered dark brown 22 inch hair... got red hair with string mixed in to the hair. The clips are not neatly sewn in and the extra yellow string used to attach them is left to hang with the length of the hair. When I buy a product i expect it to be a finished product that meets the description. Not happy at all with my purchase.
5064,1,"Good product/good value_I have long, coarse (color-treated ) hair so it is important that I use just the right shampoo.  Due to the heaviness of my hair, I need something for volume in order not to be weighted down, and I also need a sulfate-free shampoo.  I have used other BED HEAD products before and have never been disappointed.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants/needs extra volume without the sulfates of other shampoos.  If it will work on my difficult hair, it should work on everyone!"
5391,1,Great gift set!_This is a great little gift set for a great price. I gave it as part of a gift to a friend and she loved it
1347,1,"Best Lotion Ever_We received a bottle of this lotion at work. As an RN who works in the OR I am constantly washing my hands. This product is amazing. Moisturizes without being at all greasy or oily feeling. Lasts for hours. I liked it so much I searched for it online and was thrilled to find it on Amazon. At home I apply it to my hands and starting rubbing some on my feet every night. Since it is not greasy i don't have to cover my feet with socks. In less than 2 weeks I can't believe the difference in my heels. Dry,cracked heels are now soft and almost completely smooth.  I am VERY sensitive to scents.  This has a light orange scent (like a Creamsicle!) which disappears quickly. Fantastic product!!!"
4909,1,Great eye moisturizer_I've used this product for about a year now. I was introduced to it by an esthetician. There is no irritation and my eyes feel hydrated. I'm a 40 yr old African American women and I've been told countless times that I look 27.
9189,1,My main Mascara &lt;3_Best drugstore mascar ever!!!!!!!
6756,1,"Pleasantly surprised!_Ive heard mixed reviews on this fragrance by Nicole Polizzi (Snooki), but decided to go ahead and purchase it, I have a huge perfume collection. When my package arrived, I put some on and loved the way it smelled! It's not too overwhelming or too sweet smelling. I'm very glad that I purchased this fragrance. I loved it so much, that the day I recieved it,I ordered her other perfume 'Snooki Couture'! I can't wait for it to come in!"
5441,1,Teen colors_Just the right amount of colors to experiment. My Niece love matching her eye shadow to her cloths and this product lets you have fun.
2723,1,"Pretty Good Lotion...._I gave it 5 stars because of value. I give it 4 stars for its uses, it works pretty well. It's value is the reason why I purchased this product. It's economical and long lasting, for the money. You can't beat getting 3 bottles in a pack."
5697,1,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!_I absolutely love these!! I always get compliments on them and love how they look natural. I love the product and have fast they get to me after i order them. I just cant get enough of these!! Would definitely recommend and have to everyone!!
1123,1,MY SIGNATURE COLOR FOR 6 +++ YEARS_LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS COLOR. MATCHES EVERYTHING I WEAR. I WISH IT WASNT DISCONTINUED SO AS LONG AS THE PRICE IS REASONABLE I WILL BUY THIS COLOR UNTIL MY LIPS ARE TO WRINKLED FOR LIPSTICK.. (WHICH WILL NEVER HAPPEN!)
8714,1,the color is grate_When I got the opi nail polish I used it wright away it was grate if anyone ever tell u it isn't they r wrong I love product I get from yall u haven't let me down yet
575,1,"Really cleans kitchen cabinets!_Murphy's Oil Soap has been around a lot longer than we have, and it's still popular because it really works. I keep a spray bottle with Murphy's very well-diluted and use it on the cabinets and counters. Surprise! It also does a good job on the microwave and stove top. I have a very busy kitchen, and always try to stay ahead of the accumulation of grease and food stains. I hate to wear gloves while cleaning, and this product doesn't make me feel like a am cleaning up with toxic waste! It also worked nicely on a coffee table, making it look almost new again. This is a good product, but I recommend that you shop around for a sensible price."
8173,1,"Beautiful rich color_This polish has a nice formula. I use three coats, but two coats will also give full coverage. The color is rich and deep. It is beautiful in both sunlight and indoor lightning. It is a bit deeper than the photo and slightly more glossy (apparently it is a very hard color to photograph). Highly recommended!"
5184,1,It does the job_These pins are firm and don't bend much when used properly. I used it to make a sew in wig and they held up nicely.
1240,1,"Great product_I have naturally curly/wavy hair and am always looking for a good straightener.  This one heated up faster than I could brush my teeth, so that was great.  It beeps when it's heated.  Another bonus.  It seemed to work really well, but the plate was a little small for my liking.  I currently use a Remington, but with wider plates, so it seemed to take too long with this littler one.  I really like the feel of the plates though, and do think it glided through my hair smoothly.  It was nice for getting close to my scalp and would work perfect if my hair was about 3 inches shorter."
3292,0,Hated it_Messy and stained everything.  Now I know hat it is natural and unrefined but we live in a modern age.  Can they manufacture this soap to be more user friendly while rendering results?
8861,1,"Great clippers for the price_I wasn't expecting much from these clippers as the price point is rather low but I'm happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how well they performed.  The kit itself is well put together, although the scissors aren't the highest quality.  The clippers themselves are sturdy, not too heavy, and overall feel well made and put together.  The blade can get hot if you're using the clippers for a prolonged period but not so hot that it'll burn you.  These clippers also feel pretty powerful.  I would compare them in terms of power to the Andis T-Outliner.  I really only have trimmers at home, and the Andis is the most powerful and best performing.  This Remington is comparable, at least in my opinion, in terms of quality but since it isn't a trimmer if you use the blade without any of the attachments you will not get as close a trim as you would with the T-Outliner.  While there are other options for a cheaper price, I think these clippers are excellent and the kit overall is a good bargain."
326,1,"Awesome product._This was the first Astrigent that I have purchased from Thayer and I must say its my fave, I really really like it and the peachy smell is light and settle but u can still smell and enjoy it. Lovin it."
9898,1,"It makes my hair soft and silky, and my hair looks healthy._I really like this shampoo! It makes my hair soft and silky, and my hair looks healthy. The (mostly) healthy ingredient list is a HUGE plus - Dead Sea Mud, Olive Oil, Vitamin E and Aloe Vera. My only disappointment is that is does have a fragrance in it. There really is no need to have Sea Mud, Olive Oil, Vitamin E mixed with a perfume.  I'm usually sensitive to smells from fragrance, but thankfully the scent is light and hardly noticeable. The fragrance aside, I like the shampoo and would recommend it.I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers."
6659,1,very good conditioner_love this conditioner wish I could find in stores instead of having to purchase online works on straight curly all hair types
7406,1,"Great Detangler_I was really pleased with this purchase, it works just like moroccanoil but at a much better price. I have fine blonde hair and this doesn't weigh it down at all! I put a tiny bit in my palms and run it over my wet hair after my shower and before combing. The bottle also lasts forever."
267,1,"a nice color_I was looking for an olive green and this was really close, maybe a slight bit off of what I had pictured but still a beautiful color"
3854,1,NYX BLUSH CINNAMON_This is kind of a bright orangy pink coral color. I love it. It goes with my caramel skin perfectly. It is highly pigmented compared to other blushes. A little goes a long way. It is very satiny as far as texture. Goes on so smoothly. Love it.
3074,1,"Love this flat iron_I received this flat iron as a gift from my big bro. Extremely happy with it, very smooth and gentle on my hair."
1142,1,Love it!_This heat tamer spray is affordable and makes your hair so soft and shiny. I use it without any heat sometimes because I love the feel of my hair with it. It feels pleasantly soft and bouncy.
7172,1,"So many colors to choose from..._These little FIMO clay adornments are really cute.  Their dainty, but not too small.  They look great also!  I like that there is  several colors to choose from.  That way you can color coordinate or contrast.  Great price too!  I would recommend these to any DIY nail artist."
2264,0,I had heard great things..._This stuff totally made me break out in a major way like I haven't in years. Price was right but not worth it.
1913,1,"doctor recommended_My doctor recommended this lotion for some contact dermatitis issues I've had.  It is very gentle on the skin and applies smoothly.  I've had both the pump style and the tub style of this cream (no preference).  CeraVe also makes a very nice facial moisturizer with SPF 30.  I use it every day.  However, if you put it on before some type of sweat-producing activity, the sweat ends up dripping off your face.  It's a very strange feeling, not like normal sweating.  Almost like your face is waterproof, so the sweat just drips off!Also, from the research I've done, it appears that CeraVe is a cruelty-free product.  I haven't seen the Leaping Bunny logo on their products, though."
149,1,"awesome dryer_I picked up this dryer when I was staying some nights at my fiancee's apartment, so I could stash it out of his way when I wasn't there. It folds in half and the cord retracts into the handle, making it very small. I was immediately impressed with the power, I have pretty thick hair but I could completely dry it in just a few minutes. When we got married and bought a house it has stayed on with me, becoming my primary hair dryer. I have used it daily for about 3 years now and it has not faltered, definitely worth it!"
7052,1,great dye to get your hair black_I use this after my henna treatment and man my hair looks so healthy and jet black. I love it. I don't like regular hair dye it smells so toxic. This is healthy for your hair and really makes it look great. The application is messy as hell but it is for sure worthy.
4156,1,"Great base coat or alone_This product is perfect as a base coat to help strengthen nails or alone to help your nails look manicured.I use this under Orly, Ulta, and Sally Hansen polishes and I have not seen a difference with it based on what polishes are used.If you are looking for a 'fake nail' look without getting acrylic, this will not provide this look."
363,0,"Dries out my skin_After reading the other reviews I thought this would be a great facial cleanser. Unfortunately, it just dried out my skin. Which is odd because my skin is oily and it takes a lot to dry it out. I am glad I only bought the small size."
3561,1,"Helps dry winter hands._I love using Burt's Bees products and this is no exception. This has been an excellent hand cream that I usually put on at night when I am going to bed and wake up to smooth moisturized hands. It has a stronger smell, but by no means a bad smell."
781,1,Good product_Favorite eyecream use daily am & pm.
6359,1,My girlfriend loves them_I purchased this set to compliment the Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer that I purchased for my girlfriend. She has to have said 'I love my nails' every 5 minutes for the last 48 hours. It saves her time and money as these coats would be $30 dollars per visit at the nail salon down the block from her house. She doesn't have to make any more appointments for this. 2 Weeks of chipped free nails for her and 2 weeks of no requests for opinions of chipped nails to which I always have to respond with ' no they look fine! 'Guys if you're looking to make her smile:1) Make sure that she has a UV Dryer2) If she doesn't have a UV Dryer buy: Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer it works great. You can even plug the bulbs in for her to make yourself feel a bit more manly after purchasing nail accessories.3) Give her these first and play the dumb guy 'Oh I didn't know you needed a UV Dryer! Can I tan with one of those' 'What do you mean you can't just use these on their own'.4) Look awesome by having the dryer hidden somewhere else or save it until she starts thinking about how she can cut a few corners to afford a UV Dryer.
4188,0,"Not what I'd imagined..._I've used Q-tips my whole life, but--because they suddenly have some sort of chemical on them, no matter where I buy them--I had to seek out another swab.  These swab heads are so huge that you probably only get 1/3 the number of swabs in a package as you would with Q-tips, and I think the price is higher.  Johnsons REALLY wants to make sure you CAN'T stick a swab into your ear, that's for sure!  But I find that giant, misshapen swab head a little unwieldy from a &#34;standard&#34; swab.  I have gotten used to it, somewhat, but I'd still prefer a standard shape, and I'd certainly prefer to have 2 to 3 times more product for the price!  The ultimate would be to have an *organic* cotton swab since cotton is one of the crops that incurs the highest amount of pesticide spraying."
8996,1,"Refreshing with Amazing Results_I know this is shocking but&#8230;I have NEVER used a facial mask before! I know, I said it was shocking! I&#8217;m thirty eight years old and the Dead Sea Mud Mask was my first mask! Boy have I been missing out. I had no idea!I definitely need to take better care of my skin. I tend to take that for granted until I notice it looks bad. Since I recently had a baby and get very little sleep, I can see the effect it has on my skin. That&#8217;s when I start paying attention and taking better care of myself. I cleaned my face as usual and then applied the mask. From pictures I&#8217;d seen, I assumed this would be an entirely unpleasant experience. But I actually enjoyed the application itself. It felt cool and refreshing on my face and smelled almost minty. It gave me a tingly feeling that made my face feel so fresh and new.I showed it to my kids and they said I looked like a gorilla! It does have a greenish tint and I applied it thick enough to cover my entire face. After fifteen minutes when it was dry I washed it off with warm water. I touched my face to see if it felt any different and I was literally shocked at how soft it was! I didn&#8217;t know what to expect with the Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask but the application itself actually feels a little luxurious and the results are awesome!I feel like I went to a spa and it just took twenty minutes total in my own bathroom. It says to use once a week and I will definitely be adding this to my routine!"
4327,0,"Big brush_CoverGirl LashBlastFusion mascara says this is their biggest brush ever. That is where the problem came in with this mascara, not the applicator wand, but the brush itself is about twice the size of any other on a mascara wand I have seen. In order to use it on your lashes, especially the lower ones the brush itself is very hard to handle and not get mascara on your eyelid or skin under your eye. It took several applications because all of the brush does not seem to get close to the lashes themselves.The mascara itself clumped in small pieces - but that may have been because I resorted to another applicator - results - it just really doesn't work as well as promised."
6319,1,"Harmony cuticle oil._Loveeee this oil. Soaks in very quickly. I use it after my mani n pedi, I usually wait about 30 minutes or so after I'm done before adding this, to give my mani time to completely set n seal before adding. I also use nutra nail naturals nail growth serum every night at bed time. I love that it's not oily n will not lift my polish or gels if I use it everyday, which I do, smells great too. I only use harmony oil about 3 times a week if that, and it also smells great. I love it! It's wayyyy better than CND  solar oil and that oil has a not so good smell. Harmony cuticle oil n nutra nail naturals nail growth serum is the way to go in keeping your nail/cuticles moisturized n healthy looking."
5948,1,"Great makeup brushes_I am very pleased with these brushes. They are very full, soft and work perfect for my makeup. They are of good quality and I would recommend them to other ladies. There are alot of brushes in this set and there is a brush for every need."
9878,1,Five Stars_Worked pretty well. Not sure if anything could get rid of stretch marks 100%
3958,1,"Good OPI product_There are lots of holographic glitter and of course it goes on great.  My only complaint is that it is the base is more grey then silver.  In the sunlight, it is totally AWESOME."
4995,1,"5 Dollar Investment_Ace brand combs were the ones I grew up using on my hair (wavy, curly, frizzy depending on the weather). However, I couldn't find a 'shower comb' version. At LESS than FIVE BUCKS and free shipping this is a worthwhile investment for a hair tool for use both in and out of the shower.We'll spend a fortune on hair lotions & potions and complain about FIVE BUCKS for a decent hair tool. Yes it's plastic, it's hard, doesn't splinter to snag/break your hair. It helps evenly distribute your cleanser or conditioner product through your hair so the product can maximize it's benefit. I've used various Revlon shower combs before that quickly and easily shed their teeth and need continuous replacement. This has not been the case with this comb.A friend recommended getting the comb whether I purchased the WEN cleansing creme etc or not. I'm glad I did, I actually purchased TWO. One for the shower and one for my nightstand so I can detangle my hair after the nightly scalp massage rather than the finger combing I've been doing. Just know you're not going to find the same quality at the Dollar store or Wally-World, I've tried!"
9104,1,One was cracked/chipped_I love how these save space and make your collection easily viewable but one of the ones I received was cracked and chipped.
7795,1,Hair is thin_Quality of the clips and sewing is great! Strong but hair is thin. Not too crazy about the thin hair since I already have that problem naturally. Price was too good to be true.
4366,1,"Smells Amazing_My favorite scent from the Salvatore Incanto perfumes.  It smells so delicate and subtle, perfect for any season.  I always buy this scent."
4104,0,"Really? It isn't worth the hype_I got this gel eyeliner because I thought it would be an excellent and cheap buy compared to Mac's gel eyeliner, but I was disappointed. The formula is weird and I am currently using this as well as Loreal's Infallible gel eyeliner which feels a lot better on the eyes than this product does. I have to consistently apply the product in order to obtain that black, thick eyeliner. After a certain amount of applications, it starts to become cakey and bumpy. I do not have to do that with Loreal's version. I am applying it with my Sigma E11 brush (from the Performance Eye Kit) and it just smudges everywhere. I know many people swear by this product, but I think it is a crappy product. I will just stick to the Loreal version."
8672,1,"Ready to dye again! Use WITH same shampoo!!!!_Quick overview: Keratin is a protein that is present in our bodies (hair, teeth, nails) and is a big part of the strength in the cells to prevent breakage, rough surfaces and splitting.  It is a healthy protein that some of us do not have enough of in our system to make up for cell renewal.For me: my hair is past my shoulders, wavy, color-treated and frizzes with the levels of humidity where I live.  I'm not young (not older than dirt, either), so my cells replenish slower especially with needing to dye my hair on a monthly (or 6 week) basis to cover the grays so I don't scare away neighborhood children or get asked if I get a senior discount (hello! I'm only in my 30s!). I'm not rich, so a salon dye job is not always possible (and honestly, not always any better than the box stuff) and my hair ends up with some rough treatment in the name of vanity. I needed something that would keep my hair healthy so I could keep dying it when necessary without turning into a poorly groomed collie.I read about this shampoo and conditioner.  I liked using some types of Tresemme products in the past, so I thought I would give it a shot. I've been using both every day for about 10 days.After the first wash and 3-minute conditioning, my hair felt slightly smoother and had less snarls when I combed it.  Day 2, a bit better, still.  I lose a lot of strands whenever I pull my hair back and even more were coming loose from using the conditioner and following the 'comb through' part of the conditioner because I don't usually do that.  Day 3, still a bit better...By day 5, my hair felt continually smooth with no snarls when I got out of the shower.  I'd also started noticing that I was losing a bit less hair from the conditioner combing.I was able to use my ONLY hair product (a conditioning mousse) and my hair looked wonderful! The curls separated as though I had treated them individually, stayed smooth and curly the entire day and I had NO frizz issues.  I can't remember a day prior that my hair didn't frizz or fluff to some degree.  I've had the same results every day since.  In the future, I plan to see if I can use some shampoos in between or go back to my every-other-day washing regime, but right now I'm just enjoying the results.I recommend using BOTH shampoo and conditioner.  Do not think you will get the same result from using just one.  The shampoo seems to pull off all the daily guck that gets on your hair (squeaky clean, no joke rubber ducky!) and the conditioner is what really seems to heal your hair.  Both are absolutely needed.  This is not a mix and match kinda thing.  I know from the feel of both of them that they would not work the same if separated. Go with both or stay home with your head covered by a very large hat to cover the frizzy mess.  I'm not really a fan of hats, myself."
6624,1,"I love Dove_I'm still fairly young so I didn't expect a huge difference in my skin. Given that, I appreciate the smooth feeling I get when I step out of the shower. I almost don't need lotion. The lather is lovely and soft and also, the smell is great. Very fresh and light. I'm a Dove fan for life."
5639,1,"CAN NOT BEAT FOR THIS PRICE_ive gotten this wig in multiple colors, its comfy and so real looking i cant believe its so cheap. its my go to wig daily."
619,1,"So Glad I decided on this one!_Well I was not sure, thinking it would be too bulky and big and the reviews were not as fabulous as I expected....but I am thrilled with this dryer.  The warm and hot temps are spot on.  I have straight hair, but I have frizz within 20 minutes of doing my hair....not anymore.  This appliance is just what I needed and I love it so much I bought an appliance holder for my counter to keep it handy at all times!"
8106,1,"No sizzling skin!_Nice sunscreen with no beachy smell.  It caused a mild irritation on my face but I am sensitive to some of the ingredients listed - glycerin and parabens.  It worked really well on my arms and legs. The sunscreen actually protected my skin but it wasn't greasy at all -a problem I encounter with other brands.I have to say that the color is not really appealing it looks like a light creamy avocado color, but I guess that's the least of my concerns.  It absorbs quickly and leaves no residue, good for my arms and legs without the shinny skin or a sizzling effect under the sun."
4271,1,"great for kids and adults_Great foaming soap for kids and adults. It does't smell very strong like lavender, just a light scent. It really does moisturize my hands. Most soaps, even healthier ones, dry out my skin. This was just really a nice soap."
9273,1,I love the quality of their products and how your hair ..._I am a Fekkai fan and have been for years.  I love the quality of their products and how your hair looks and feels after shampooing.  This one has Argan oil and is vanilla scented.  It leaves your hair feeling silky.  A little bit goes a long way!
3445,1,"Really terrific!!_I love the Olay Pro-X line, and have been using it for about 2 years now. They work quite well and keep my skin moisturized. I absolutely love the Deep Wrinkle Cream!! It has a nice fragrance, and isn't greasy or oily. Some people mentioned breaking out when using the Olay Pro-X line, but I have not experienced that at all. It's a terrific kit!"
1540,0,never used it_I have very thick hair I saw such great reviews but It was so dainty and thin. It would be great for someone with thinner hair. But if you have thick hair best bet is to think about if you really want this item. I still have it but dont use it at all.
5,1,"An effective hand cream with a wonderful scent_This hand cream has one of the nicest fragrances I've ever come across and it seems to be one that everybody likes.  The cream is non greasy and absorbs quickly but leaves your hands feeling soft and moisturized.  This is the of those products I buy over and over again and have for several years.  It also makes a nice gift in a basket with a pair ofAngela's Garden 7120-921 Kids Garden Glove, Honey Bee, a hand gardening tool and a couple packets of seeds. The people I have given it to tell me that it's become one of their favorites too.  Everyone seems to like it's nice clean smell."
3384,1,"just what I was looking for_With 120 colors you'll hardly need anything else. The colors are very pigmented and bright, but if you're an olived toned (or medium) girl like me then you'll need primer for BETTER color payoff.The colors are exactly as you see them in the photos. My only concern was the packaging because, one of my eyeshadows arrived broken, maybe if the box was slightly smaller or if the product had more bubble wrap, or maybe even if there was a Fragile sticker on the box (not the product inside) then it wouldn't have broken. My palette arrived very fast, I ordered last friday afternoon and it arrived yesterday (tuesday) before the estimated time. It's not that unconfortable for traveling, but don't expect to take it with you in your purse. I would definitely recommend the product, I gave it 4 stars because of my broken eyeshadow."
6981,1,"Clean very well and smell great!_There are many cleansing cloths that do a terrible job of removing make up and which merely glide over the skin, not providing much in the way of deep cleansing.  The Biore cloths are far more substantial than the typical cleansing cloths, with a textured surface that provides a more complete cleansing.  A couple of quick swipes leaves my face makeup free and completely refreshed.  They also smell nice and not at all medicinal like some other brands."
5541,1,"The best of the black shatter/crackle polishes_Having used shatter or crackle polish by OPI, LaRosa and China Glaze, I have some basis for comparison.  They all work, it's your subjective taste that matters. The LaRosa shatter pattern is sort of a random pattern.  The China Glaze is more like a snakeskin shaped pattern.  In my opinion, the OPI is the nicest - it's clean and geometric, like tiny parallel rectangles.The OPI is easiest to work with too.  It's got a less gloppy or thick formula, so it goes on more cleanly, and shatters more intricately. It's a true black, nice and dark, covering any base coat well.  It's too bad OPI came out of the gate with the black and has been slow about other colors.  Fortunately other manufacturers have stepped more quickly into the blooming shatter market.If you haven't used a crackle or shatter polish, please read on.  These are a lot of fun, and look great.  It makes me crazy when I see reviews of disappointed people saying 'It didn't work' and you can usually tell they either didn't get directions with the product, or didn't read them.The point of crackle polish is to use two colors which contrast.  You apply a base coat of regular nail polish, and then paint the crackle polish on top, which shrinks as it dries to expose the base color.  Thus, whatever you choose for your base should be a color that will contrast nicely with the color of crackle you have.  The more different the colors (light and dark) the more obvious the pattern will be.Crackle polish will NOT work on your naked nail- as it dries it shrinks and it needs a smooth dry surface to shrink across.The key is to put the crackle polish on when the base color is COMPLETELY dry.  Then it will 'shatter' correctly.  It takes a few seconds or more for the crackle polish to work its magic and contract, so after putting it on, relax and watch it.  It's kind of like watching an old Poloroid develop.  If you find spots that are blank and you want to carefully fill them in afterwards, you can.Three things I have found regardless of the crackle or shatter brand:1) It is thick, so you really want to shake, stir and roll the bottle between your palms to get it well-mixed.2) Crackle polishes all dry matte (dull and un-shiney) so unless you like that look, you will want to apply some clear top coats to get shine and to level the layers.3) If you want small, fine crackles, go light with the crackle polish.  If you want a chunkier look with larger sections of crackle, go thicker.Good luck!"
2738,1,Great brushes!_These brushes are super soft and eco-friendly.  What's not to love?  They are a perfect additional to my makeup kit.
357,1,"Nice and natural + smells good!_Nice smell, majority organic and natural ingredients.  You only need a little to get a good lather and my hair feels clean and not STRIPPED of all oils.  I will purchase this again."
8253,1,"Tea Tree Oil + Free Tea Tree Oil Soap Bars_I bought the products for my granddaughter and although her skin hasn't cleared up yet, it does look better.  It has been three weeks since she started using it.  I'm hoping that with continued use, her skin will clear up completely"
5046,1,Wonderful and Mascara is Good Quality_The best mascara is the best on the market. I have tried ALL types it's doesn't run like the leading mascara on the market or drug store. You will be surprised but this item is cheaper to purchase with Amazon then a Mary Kay representive.
1786,1,Great for Dry Skin!_I received a Mary Kay gift basket with a bunch of different products and have enjoyed trying them all out. This moisturizer is fantastic. I tend to have a few dry patches and this is much better than using standard moisturizing lotions which can add excess oil and lead to breakouts. This gives me just the right amount of moisture without making my face feel greasy.
5933,1,Cute!_Oh Yeah! Now these are some nice lashes. Love Love Love Them. So pretty! I have purchased a few different kinds of lashes and I like these a lot. CUTE!
1011,1,"Dissolves EVERYTHING--but the *trick* is: don't use cotton balls, use it as a face wash_It's a gel cleanser that's crazily effective as an oil cleanser or creamy milky cleanser --but doesnt leave any residual. Rinses squeaky clean without tightness and nary a speck of makeup. No need for 'double cleansing'! the secret? The powerful, yet naturally-derived 'star ingredient' of Decyl Glucoside which dissolves everything in its path.The removal process is why i think people are rating this lower-- You have to do it THIS WAY: Emulsify gel all over wet face, massage, and you'll see your foundation, eye makeup, liquid liner, even mascara and oil-based lipstick break down into dirty brown rivulets (ewww). Rinse off, and that's it! Even my false lashes and lash glue come off with this product. No residual, no weird feeling of having to follow up with another cleanser.IF you are using this the 'old fashioned way' i.e. cotton ball, swiping product all over face, etc' then you will not see the product breakdown. This is the worst way to use this product! You MUST use it like a traditional face cleanser - wet face, massage, and rinse. Remember - NO cotton balls!I have always used milky/creamy/oil-based cleansers to breakdown makeup, followed by a foaming cleanser to emulsify and 'double clean'. there is no need for that extra step with this Earth Science product. I'm duly impressed."
3856,1,Adore_I luv and adore this color whenever I put it on. It's not to sparkling and it's not too dark either. I either use it for a highlighter or a light bronzer along the jawline.
4929,1,"I really love this lotion. Helps my dry chapped nurse hands.1_As a nurse, I am washing my hands constantly. I will leave work with very dry hands, and sometimes even cracking. I've tried several lotions and creams, but so far I am most pleased with this one. I am a big fan of Acure products in general. I love that their products are chemical free, are mostly organic, and seem to be effective for my skin. This product is no exception. I now have a bottle of this at work, and notice my hands will stay soft even after several washings. I make sure to apply again before leaving for home as I've noticed then my hands will be smooth and soft for the rest of the day. Oh, and the smell is amazing!! I have also tried the mandarin orange, and although I love that smell as well, I have greater fondness for the lemongrass."
2138,1,"Been a life saver after I damaged my hair from coloring_I dye my hair each month with a Feria permanent hair coloring. I have been doing this for years, and my hair is now quite long. My hair is also super thick, so I have to use 2 full boxes of hair coloring to cover all of my hair.Because of a handful of stubborn grey hairs, I left the hair dye in WAY too long the last time. The stated amount of time is 25 min, I figured I would leave it in for 40 min. I lost track of time and an hour later I am rushing to the shower to wash it out.Normally after dying my hair, it's even smoother and softer than before. This time is was terribly damaged at the ends and had a horrible texture to it when wet, that reminded me of when I had very damaged hair when I bleached it blond for years.I dug through my cabinet looking for some of my many hair products in an effort to find a leave in conditioner and I found this Herbal Essences Long Term Relationship Split End Protector that I had purchased a while ago and then forgot about. I started putting it on my hair each day after showering and it is the only thing making my now damaged hair ends manageable until I am able to find time to go to the salon for a hair cut.It works so well, it's almost as though I never damaged the hair at all. I am thrilled with the results and plan to keep using this since I love how well it is working."
8510,1,"Works really well_Ignore the 'manly' hype, this isn't some Axe silliness, this is a good dandruff shampoo. There's no obnoxious smell, just a fairly low key scent, and it gives your scalp a nice tingle to let you know it's working. It starts cutting down on the dandruff pretty much ASAP. Good product, good price on Amazon as an add-on."
3999,1,Great designs!_This plate is just what I wanted. I was looking for something with an Asian theme. I love it and it works great! I will purchase more Konad plates in the future.
5667,1,Great price and I can't find anything to complain about!_Great price and I can't find anything to complain about! I'm not very rough with manicure tools but these seem pretty sturdy. They also come in a convenient clear carry pack. No complaints here!
9300,1,"Veni, VIDI Vici_This is truly a delightful skin serum with a refreshing, although far from overpowering, citrus fragrance.  Love the feel of this on my face.  For reference, have had allergies and facial itching and hive like rashy patches, and even still this serum applied like a dream with zero irritation whatsoever.  In fact, over time - say a week - saw my red patches lightened and evened out.  And even though overall have good skin, could feel a difference in texture.  Many skin treatments are strictly cosmetic, meaning they mainly treat the surface, but this product made an actual difference in my complexion.  The one caveat though is, if you have very dry skin like me, you will still need to use a moisturizer.  This serum alone will not cut it, and your skin won't be properly prepped for makeup application.  As for anti-aging effect, cannot speak to that because do not have much wrinkling (yet that is).Onto the packaging.  Vidi Vitamin C20 Anti Aging Serum is a tall cylindrical column (1 oz.) which comes with an excellent dispenser that gives you the exact amount required.  No waste and the only way to hygenically dispense product.  Bottle has an upscale feel, and it's a product anyone would feel proud to display on their vanity.The labeling cautions that, being this product contains vitamin C, your skin will become more reactive in the sun, so you're going to need a sunscreen.  Personally, don't go out in the sun regularly, and do not wear sunscreen.  However, wearing a brimmed hat went out directly after applying this serum and felt no ill effects whatsoever.Full disclosure:  received a complementary sample in return for an honest review."
9502,1,"Same as other Suave kids shampoos, but a very light scent_The peach smell is much more subtle than many of their other scents.  We've used the Kids Suave products for years with all of our children.  They like them and we feel that they're pretty economical.  The peach smell of this one is very light, so keep that in mind.  I also like how the lids stay pretty tight on these bottles and won't leak if they knock them over.  However, they aren't water tight, so when they're dropped in a tub full of water, some will get in and dilute the shampoo."
4578,0,"Meh. I see no difference._This 'serum' is very watery. It is the consistency of... sugar water? Slightly thicker than water, but it is definitely not the consistency of what one might imagine a serum to be.Honestly, I think glycerine would prove to be a better/cheaper alternative to Hyaluronic Acid serums. I would love someone to prove me different, but I haven't seen any results for my dry skin even when I pair it with other moisturizers. Supposedly, this is supposed to 'grab' onto moisture, but I think it's BS. However, I try to remember that all skin types vary!"
4170,1,"Jergens Ultra Healing Lotion, 32 Ounce_Jergens Ultra Healing Lotion, 32 Ounce, very satisfied with this item. It exactly what it said it would be. Love it!"
8558,1,Oily_I have not really had a chance to try it yet. I did use a little when I first got it and it left my skin feeling oily.
9379,1,"Love it_It worked for me it's a month today since I've been using it, and my spot has lighten a lot. I wish it wasn't almost $50 a bottle because I sure need another bottle! Just try it!"
9415,1,"Great product!_This product has helped even out my skin tone, decrease blemishes and soften my skin. Belitae's vitamin C serum is one that absolutely provides real results without drying out or breaking out your skin. I actively look for products to help certain areas of my skin, as I tend to suffer from a few different things. Overall, this product definitely improved my skin tone, as well as being very gentle on skin. My skin has dramatically improved and I am happy with the long range results. For anyone seeking out great new products, such as the natural vitamin c facial serums, this is one I would, without question recommend this."
6949,1,"love it_I personally LOVE these lip butters, and after buying a few of the more natural shades, I finally bought this one. I wanted it so badly but I was afraid that it would look weird on me because I am VERY pale. Fortunately, it actually looks really nice, so if that's what's stopping you from purchasing it, I say go for it! It's pretty cheap for the quality that you're getting. What I like most about these lip butters is that you can apply them lightly for sheer color or really rub 'em on and get a lot of color. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a low priced, moisturizing, and versatile lip product."
3807,1,"Love All Of These_I have waist length hair so hair ties are a big part of my life.  I have purchased this brand in many colors, I reviewedB0045H854Wearlier and I'll say it again here.  These are great, hold their shape, have no metal and I have tried to 'seed' my life so there is always one or two around"
32,1,Best face cleanser I've ever used._I've been using this for years.  Very mild for sensitive skin.  Good for rosacea. Oil-free.  Leaves my skin very soft.  I found Cetaphil irritating but this never is.  It doesn't irritate eyes either.  I expect to buy this forever!
1875,1,Dulce & Gabbana_Great perfume for women. I bought this as a gift to my stepsister a few years back and she loves it. Now I don't know why I spent money on her. Because her mother is a whore and so is she and they all grew up in a ghetto a$$ village.
7303,1,"LOVE this shampoo_Dandruff shampoo isn't usually very girly. My teen daughter and I both have dry scalp and/or dandruff. She puts the fragrance and how it makes her hair feel over it actually working to keep her scalp flake free or her hair clean.  She hasn't tried this yet, but I have been using it a couple weeks, and I LOVE it.In addition to the great fragrance, my hair feels very clean and seems to stay clean a day longer. I'm going to try out the conditioner as well. I'm totally sold."
6821,1,worsk great_Love it it works great all the images work and it works with different polish not only konad which is great
4908,1,"This product is the worse!_This product made my hair extremely dry! I have an afro and it just made it drier!! I am immediately rinsing this out and trying something else in a couple of days, along with a protein treatment to restore moisture!! I will never use this product again. Thanks but no thanks!"
485,1,"Saved my skin_I discovered this product about one year ago. I have oily, acne prone,and large pores. I tried everything from proactiv to other expensive acne products. Thankfully I came accross these pads and I haven't stopped using them ever since."
9685,1,Love!!!_I have very thin hair and it looks dry and damaged. This shampoo instantly gave my hair a noticeable amount of volume and also makes it so much healthier. My hair feels light and clean! The shampoo is more like a gel so I only use a tiny bit and it lathers well. The smell isn't so great but it does what it says it does!!
7361,1,Recommend for curly hair_I like to use this hair spray on my curly hair.  I don't think it has quite the holding power as high-end &#34;non-curly&#34; brands but it works well here in AZ with its low humidity.
8649,0,"No good for Brunettes_Does not rub into hair well, not worth it, especially on brunette hair.  An added negative is how messy it is and will get on your skin, this is only for little girls playing ."
7013,1,"First liquid eyeliner_I've never had any luck with liquid, and seeing as how I am not very coordinated, I stuck to gel and an angled brush. Problem with gel is it smudges. My first time applying liquid eyeliner is with this product, and I think I've converted. It gets a nice dark line above my lashes and does not budge until I need to remove makeup and wash my face. Bottom lashes I don't like done too much so I stick with a light pencil liner."
1577,1,"Great Price, Fantastic Results ... And It's PINK!_Good grief. Is there another hairdryer on the market? (As though it isn't weird enough that there are entire aisles of hairdryers/straighteners/stylers). This is just what we need, right? Well, the Conair Infiniti is actually worth a second-look (even if it's just for it's peculiar color). Here is everything you need to know:Pros:1.) It's cute! It's pink! It's fairly compact!! (So sick of those black, INSANELY bulky, dryers!!)2.) It's not unbearably heavy! (i.e. I could actually complete drying my hair without shaking/clinching my arm in pain!)3.) Ergonomic! (i.e. it nicely fits in one's hand).4.) Affordable! (I've paid more than triple for a tourmaline dryer!!)4.) Retractable cord!! (By far, the most appealing factor!! Cuts-down on the bathroom clutter ... and, as a neat-freak, I REALLY love this!)Cons:1.) It's pink ... not just 'pink' ... but SUPER pink!! (Maybe this won't appeal to some folks!)Hey, if you need a hairdryer and you dig pink (and being UBER-TIDY!), this is your guy!! Highly recommended!"
7778,1,Prepare for compliments!_These little bows are absolutely adorable. They are the only ones I've seen that had the tails of the ribbon showing and I really like how that looks on my nails.
2991,1,"Love it! Just needs a bit of help._I LOVE this stuff. I got really into mineral make up after getting a set of it for Christmas. I have bad acne, scars and some spots that don't want to go away. They are fading with the use of different products, but until they're done going away, which I'm sure they will, I need good coverage. This stuff is great. I first got it as a show make up, for plays I did. So I got it darker than normal. I liked it because it was smooth to apply dried on with great coverage, but you CAN'T leave it on by itself, it rubs off very easily even after drying. What you need to do is put it on, you can use smaller dabs as concealer or use a actual concealer, I do both, depending. Most of the time, I can use just a little extra of the foundation to cover a spot, other times I use Neutrogena Healthy skin concealer. When this product wasn't available in stores anymore, I went to their Healthy Skin line. It is close, but not the coverage I'd like. This stuff is perfect. You just need a little help. Like I said, if you have spots like me, a concealer would be helpful. I haven't tried the mineral one that goes with Maybelline's mineral line, but I think I will. What I do is put on the foundation with my fingers or a foundation brush. I give it a second to try. While I get out my bronzer and blush type thing. Then I put on Maybelline's shine free loose powder in light to help it set. Then I put on my other face make up and then apply the powder again. It looks a little odd for about ten minutes, but once it sets in, it's AMAZING. It's perfect. Like I said, I have acne problems and scars, hides it all and doesn't bother me with more acne. It stays all day, worn it from a early morning rehearsal to he end of a show at midnight. So it stays on a LONG time. Even with reapply stage make-up. Great product. Wish I could find it in stores."
7559,1,"Very shiny, but not chrome._This polish is very shiny, but is not mirror like. I was searching for a good chrome or mirror like polish and this one kept coming up in searches on Pinterest. I saw some video reviews on YouTube about it decided to try. It is a very pretty silver , but is not a mirror finish. I will use it, it just is not as shiny as I was going for."
1071,1,"The BEST!_If you want an excellent night cream, then, look no farther. To me this is the best one ever, ...it balances out your skin, hydrates, not greasy, absorbs, and the list goes on and on. Truly a wonderful product."
6751,0,"Delivered totally wrong item with very poor customer service_They sent me the totally wrong order. I double checked three times and this palette with eyeshadow colors is what is in my order but instead, I received a palette of red and orange blush-colors! I have not heard anything back from the seller. I will not purchase again from them. Definitely not worth the time, the mistake and the lack of service."
1157,1,Great stuff_This is the old Nivea lotion that used to come in a glass bottle.  Very soothing and feels nice on the skin.  Great product.
8578,1,Great Value_This deal can't be beat.  Nail glue is so expensive in the stores and buying in lots of 10 is a great way to ensure to never run out of it!
7002,1,Pretty white tips_The package came in earlier than expected (always a good thing) and all sizes were individually bagged and numbered. Pretty excited to try these out. ;)
2603,1,"one of my staples_I am a pj which is a product junkie so I have just about tried everything in the book,and very choosy what I like and don't like but when I came across this olive oil replenishing paks I fell in love with this stuff and it became a staple for me very good conditioner and does the hair very well."
8001,1,"It works_The only negative thing that I can say about this is that the hose is a bit particular about how it has to be attached into the hood to stay in.  There could be more room for hood storage but it will fit in the space available.  A compact, easy to carry and use hair dryer for those of us who still roll our hair the old fashion way."
4499,1,"Wonderful_Oh man this is a great product. I have used this for quite a while and will continue. I've used COUNTLESS faux tanning products and this is the BEST BY FAR! No orangy streaky horribleness. You will look like a beautiful lady, not an oompa loompa."
8663,1,"Works...not much smell_My husband has been using this for about a month.  He likes it a lot, it keeps him from sweating and more importantly it doesn't quit working for him to start smelling.  There is very little smell to the antiperspirant itself, so if you like the low-smell toiletry items, this is for you."
9678,1,"Love it_Their packaging is pretty nice.When I open it, first comes to my mind that, it's a &#34;ORANGE JUICE&#34;!?? Hahaha,it is not only looks like orange juice, but also smell like it! So weird! It's kinda sticky which I really dislike sometimes. i beleive it's great for all skin type and I prefer to use it at night and ofcourse in Spring/Summer time. It absorbs well.I am not sure if I am going to repurchase it again!Got this free to review"
1741,1,"Opi Vodka & Caviar_This is the most absolutely perfect red nail polish that I have ever tried in my life. It is not too warm toned nor cool toned. The perfect red polish, I would definitely recommend on Medium to Tan skin, not to sure for extremely pale/light skin people nor extremely dark. but nonetheless the best red I've ever tried."
9913,1,HUB LIKES IT_Not too greasy.  He uses it after shaving. Helps control his dry skin. He is using it so he must think it is working well.. You know men.
2042,1,"Excellent moisturizer that isn't too heavy_I haven't had any peels on my skin, but in the winter my skin can get dry and flaky in certain areas as a result of the anti-acne products I use. I've been using theLa Roche-Posay Toleriane Fluid  1.35-Ouncesas my regular moisturizer, and overall it works well. However, certain areas of my skin were sometimes still very dry and flaky.After reading the reviews I ordered this moisturizer and so far I've really been pleased. It has a gel-like consistency, and you really don't need much. It's very light and quickly absorbs into my skin. Most importantly, it's helped soothe my flaky skin, making it smooth again without causing me to break out.Lastly, the seller did a really great job. Right after I placed my order, they sent me an email to let me know that since they are located in Europe the delivery time might take a bit longer than usual. Luckily the product arrived on time and in good condition."
5301,1,"Great product_I love Neutrogena products and this was no exception!!  Cream goes on smoothly and feels great on my skin.  My skin has been more luminous. Can't really say yet if my wrinkles are diminishing, but skin does look better.  I have only been using for a week!  I really like it!!!"
6231,1,"Good basic eyeliner_I like this a lot better than eye pencils that needs sharpening, and it's a nice deep black. It's a little soft, though (and I keep my house at 65 degrees). That makes putting it on without smudgy gobs a bit tricky. Maybe I just prefer a slightly firmer eye pencil than most people."
1308,1,Awesome Dryer!_Since I have short hair I was looking for something that would style my hair and also dry it at the same time. I love this. It take me no more than 5-7 minutes in the morning it gives you volume like you would not believe as well. Plus the price is right! The comb on it is small about two and a half inches so if you have a lot of hair or if you have long hair it would still work only it will take you longer to do. But for me it's perfect.
447,1,"Excellent._Does the trick, and I trust the brand.  I wish it had a push-open spout for drops but not a real minus."
905,1,"Prodct does work BUT it is tinted_I bought this product first, before getting the Olay ProX eye lifting serum.  While this product dis work for me, as well as the Pro-X product, this one is tinted.  I prefer a non tinted cream because I want the product to actually work and restore my skins natural color.So while this product does work in reducing puffiness below my eyes and reduce dark circles it also covered them up with a tint.  For around the same money, I recommend the Olay Pro-X eye serum since it works just as well and is a white cream which the skin absorbs very well.  IF you do want a tinted cream to help conceal though, this product does work quite well.  I hope this helps people :-)"
9171,1,Must have_This is a must have product if you are a nail stamper in enthusiast like me... It holds all my plates
5319,1,"No stickiness_Dont need to apply much and after a minute, you wouldnt even know you have it on, and it was very protective.  Love the small size as you can carry it with ease and reapply when ever you need to.  And you don't waste it as a tub is about the right size per person for a 6 days beach trip!"
6471,1,"Good wipes, but a bit too rough_I have enjoyed using these wipes, but I do have to say that they are a bit too rough for my skin. I know that they are meant to be exfoliating (which they are), but I would discourage anyone with sensitive skin from using them as they are just a bit too rough. Apart from that, they work just fine. My make up comes right off."
9507,1,"Peachy!_I am a big fan of anything that will get my kids a least a little bit excited to shower. This 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner does the trick. They love that instead of having to do two steps to clean their hair they only need to do one. Conditioning is a must for both my daughters, they both have thick wavy hair. This shampoo/conditioner leaves their hair shiny, soft, and smelling peachy clean!"
6449,1,"very moisturizing!_This mask is very moisturizing, there is plenty of product in each treatment to use all over the neck and chest as well.  I keep the mask in its' envelope and re-use as the mask is very saturated with the moisturizing ingredients.  rub the extract into your skin and skin is soft and silky, I especially appreciate how soft it leaves my neck and chest area.  very good value!"
4053,1,"LOVE!!!_I love this mascara soo much! I curl my lashes, apply the base coat (1) then apply the 24hour hold (2) & presto! You have beautifully full lashes! I can go throughout the whole day without it smudging & no clumps! Best mascara I've used by far! Never run out please!!!"
4797,1,Christmas Gift_I gave a Remington Ceramic Curling Iron to my future daughter-in-law as one of her Christmas gifts.  Julie said she loves the curling iron since it curls her hair quickly without burning the hair strands.
9637,1,"Great product_Foxbrim Argan Oil really did do wonders for my hair. I have been using Foxbrim 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil in my hair for awhile now and love the way it feels. It can leaves my hair so soft and shiny. It tames my frizzes and makes my dry hair look healthy and beautiful. I don't know you, but my hair has been colored for so many years and it started to look dead and hopeless I have tried so many different things for my hair If you have really frizzy hair or even just dry hair like I do, this will work wonders on your hair. I applied it after I got out of  the shower I just worked it all over my hair. It will make your hair shinny and it tames the frizzies. Works wonders on your nails and hands also."
170,0,"I don't like this!_I was trying to replace a peel off mask I had in college over 10 yrs ago but couldn't remember the name; it left my face soft and it was easy to peel off and it didnt have a strong smell, but this product is the opposite. This product is messy to apply and thick, and it takes a long time to dry and I don't see a difference in my face when I take it off. I left it in the draw with all the other products I don't really use because they do nothing special. I mean really!!!"
1969,1,"great stuff_great stuff, just as mentioned in all the other reviews.really cleans out pores."
6314,1,Love this color!_I love this color! It looks like a mermaids tail.  Beautiful and sparkly.  It goes on smoothly and stays on well
3343,1,"Suave Kids 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner, Cowabunga Coconut_not only does this work well with very little but the grandkids love the smell of it and love bathing when at Grandmas because of it. It rinses out very well and only needs to be left on for about a minute so I do their hair first and then rinse it out after they've washed their body. nice to just need one bottle in the bath tub shelf."
4473,1,"Excellent for Makeup Removal_I've been using this for two weeks now nightly if I have worn makeup, and it's great. My mascara, eyeliner, eye shadow, BB cream, blush, lipstick dissolve off of my skin and leave it clean but not dry.This is actually my second favourite makeup remover, my first choice being Shu Umera's Pore Clarifying Cleansing Oil (my mother uses it to remove her makeup, and she's almost 50 and looks nowhere near her age. Aside from good genes and a few other tricks, I'm pretty sure that using the cleansing oil has helped), but it's a little too expensive for my budget right now as a student in uni.This product is a good investment for those with sensitive skin and who know how to ration the solution. I've already recommended it to a few of my friends."
3162,1,olay regenerist regenerating cream cleanser_I have used this for a long time  it is a great product and leaves you face clean and soft  I would recommended this product to everyone  and I am sure they will love it also
6539,1,O yeah!_When I got this product I was excited like a kid on Christmas Day all those colors my goodness I will not have to buy anymore eyeshadows maybe if I run out lol so ladies if I was you get this product I don't care what you wear you can match anything you wear with this product so hey it's time to take a chance buy this item or purshase more colors you won't go wrong with this
8621,1,"Soft and Manageable_I liked this conditioner.  It has a light scent and doesn't leave any residue when you rinse it off.  I have curly thick hair, so it's hard to find a conditioner that will soften my hair without weighing it down.  This conditioner was nice, because it left my hair soft and manageable without weighing down my natural curls."
9862,1,organic and trusted brand_What can I say my hair is softer and alive again . plus my face has it's glow again. Totally love this product. It's pure and organic.i know that I can trust this product because I bought from This company before
9481,1,Gentle Yet Get the Job Done_These brushes are great; they do the job of untangling and managing hair without being harsh. The bristles are a little more giving than other brushes I've used and the ball point ends protect your head.The smaller size is great for travel or your purse and the larger one can stay home.
4145,1,"Fav Peach Color_My fav color. I was receiving so much compliments from nail tech.  Other customer was asking for my color, I was like no buy your own. Its amazing for spring and summer colors."
218,1,Great hand soap_The lavender version smells good.  It feels good when washing hands.  It's not harsh on hands.  I would recommend it.
8327,1,"Smells good_I used this on my daughter's hair, and asked her how she would describe the smell (she is six).  She said it is a little soapy smelling, a little like pears, and a little like paradise....It's a mild gel with minimal hold.  It says it is alcohol free and is cool ocean blast scented (maybe that's where the paradise smell comes from?)  It gave her mild hold (she has a short pixie, so we just used it for highlighting a few strands of hair).  It seems like a good product.  She is happy with the smell, and happy it doesn't feel like her hair is glued to her head (her biggest complaint with gels or sprays)."
9195,1,"It's okay but it's not perfect._I'm a little confused about the 10-in-1 bit here but this is a decent enough mascara. The  brush is a bit strange and twisted but I just use it like a regular wand and wiggle it at the base of the lashes and work it through to the tips. One to two coats is really all I need and my lashes are nicely coated, look thicker and longer and slightly curled without the help of a lash curler. So that's really a 3-in-1, isn't it? I must be missing something, 7 somethings  . . . The only negative here is that it smudges on to my brow bone which is embarrassing when I look in the mirror hours later and realize I have black smudges under my brows. I have oily lids so that may be the problem but for this kind of money I was hoping it would at least stay put better than some of the drugstore mascaras I've tried (all of which do the same thing)."
6775,1,"Nice quality, comfortable to use_After years of using an orange stick and finally realizing it was putting ridges in my nails, I am hoping this tool will care for my cuticles and do away with the damaging ridges.  The curved edge is not at all sharp on the one I received and feels comfortable pushing the cuticle.  I like the quality of the stainless steel and I'm sure it will last forever. Not exactly sure of the intended use for the pointed end but I can say it works well for cleaning up nail polish that gets on your skin at the edges of your nails. I've been using this tool with a cuticle cream for a week now and I'm loving it. For the few dollars it costs, this is a must-have."
727,1,"Holy Grail!_I have worked in high-end cosmetics for ten years.  I have tried the most expensive, I have tried the cheapest, I have tried everything in between!  This is it.  Stop wasting money.  The color range of this product is amazing and the ingredients are top-notch.  The coverage is the best there is and the greatest part is that you don't have to buff and grind this into your skin.  It smoothes on with a medium sized powder brush.  It even lasts longer than one can of Bare Minerals.  Forget your concealer, you don't need it.  If you are super dry, use a moisturizer and maybe a setting mist.  If you are oily, MUFE HD powder on your Tzone afterward.  ALWAYS use a primer.  Follow those tips and you'll be set."
9973,1,"A brand I like and trust!_I used the Adovia Mineral Lift Serum for a few days, and I like how smooth my face is after using it. I have a somewhat sensitive skin, so many of the moisturizers and face creams turn my face red right after applying them to my face. The Adovia Mineral Lift Serum, has not done that, so it really got my trust. I  It has a pleasant mild fragrance, and a little amount goes a long way. It absorbs quickly, and doesn't leave your face feeling greasy. I look forward to the long term results it says it have."
5327,1,"Good Scent, Good Product for Kids and Adults_I love this detangler spray for both my daughter and myself. It has a light fruity scent that you smell when you spray on but doesn't leave you in a cloud. I use it on my daughter who has very long (past her bottom), very curly hair. Her hair is soft, but thick, and gets tangles particularly at the end. We use the detangler spray after we wash her hair to keep some moisture in it. We also use it on her dry hair because otherwise, there'd be no way to get a comb through it without breaking it off. We've used both this swirlberry scent and the apple scent. Both are nice, but this is the one both she and I prefer.I use this on my own hair, as well. My hair is thick and very curly and generally a huge mess in the mornings. This detangler makes it a lot easier to get a comb through it. It's way cheaper than the adult products that are out there, and I prefer the scent. I like to use it when I wear my hair down--it gives my hair some control without any heaviness."
5495,1,"conair spining brush_Great hot air spinning brush I absolutely love it, I'm happy that I purchased this, this is a must have."
8844,1,Very pretty_I ordered these just for something different and dressy. Very pretty and seem very well made...and they do not slip in my hair. Shipping seemed to take awhile but I think they came from out of the country so it was fine. Well packaged on arrival.
5961,1,Good lotion_This was a really good tanning lotion back when I used to tan. Pleasant smell and a decent bronzer. I would recommend.
6086,1,Love this!_I actually bought this train case for my friend who also does makeup. She just loves this so much she said it was perfect for all her supplies and I looking to purchase one in the near future!
1159,1,"Does a great job at moisturing!_I've used this product for over a year now, and find it to be very effective at maintaining the moisture level of my fifty-something skin. Now that I've found it on Amazon subscribe and save I can have it delivered at a better price! Thanks Amazon!"
3726,0,Make your hair dirty_My eight year old has some curl to her hair I was hoping this would help her hair bring the curl back but all it did was make it seem dirty and weighed down. I didn't mind the smell but even when I used just a bit it didn't work.
7742,1,"Truly a miracle_This is by far the best product I have used on my fine, highlighted hair. My hair is in better shape with less breakage and getting healthier each day. Soft, full of volume, and so shiny!"
7816,0,Bad masque_Very heavy with oils. Made my hair tangly and super dry. I need to use a clarifying shampoo to get this product off. It blocks moisture from getting into my hair. I used it twice with different shampoos to see if that made a difference. I threw it away because it was actually damaging my hair by making it hard to brush. If you like the Shea Moisture masque you'll love this because it's slightly better. Very disappointed.
2297,1,It leaked!!!_It leaks so I would be very careful with this product make sure its standing up right ( standing like in the pic of it when you store it ) and not laying on its side or it will leak and I would say to expect it to have leaked when you received it but its half the price than the stores so yeah I'm grateful!
7143,1,"Makes your curls light, shiny and defined_I have some curly hair and the only way to make it look neat is to use some kind of natural oil which will make it look very greasy.  But this product has all the good things of a natural oil without making it too greasy.Used this and found this to be very helpful to keep my curls - shiny and nice"
4637,1,"Just a touch of red..._I'm very fair and don't look good in red lipstick however I was just in a wedding and needed red lips to coordinate with my dress, etc.  This a nice transparent stain that is definitely red without being overpowering.  It can be layered for a darker, more dramatic look.  I have several other colors from Revlon's Just Bitten line.  The color lasts for hours and the pen itself doesn't run out as quickly as other stains I've tried.  The gloss is easy to break off if you aren't careful when removing/replacing cap and during application.  Overall, RJB is my favorite lipstain and this color worked perfectly for me."
4607,1,nice set_This set came with a nice array of colors. The stones are very nice and show great when they hit the light. It came in a nice pin wheel. Not only did I find this great for nails but the stones are also great for personalizing things with. All of the colors that came in this wheel was lovely. They are easy to use and set on to nails. I was very happy with how long the lasted after being applied to the nails. They are the perfect size for nail art.
4840,1,Girlie sparkly pink_I love this color! One coat is perfect for a French manicure. Two coats is a cute girlie sparkly pink.
7144,1,"Why I Love This More Than Pure Coconut Oil_I stopped coloring my hair a little over a year ago (I had no idea what my natural color was - guess what...it's brown!). I know this is marketed for black women, however, I think every women could probably benefit from it.When I used to highlight my hair - I tried all sorts of conditioners to make it soft - from expensive to cheap - and found what worked best was simply coconut oil. Slept with it on my hair overnight and washed it out in the morning about twice a month.While it's great - it is difficult to put on (you have to melt it and on more than one occasion I almost burnt my scalp b/c I didn't wait long enough for it too cool - but if you wait too long, it gets hard again!).I noticed this has coconut oil in it and so decided to try it.I LOVE IT.Seriously...right now it's selling for 6.00 - it's a freaking bargain.I didn't have to leave it on all night like I did when I used pure coconut oil , but I did leave it on for about 5 minutes. After one treatment, my hair was noticeably softer (and smelled awesome! But not like coconuts!)I have medium thick hair that seems to be getting brittle as I age despite the fact I haven't highlighted for over a year - so this is a Godsend.Love it and highly recommend for all hair types (well, except greasy, I guess!)."
2019,1,Gorgeous._Classic beautiful color. Revlon makes great lip product. This is probably one of my favorite colors they offer. Highly recommend it. Perfect for winter
4981,1,everyday use!_This brush I go to for my everyday foundation routine! I LOVE IT! I highly recommend you trying this brush the price is unmatched for such good quality it is!
6202,1,Verdict is still out_Purchased to use in my natural hair read about its medicinal qualities. Have not used yet so verdict is still out
6890,1,"Great for sensitive skin_We have two in our house who have particularly sensitive skin and are very limited as to which products they can use on their skin.  This product works well for both of them.  One has skin that gets very dry and red and irritated and one who finds that many facial cleansers sting, neither had any trouble with this product.  It is very light and watery so if you're looking for a scrub, this isn't it.  But it leaves the skin feeling good and clean."
4283,1,raw Shea butter_The raw Shea butter restorative line works really well on my hair. It leaves my hair feeling strong and soft!
2593,1,A big Fan_I dont usually wear cologne but my wife made me get this and it smells wicked. Came at a good price.
476,1,"Perfect!_My hair is fine and straight, but it still tangles easily. I use this after drying my hair after a shower and it doesn't snag at all. My hair doesn't get static-y from using this, which I love. 5 stars."
6121,1,"great rhinestones, but not quite 2400 pieces_Just received the rhinestones in the mail, and was able to use it with my gel polish manicure.  The sizes are perfect for me.  I prefer them small instead of big and gaudy.  The colors are nice too.  However, I don't think there's actually 2400 pieces.  For it to be 2400 pieces, each color would have about 200 pieces.  I'm pretty sure there's not 200 pieces of each color, maybe 100 or so?  So this product lost 1 star for that.  Overall, it's still a great product especially for the price."
1963,1,EXCELLENT!!_This is a great product. It does get the skin very clean. You can feel it 'pulsating' as some has described when it has been on your face for about 15-20 minutes.
8523,1,"Protect Your Hair Against Heat Damage_Since I heat style my hair almost every day (blow dryer, flat iron, spiral curling iron--sometimes all three in one day), it's important for me to use products to protect against the heat damage. Over the last few months, I've been self-conscious about my swoop bangs because they look more fried than any other section of my hair. I'd run out of my heat styling spray, and I'm regretting that I did not purchase replacement for it sooner. Prior to learning aboutTresemme Platinum Strength Heat Protect Spray, 8 Ounce, I had been usingTRESemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Protective Spray 8 fl oz (236 ml). I'm a little confused on what the difference is between the two products, because they both do the same thing: protect hair against heat damage.The Tresemme brand is one I trust, and this heat spray is much cheaper than salon brands. I am very generous in application of this heat spray; I spray it on before I blow dry and then again before I either flat iron or use my spiral curling iron. I have purchased salon brands before, and some of them have cost almost $20 per bottle. I tend to run out of this type of spray quickly, so I like having the less expensive option which works just as well as the salon brands.The Tresemme Heat Protect Spray has a pleasant smell which reminds me of products used in my preferred salon. It does leave my hair feeling a bit weighted and slightly sticky, so I often opt out of using hairspray after I'm done with styling.Although it says you will get best results by using withTresemme Platinum Strength Shampoo, 25 OunceandTresemme Platinum Strength Conditioner, 25 Ounce, I think it works just fine with other shampoos and conditioners. I've never used any of the Tresemme heat protectants with the same shampoos and conditioners, and have found the product always delivers what it promises: shine, no frizz, and reduced damage."
7295,1,"Works great!_I ordered this for my son who has struggled with dandruff since he entered his teens. Other shampoos have helped some but none as much as this one. Not only does the shampoo smell and clean well it also helps fight his dandruff problem, making him a more confident young man. I love this shampoo and will continue to purchase it for him."
3353,1,"Mens Nautica Classic EDT_This smells so fresh and clean.  It's been a perennial favorite of mine for years...any man that loves to smell great without his scent entering a room 30 seconds before he does, will love wearing this."
1689,1,Awesome stuff_I love the way that it makes my hair very shiny and takes away the frizzes.  Makes my hair soft as smells good.  Also for the price of about $11 it is much  cheaper that the $75 at the mall
2646,1,Staying Power_Well let me just say that this lipstick will STAY with you throughout most of the day so be prepared.  I had to use vaseline to get the lipstick off at the end of the day.  This particular is quite lovely and it still lasts longer and keeps lips a bit moister than any other long wearing lipstick that I've found.
4786,0,Clipless curling iron_I dont have the patience to figure this out. It looks easier to maneuver than it actually is. My hair stylist even hated it. great idea horrible execution
4240,1,"Love it!_My mom has sworn by Dove since I was a kid. After hearing much praise from my dermatologist, I joined the cult and started to purchase Dove as well. I have very sensitive skin and many soaps irritate it. This is by far my favorite Dove soap due to the fact that it smells pleasant and makes my skin feel soft and clean without irritation."
6936,1,"Cheeky is a Name You Can Trust!!!_Cheeky! I always love my stuff ordered from Cheeky! Great Deals, great products."
3155,1,Great for muscle ache_I bought this muscle relief lotion because I was sitting in front of an air condition and the cold air seep into my back. When I woken  up the next morning I could barely lift my right arm because my back was in so much pain. I rubbed the muscle relief on my back for 3 days straight and the pain was gone completely. This stuff really works and made me feel really good. The smell is OK but it does smell a little bit like Bengay. I highly recommend this product and will purchase more in the furture.
5123,0,"just o.k._i think it was to expensive for the quality of hair that was provided. it wasn't human hair, and it was rather thin piece of hair. So, if you don't have naturally thick hair, i wouldn't purchase the piece.. It didn't blend in well for me at all."
1768,1,"One of My Faves_4.5 StarsI've been wanting to try this foundation for awhile now and finally got around to purchasing it.  For this product line you pretty much have to know what shade you are because 1) the color selection is very limited compared to other foundations and 2) it's almost impossible to gauge the color of the foundation because the product is packaged so that you can't really see inside it.  However if you know your shade or are pretty sure of it, then you shouldn't have a problem.  I have fair skin with light hair and eyes and purchased classic ivory (the lightest shade) and it's a near perfect match.  I was a little dismayed when I opened the foundation, though, because the product was so dark!  But once I applied it to my face it blended smoothly and lightened.  I think the mousse texture is what makes the product look darker in the container than it really is.  As long as you picked your right shade, then it should look natural on your skin, no matter how it looks in the jar.I love how this goes onto your face.  Instantly my skin looked airbrushed and my imperfections were covered.  I have large pores on my cheeks and those were minimized almost to the point of invisibility.  I also have acne marks on my cheeks which were practically eliminated with this foundation.  It's super blendable and feels so soft and lightweight on your face, giving you amazing coverage without feeling like you're wearing a lot of product.  My skin is super oily but this product keeps shine and grease at bay for most of the day.  It is also a true color and will not oxidize.There is one minor negative thing but I'm learning to work with it.  Because of its whipped texture, the foundation can sometimes form balls or clumps as you apply it to your face.  It smooths out, of course, but sometimes it will fall off of my fingers as I'm applying it or as I'm bringing my fingers to my face to apply, resulting in product on the floor, counter top, my shirt, or whatever else it falls on.  However, I'm trying out different application techniques to prevent this from happening and I seem to be getting better at mastering it.  I think once you are used to the texture of this foundation it won't be a problem.  Another negative thing: this is not for people with dry skin.  I will sometimes have dry patches around my chin and this product magnifies them; then my skin looks cakey.  A good moisturizer counteracts this to some degree, but it still looks odd and my dry skin is emphasized somewhat.Bottom line: I would recommend this to people with oily (and maybe normal) skin; dry skin people be wary.  It feels so silky on my face and gives me an instant airbrush finish.  It controls shine for most of the day and doesn't oxidize.  It's slightly cheaper in stores (depending on where you buy) and if you're looking for a new foundation this should definitely not be passed up."
738,1,Perfect for travel_Power of a big hair dryer without the bulk.  It is lighter and easier to use that a standard dryer. I am now using it at home as well as for travel.
1306,1,"It;s not a lotion, it's a creme_By far this has the best ingredients of anything I have used and I am sure over time it is great for your skin but the packaging is wrong.  It is more like a very fluffy creme and needs to be in a jar.  I am 64 and exercise every day and am at least a little strong for my age.  It is so thick and creamy that it does not flow out of the bottle.  It takes a lot of pushing and working with the thick cream in the bottle.  If it were packaged in a jar I would give it 5 starsI have been trying to deal with the thickness of this lotion.  I read a review of this product on another site that said she added a little water to get it to come out easier.  I did and I am now raising my review to 5 stars"
9939,1,"The best I've ever used_I tried this product in exchange for a review on my blog.I really enjoyed the conditioner and it helped add volume and moisture to my hair. So, why the four stars? The price is steep for a hair product, in my opinion.Nevertheless, if you can afford the product, you won't regret your purchase.You can read my full review here: [...]"
7223,1,Love the product not the shipping_This product toooookkkkk forever to get here. I was actually very concerned about it not getting here. After a month and a half it finally got here. I was really happy with the product. They are great and feel very professional . Would recommend this product to some would like to do there own nails and want a professional result
6946,1,Amazing!_I would give this primer 10 stars if I could. This is the first primer I have ever used and I LOVE IT. I have oily brown skin( I am from Brazil) and one thing I was always very disappointed about makeup is that it would ALWAYS melt on my eye lids withing less than 1 hour. I started using waterproof eye liner to try to have it last a little longer with not much success. So I decided to try a primer and I just didn't want to pay a lot for it and purchased the REVLON at a drugstore. WHAT A SUCCESS!!!! BINGO! My make up lasts over 12 hours a day. I am not kidding.I am not doing anything different except for using this primer on my face. After 12 hours my entire face looks just as good as when I first applied the makeup. I use the cheapest makeup form drugstores I can find and it will still be amazing after all day wearing it. I even use regular eyeliner and it will be just perfect! This product is very very light when you apply and makes my skin feel like silk. Just awesome!Thank you REVLON
9643,1,"Great price for a big bottle!_This is for all my girls, or guys, who have dry skin, hair, or nails. First off this stuff is amazing! It's not only super good for my dry hair, I also use this stuff for my nail beds as well. I don't use this on face, but I do use this on my knees, and on my thighs. This argan oil is huge. It's bigger than any other one, I've ever seen before. And trust me, this bottle will last me a long long time. This is a good deal for those of you who are considering picking up the Josie Maran argan oil. Not only is this one only $20, it's also made from the same stuff that the more expensive ones are made out of."
1767,1,"Love it_I love this conditioner,i left it in my hair for 15 minutes while showering shaving and scrubbing my skin,then i combed my hair with a wide tooth comb and rinsed it, my hair was full shiny and very soft"
5831,1,"Pearl, yes. Sparkle, not so much_As other reviews stated, the 'glitter' is only on top. Once that layer is brushed away, there is only a pearlescent color, which isn't bad. The colors blend well and they are very pretty. I expected a bigger pallette, but for only five bucks, I guess I shouldn't have.My packaging was well wrapped but still had a cracked cover, one color completely out of it's 'shell' and another color exploded looking used in the center.PROS: Great blending and variety of colorsCONS: Defective product prevented me from using/enjoying 100% of product"
8352,1,"Off-label use - hot flashes!_I've been desperate to find a product that can cool me down when experiencing hot flashes, so I thought I would give this 'cooling' product a try. And it works! It cools me down almost instantly. When it says CHILLED on the packaging, they aren't kidding.I rub one pump-full on my hand and rub it into my neck, wrists and inside my elbows. It feels a bit tacky for a moment, but then it absorbs into my skin and feels very smooth.I wish this product had a neutral scent - as it is, it smells like guys' cologne. I keep using it anyway, since it works to put a stop to the hot flashes in the moment, and for quite some time afterwards.My sense is that it is the menthol in the ingredients that provides the chill, although the gel-like texture probably also contributes to the cooling sensation, as it evaporates. I also see the formulation has cucumber extract and a few strong antioxidants like grape extract, green tea extract, vitamin E, and vitamin A, among others. So not only is it cooling, but there are anti-irritant qualities to counteract the inherent irritant qualities of the menthol, as well. It's like putting vitamins on my skin.This gel is amazing, and I am very thankful to have stumbled upon it. I think Axe could make a mint if they took out the fragrance and re-packaged it for perimenopausal women!5 stars for cooling effectiveness! This works better than the Poise roll-on product intended for hot flashes."
2033,1,"Too Much = Orange_So this is a really nice self tanner. As is the case with any self tanner, if too much is used, you're going to look like an orange person with a bad fake tan. It goes on a weird brown; you won't want to put this on before you go off to school or work. I put it on at night, and shower it off in the morning. I will make your sheets look like you wet the bed(there will be a giant orange blow where you slept) but that washes out. I have olive skin, and this product is 100% capable of making me an Oompaloompa worthy. Don't believe the reviews that say it isn't orange at all, because frankly, it is. The trick is applying below the orange threshold. I've tried every fake tan out there, for like thirteen-ish bucks this is not at all a bad deal."
849,1,"Classy and Intoxicating_I can't get enough of this perfume. Every time I go to choose a different scent to wear for the day, I end up grabbing this bottle (which is so gorgeous), and enjoying the fragrance all day long. It lasts and comes back so softly and alluringly throughout all my activities. I love this scent! I first tried it as a sample and I was won over. Now I only buy it in the large bottle. It's surely one of my top favorites ever."
7378,1,"Great for almost any makeup product_This is one of my new favorite brushes, although I originally thought it would be a bit bigger than it was. The bristles are only about an inch across, and for some reason I expected it to be larger. For me, most blush brushes are a bit large for how I apply my products. I think this brush is great if you have the same problem. You could actually use this for contouring as well. Of course, it's also great for liquid foundation. I wouldn't use this for all-over powder, though. It's very soft and has a nice looking design. I love it."
8626,1,"Worth the money_I am going to be honest. I don't buy into salon products and spending a bunch of money on shampoos. (I did a 9th grade science experiment with the class where we tested various shampoos and the end result was they all basically work the same!) However, I use a lot of hair product and sometimes after using the same shampoo for months it doesn't strip away the build up as easy. Well, I'm glad I tried Nexxus out. First the fragance is neutral so I don't have to worry about my shampoo competing with my perfume. Second, it is weightless, and a little goes such a long way. I've had it for over 30 days and have well over half the bottle left . (Just as a reference I have waist length hair)."
3211,1,Works with Shellac_I had first purchased from Bhavika A Vedawala/myotcshop Storefront and besides the fact that they took a long  time to deliver the produc came with a lamp that did not work. I returned it and  then bought if from Planet Stuff.  It was 5 dollars cheaper and Planet Stuff  delivered in only 2.5 days. Product came perfect. I just wish it had a 20 second setting and that the product was a little more 'heavy'/sturdy... But I guess nowadays everything is very fragil. It's a good product for a reasonable price. I use it with the Shellac nail polish.
817,1,"Fresh & Sexy Scent_This cologne has a great universal scent, and while probably more suited for a slightly younger man, could be pulled off by a man of almost any age. It might be a bit strong for an office setting, and probably better for a night out. Ladies will love it."
7376,1,"Where Have You Been?!!!_Ohhhhhhhh gosh, I was waiting for a reasonable priced makeup tool to give me the flawless foundation result that I was praying for and my prayers have been answered. This product makes any liquid foundation look perfect on me it is like my skin but enhanced in a very natural way. I will buy it again and again and again."
2149,1,"jo jo east baltimore_Wow!  I thought I was going to have to order from Japan or Korea for the rest of my life, for a sunscreen that didn't feel greasy, or cause a horrible white cast!  Very light and absorbs, fast thank you Neutrogena for making a light weight coverage sunscreen!"
886,1,"Dry, damaged hair? TRY THIS!_Everyone has different hair, so shampoo and conditioners are very personal things. I have straight, shiny hair that waves when it is humid. My scalp is oily. I was very satisfied with the Dove Cool Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner. My hair is very prone to split ends, so I thought I would give this line a try. What a mistake!! This made my hair greasy, limp, and weighed down. It just felt dirty and gross. I tried it for a week and couldn't stand it, so I gave it to my mother to try. To my surprise, the next day she was raving about this product. I thought was a complete dud, but she insisted otherwise. This is the cheapest product that she will use on her damaged, dry, color-treated hair. Usually she dishes out the cash for salon products. If she ever had to buy supermarket shampoo, she would get John Frieda and refuse anything else. If there was Bed Head, she would sometimes opt for that... but not anymore. She swears by this line now.My mother has a very sensitive scalp, and this doesn't bother it. TheDove Damage Therapy Cool Moisture Shampoo, Cucumber/Green Tea, 25.4-Fluid Ounces (750 ml) (Pack of 2)andDove Damage Therapy Cool Moisture Conditioner, 25.4 Ounce  (Pack of 2)made her scalp flakey. It also dried out her hair. But the damage therapy line does something miraculous for her hair. It smooths down her fly-aways and makes her hair look nice and straight (instead of all over the place), just the way that she likes it. After ironing, it looks even better. So on my mother's behalf, I give this product five stars.Warning: the conditioner in this line is lump prone."
809,0,No difference!_I'm not impressed with this smoothing cream.  I can't see any difference at all when I use this.  I won't be buying it again.
4072,1,This cream is amazing_I can tell the difference when I use it and when I don't. Please buy only the DUO made in France not in the US (the US stuff has a large amount of benzoyl peroxide which will discolor everything it touches (if you ever used Proactiv you know exactly what I mean). I feel like the French produced DUO is lighter in its formulation but believe me it works!
2032,0,"Not what i expect from Fake Bake_I love Fake Bake Flawless. Like so much that i have recommended it to every person I know. I have bought several other products on a whim thinking they may work similarly or better. But they haven't. So I went to order more flawless and it wouldn't arrive in time with my prime shipping however this Fake Bake lotion would so i took a gamble (reviews seemed okay). When i put the tinted lotion on my skin i was like 'ahhhh hello long lost tan friend'. I was surprised that there was no fragrance to the lotion even when I first applied it. When I woke up, I couldn't' smell the stale tan in a can smell which was surprising but neat! Since I didn't have to work that day...I kept it on for several more hours while I did chores, mid-day napped, lounged, etc. Well when I finally took a shower (I kept the lotion on for about 18 hours) all of the tint washed down the drain. When i got out, i was pale again like I hadn't put forth the effort to put on self tanner (we all know that to do it properly it's at least a 20-30 minute process. I feel this was a waste of time and money. Sorry Fake Bake...you really let me down."
5690,1,"It's okay_I definitely like it, but I don't LOVE it. The &#34;flawless&#34; coverage that was mentioned in other reviews is far from flawless. I definitely couldn't wear this alone without powder or foundation on top of it."
9071,1,Best Shower Mirror EVER!_*Easy to put in shower*Razor holder is the best ever*Just wipe off to clean it*No water marks*No fog from the showerMy husband loves this mirror.  It is by far his favorite.
5247,0,"Hated it_I tried this product because of the rave reviews from youtube gurus, but I hate this mascara!It made my lashes clumpy and did NOTHING to add volume or length.The brush is typical, nothing special.I recommend Avon SuperShock mascara over any I have ever tried! Honestly, it is my FAVORITE mascara, yet I never hear anything about it.Skip this mascara if you have one that you're happy with already."
7896,0,save your money_I have used these on myself and my bfs mom. In both cases I soaked them off and did something else. I used with gel nails and I don't like the way they look. The color wipes off if you dab with clear coat or wipe. The effect is sloppy no matter how thick or then the clear coat. I would not recommend to anyone who likes perfection.
5622,1,"Very think but NOT greasy_I have normal skin with an oily T-zone and this gives me a good base for makeup without making my skin look oily. Great product! I also use this combined with a Vitamin E capsule at night as a skin treatment, it works wonders."
3174,1,"Maybelline does it again! :)_Maybelline is pretty much the only brand of eyeliner that I've used since I was 13. I try new products from different brands, but in the end I always end up coming back to Maybelline for my eyeliner. Maybelline eyeliner is a staple in my makeup bag. However, when my brown eye pencil (of a different brand) broke a few months ago, I ran to Walmart and quickly grabbed another brown eyeliner. I didn't pay much attention to the brand or anything, only the price and that it was brown. When I got home, I laughed when I realized I had grabbed my eyeliner staple, but I had never used the Line Express eyeliner before. (Usually I use Unstoppable) After using the Line Express in Blackened Brown, I was very impressed. The pencil tip is soft and smooth, unlike most pencil liners. I also am fond of the smudge stick on the end of the pencil to give my eyeliner a softer appearance. As for the color, I do like the Blackened Brown. Although it is more of a light chocolate than a 'blackened' brown, it still is pretty natural looking and compliments my blue eyes. Most days, my eyeliner stays on for most of the day unless there is high humidity. The wear time of this eyeliner is pretty impressive. All around, it is a good quality eyeliner - especially for the unbeatable price! Since I recently ran out of my black Unstoppable liner, I may be purchasing the black version of Line Express :)"
6491,1,"Refreshing indeed_I have pretty sensitive skin and suffer from constant break outs. I have recently started using Proactive but sometimes run out between shipments.That's where this product comes in. When they say no perfume or scent they aren't kidding. There is absolutely no smell to it at all, nothing. Thats important to someone who might be sensitive to those types of things.It does make me feel very refreshed and clean when using this wash. I like to use my deep cleaning brush with this as well as the facial scrub.The price is reasonable and the product seems effective. I may consider making a permanent switch if the results prove to be long lasting."
3928,1,"pro make up_This was a gret organizer make up set!You had almost everything already in this!some eye shaddows, lip gloss, brushes, a mirrorit was great"
6498,0,"No No Nooooooo_I don't like this set at all. It arrived broke. It's not a great product. I'm not happy with it. I was expecting something different. I just dont like it. It's not a firm brush set, go to walgreens and get a cheep set from there."
7818,1,Love this stuff!_I use this cleaner everyday on my brushes. It is perfect! Leave my brushes feeling soft and smelling fresh. :-)
8225,1,So Cute be careful though!_I love this so cute! But be careful in which the way you grab it.  If you pull on the flowers while putting it on it will brake.  So Make sure when you put it on pull on the elastics.  It should not brake then.  I really like this it's so cute!
7232,1,I'm happy with them_I like them they look like they would work really well but I have not got to use them yet.
952,1,"Really works_I received the real deal, not a knockoff - I checked the packaging very carefully after reading all of the reviews about the Chinese version of this washcloth masquerading as the Japanese-made one.It works wonderfully - it lathers up much more nicely than a loofah and it really exfoliates your skin.  The only downside is that you'll probably need to use lotion after using this washcloth since it can really dry your skin out if you're not used to it."
4952,1,Love!!!_I got 2 of these without trying them first and was so glad that I did. I absolutely love the smell and it is very mild and sweet smelling. So glad I went out on a limb!
2822,1,"Can't go wrong with it_My husband is a prime candidate for Queer Eye.  He cares about his appearance, but he's just completely clueless as to what looks good and how to look good.  His hair, in particular, is a point of much frustration for both of us.  It is naturally messy. It grows in all directions.  Thank goodness for the popularity of the 'messy look' style.Still, you'd think getting a messy look is simple.  It's not.  My husband's method generally is to put some styling goo on his hands and run it back and forth through his hair briskly, like he was shining his head with it.  This is not the best method for a messy look, but it is what he does.  The result is often mixed.  If the paste is good, he will have a good messy look at the end of this.  If it's bad, his hair will turn into needle-sharp spikes sticking straight up in the air.Axe Whatever resulted in a darn near perfect messy look despite the technique.  His hair remained soft and touchable.  He commented on it having a relatively pleasant handfeel compared to his previous products.  I personally didn't like the scent of it, but the scent fades not long after application, so it doesn't really matter.Overall, we recommend this product.  I think Axe has done a good job of creating a styling product that guys can't go wrong with."
1114,1,"EXCELLENT!_Yes, it is a little 'heavy', but it really works well.  Not only do I have very sensitive skin, but I burn easilly and have allergies.  I have used this everyday on my hands and not only did they not burn, but for the first time in 20+ years, my hands did not break out from touching grass!  Awesome protection!  I will definitely buy this again and again!!"
442,1,Perfect._This powder is fantastic when you need coverage. I actually wouldn't recommend this for someone that doesn't need to cover anything though. It stays on very well and has never seemed to add to any of my skin issues. It has become a must in my makeup collection.
413,1,"CAN'T FIND THIS ANYWHERE_This has been my go to moisturizer for years. It's light but super hydrating. It also smells really nice, and covers up the usual sunscreen smell you usually get with an SPF moisturizer."
8424,1,I really like the feel of this shampoo!_I really like the feel of this shampoo! It feels silky and creamy and my hair seems to like it also. It cleans and treats my hair nicely. All is good!
2777,1,"Try This a Couple of Times Per Week ..._... when to keep your skin clear. When your skin is breaking out I use it every night for a week, actually I let it dry and sleep in it. FYI It stings a little and never really dries."
3192,1,"great for a young lady_I purchased this item for my 9 year-old for Christmas.  She had previously been starting to want to try drying her own hair with my larger hair dryer, but it was too big/heavy for her to handle.This dryer is a great size for her to use.  She has thick, curly hair, and she's been able to dry it in a reasonable amount of time-- no longer than it takes with my larger dryer.I was pleased with the price.  I looked at several of similar sizes in stores that were twice as much.We received the bright pink dryer with the zebra case, as pictured.  (Other reviews and the product description note that you may receive a different color combination.)  Having the bag with it is great for keeping the attachments and storing it, and the fun colors make it perfect for a girl her age."
6567,1,Very nice_I love these nail files- it works amazing and does not damage the nail- great quality and colors are fun.
8361,1,Black & White_This maybe my fault but from the picture I thought the chunks were more of a charcoal color. But the black and white looks great too if you put it with the right colors! I like using it with a teal or a bright purple! (:
3933,1,Simple & Basic_Come big enough to use for toner and it is sturdy enough to do the job. Simple & basic part of beauty regimen
9617,1,"Not What I Expected!_I was hoping this handy dandy would take away my post-baby stretch marks, but was skeptical it actually would. i had tried everything in the past and nothing seemed to work. But much to my surprise, after just a week and a half, my stretch marks had lightened up, and my skin became firmer. I can't wait to keep using it and see just how much of a miracle worker this little gem actually is! It does cause a little irritation after the treatment, but it doesn't last long and it doesn't actually hurt. The more I used it, the less irritation I felt as well. Overall, a GREAT find! Safer, cheaper and more natural than other options!"
5195,0,Not worth the price_This eyeliner gel is very thin and is more of a dark grey than a black. It is very runny and requires several applications in order to get the color and design you like.
3622,1,"Thin and flimsy_The classic saying &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; really struck gold here. These are very flimsy shower caps that I would not recommend using more than one-time each, there are a lot of them though!"
4126,1,"If You Have Dry Hair_I purchased these products together as I got them for a great price; individually, they are more expensive but worth it!  I have thick, dry, naturally curly, and now 'aging' hair.  These products provide me wiith the deep moisture that my hair requires.  Also, I tend to buy products that are 'natural' and not tested on animals and these fit the bill as well."
723,1,Rated the best flat iron in the world_Chi products are sold at hairshows that only licensed beauty professionals can attend. This is the best flat iron I have ever used. It makes my hair look and feel like silk. Also being a black woman my hair breaks super easily but when I straighten it with a really high quality iron like the chi I get results like when it's straightened with a professional's stove and the pre-existing damage is harder to see.
6625,1,"Really thick --_When I first poured this into my hand it was so thick I re-read the bottle.  It looked like conditioner or body cream.  The lather takes a moment or two to start to build and the quality is okay (not the best and not the worst).I am really sensitive to most soaps / body products.  So far my skin seems okay with it.  For all the added nutrients etc that it has one might think it would leave a residue but it does not.The price point seems good and much cheaper thanSeventh Generation Nourishing Body Wash, Lavender, 15 Ounce (Pack of 3)I typically use.  However I still like the Seventh Generation product better - suds up into a better lather, I like the smell better, and I just like how my skin feels.However, this Dove product is much cheaper and appears to have lots of conditioning benifits without leaving a film behind on the skin..."
1500,1,"Nice cream for natural hair_I was originally a fan of Asha's, but the service is terrible.  So I decided to try CD HHB and I'm totally hooked!  I have used over half the jar already and that's saying a lot for a product junkie like me.  It totally moisurizes and improves the condition of the hair.  Macy ships out super duper quick with free shipping so definitey by from Macy's.  This cream is definitely a staple in my hair care regimen."
3322,1,Works great_A nice light natural color that helps cover up those age marks and pimples. Good product by a good manufacturer at a good price. Why pay $30 to $100 for makeup unless your rich and full of yourself. This stuff works.
1906,1,"A good buy_A good buy, but it it's SOO small, will not see much of it working because you need more of it. But I could see it would work. Need to Ordr 2 at a time. To see it work."
6176,1,Handy tools!_I bought a set of these tools they are perfect for detailed nail art work. They're made of metal so you can just stick them in acetone to clean them and they're good as new. I haven't used the brushes yet. Very handy tools to have if you're into nail art.
719,1,"Keeping my hair straight since 2005_I purchased my CHI 1' ceramic iron in the fall of 2005 (almost 7 years ago to the day!), and my hair still comes out as straight and shiny now as it did then. The only real obvious effect aging has had on it is that it takes a little longer to heat up (I usually turn mine on overnight to straighten the next morning). Every now and then, a few hairs get stuck between the ceramic plate and body and get yanked out, but other then that, I have no complaints!When I purchased this, it was over $100, and even at the price I thought it was a great deal. Now, it is less than $50 (!!), which is a STEAL (IMHO). Sometimes I use a straigtening product first (likeJohn Frieda Frizz-Ease Straight Fixation Smoothing Creme, 5 Ounce) and other times I don't, and never notice a real difference in how straight I can get my hair (so I have pretty much stopped using extra product in it).I have been the owner of many a 'cheap' straighteners over the years that you have to run through your hair three times (at least!) to get it straight, and frizz still seems to be present. The CHI straightener takes just one run through a lock (although my hair is really long so I sometimes do two passes) to leave it not only straight, but shiny and smooth too.I knocked one star off because this puppy can get REALLY hot, and there isn't a lot of protection for your hand (keep it as close to the cord end as possible) or your ears (there isn't a lot of space between the sides of the ceramic plates and the body of the straightener).You will NOT regret buying this straightener (especially at this price). If/when mine eventually dies, I will most definitely purchase another one."
3509,0,"Not suitable for oily skin_I'm 36 years old and have oily skin. This cream's texture is liquid as a lotion but is very greasy so after you apply it, you will shine and shine, and shine the entire day, even after applying  powder or retouching your make up.  I wouldn't recommend it if you have oily to very oily skin."
7200,1,"Little but perfect_This product is excelent for mixed face maskand others powers is not to big but is easy touse ,  the plastic is soft and have beautiful colorcome on time and in perfect shape"
4029,1,"Love it!!_Great, awesome, amaizing, fantastic!! Mix it with the macademia oil and you get a super dooper mask. Take your time and keep it on your hair for more than 15 minutes and you will see the difference."
6301,1,"excellent product_very nice product for this price , love the all drill bit , they fit nicely inside my pro drill machine , I used them for acrylic and regular nails , they stay sharp and do the right work as expected . The shipping was fast"
675,1,MEMORIES_I have been wearing my Shalimar since the 60's.  This did not disappoint.  Love coming back home at the end of theday after my place has been closed up and the fabulous scent greets me!!!
1594,1,"Root Stimulator Olive Oil Moisturizing Hair Lotion Unisex 8.5 oz.,_I like this product because it moisturizes and keeps the scape oiled and hair shinning, plus I like the way my feels after I comb the product through."
9002,0,Would only shake out of container for one day_I was anxious to use this product to see if I could get a little more &#34;umph&#34; in my hair.  The first day I tried it I had trouble shaking it out of the container but got enough to rub into the roots and work through my hair.  The instructions said if you wanted more body to back comb.  My thought is that with back combing you get extra volume with or without this product.  I also noticed that when I finished rubbing the powder into my hair my hands felt sticky and gluey - not like when you apply regular baby powder or Bond's body powder.The second day was rainy and wet in Southern California.  When I opened the shaker NOTHING came out at all.  I banged the tube on the counter but except for a few flakes could not get anything.  I went so far as to pry open the top and when I did there was just a big clump of powder inside.  I guess you have to live in the desert to get this product to work.I'll not be using this again nor would I recommend it.
9638,1,Bye bye dark circles._Bye bye dark circles.  They are fading and I'm so happy. Have had them for years.
3684,1,I love this stuff!!!_I was slammed by the gal at the medical office on the brand they carry there and the eye cream felt like it was drying the skin around my eyes and making the crows feet MORE noticeable. I had used Lumiere before and knew it was a great product. I ordered and when it arrived I opened it and applied...the next morning my eyes looked refreshed and less scaley looking. In my opinion the best eye treatment ever! Awesome price too!
7331,1,It's a 10 for sure - but better!_I have been using the original It's a 10 product for years.  My stylist suggested I try the new Lite version because my hair is very fine.  Same great features as the standard product (which I LOVE) but better and lighter.  Works great with a flat iron - and makes me hair so much easier to comb wet.  I am happy with the Lite version and just ordered my second bottle.
5467,1,Not a pencil eyeliner user....BUT!!!_These are the first pencil liners I used...ever!! They go on soft and the colors are great. I enjoy using them on the top lid. Normally it's hard for me to do the top lid with liner but these pencils make it much easier for me to do. Not sure how well they'll be after sharpening but I'm sure they'll still be great. I would suggest to purchase these if you love color liners. They DID arrive on time!
1238,1,Mom loves it._I bought this product for my 70 year old mom to use while she works out at the gym.  She likes this stuff.  It has no noticeable odor and it most definitely makes her sweat!
9453,1,"Great lotion, amazing results!_I'm the type of person who likes to try a lot of different lotions and this one has really impressed me.The color itself is a light brown which reminds me of some type of cream foundation. It is very silky and goes on smooth, the directions say to let the lotion dry on skin before getting dressed which I assume is to prevent staining, but I have not had that problem. It only takes a few days of consistent use to see results and my skin overall looks and feels great and of course very moisturizedRemember this is a body cream and not intended for the face."
4207,1,"Works Well_I've been using this on my face after cleansing in the evening, there is a slight tingle/sting after putting it on but in the morning my skin looks brighter and clear.  Good price and good product."
7302,1,Works and smells great_I love how this shampoo smells. It works great my hair feels clean but not oily. It has made my scalp feel good and cut down on dandruff. I even love the bottle design.
903,1,works great_I love this eye serum. You hardly have to use any and it feels so soft and smooth on my eyes. It works great!
9642,1,"Pure and Simple_The magic of Argan oil - it is wonderful. The Insta Natural 100% Argan oil is just that, magic and wonderful.Directly from the bottle there is a faint sort of medicine / vitamin odor. Once the oil is out of the bottle and applied to my hair, skin, or nails - there is no odor at all. The oil has a slight tan color to it.The magic is with how great this feels on fingernails. The oil soaks in beautifully and makes my cuticles feel nice. It soaks into my hair quickly. Normally oil leaves a nasty residue in my hands; this soaks into my hands quickly. There's no need to wash my hands after using it.I like the simplicity of this oil. My frame of reference is Suave's Argan styling oil. I never realized that oil has some subtle fragrance in it. I'm totally sold on Insta Natural's pure oil.The oil comes in a standard medicine dropper bottle. The subtle difference is the cobalt blue glass that looks fantastic.I was provided a review sample."
7413,1,Beautiful color!_I read about this on a beauty blogger's page and couldn't find it online anywhere but Amazon.  The color is beautiful!!  And I love the packaging - adorable!!  This is the first item I have purchased from The Balm and wish I could find more of the brand in the U.S.  I would love to try out other products.  I am blonde and have fair skin and this color perfectly compliments my skin tone.
539,1,"Not bad_I love the smell, and the low-lather is not a problem at all, but the shampoo just felt really weird in my hair. Perhaps it's just something I my hair needs to get used to. Regardless, this is a purchase I don't think went to waste. :)"
6674,1,"Used it at the pool last weekend..._...and overall, it was a good sunscreen.  It is light, and does not feel like regular sunscreen does when you  put it on-which is a plus in my book.  There are no lumpy bits, as with other sunscreens, in the content of the lotion, and it is easy to apply.The drawbacks with the sunscreen are as follows:--it is not in a spray container.  I hate putting on sunscreen lotion, which is my my family have been usingjust spray sunscreen for years.  This would be much better in a spray bottle.--this only has 30 spf.  My husband, kids and I like to use a sunscreen that is at least 70 spf.Overall, it was a nice freebee from Amazon.com, but not something I would ever buy for my family, and not something I would use again.  If Amazon.com would let me, I would give this sunscreen a 3.5-I had to round it up to a 4 here for their starring system."
6735,1,"Fast shipping, but Very Very Small though..._My item arrived a week earlier than estimated time which is awesome... The colors I received are cute, but in the description it says 'Color: as pictures shown', but my colors look nothing like those images...The rhinestones are super duper tiny (I didn't think they'd be as small as they are) and I'm pretty sure there isn't 1,800 rhinestones in the wheel I received... but I'm sure these will come in handy for me somewhere down the line... I'll add some pictures..."
4149,1,I love this product!_It works great for my curly hair.  Very moisturizing and smoothing.  I highly recommend for all types of hair.
5292,0,"Good sunblock, but not as a daily moisturizer_I felt this product was a good facial sunblock, but it wasn't what I hoped it would be.  I was looking for a daily moisturizer that contains sunblock.  This product smells like sunblock and acts like it too.After wearing it outdoors I felt the need to clean my face off since dirt seemed to be catching in it.  This stuff sat on my skin, just like cheap sunblock.  I had higher hopes for this Aveeno product."
3664,1,"Beautiful_Beautiful color, great packing. I thought the size quite small, tho. I bought too colors, the red and the nude one, and both have great colors."
6733,1,"I liked it will buy it again._Used numerous lotions and this is one that worked good for me deep tan, wash hands after, I never got orange on my or my clothes recommended over a lot of other brands."
1220,0,"Did not work for me._I generally have a clear complexion but wanted this for the occasional breakout.  I tried it on two different occasions and it did not do anything to decrease the breakout/zit.  After reading the reviews of this EXPENSIVE product, I thought it had to work. I was wrong, this product did not work for me and I would not recommend it.  Stick with creams, they seem to do the job much better."
4345,1,"The sedu is OK_The Sedu seems to be OK I only had trouble with the seller Beauty and fragance because  I had the possibility next to my orders of being refunded if I have got a better price which I did and it wa snot honoured by seller , other than that, is an OK product. I still did not used it only tried it for some minutes to  see if it worked and this was taken by seller as used item. Oh well. The product is OK  but be carefu lwho you buy it form. This seller on the other hand did not know much about the product either. So  that is all the product seems to be OK."
7705,1,"Dark Brown Wig_It arrived QUICKLY, which is awesome, I was a bit surprised at how long the wig was on me, but nonetheless, I like it. I bought this originally for a cosplay but it is SO natural looking that I might end up wearing it occasionally! I even posted a pic on here on how it looks on me in general. VERY good, would recommend!"
2006,1,Good Product_I picked this up for my husband who sometimes has problems gout and as far as I could tell it worked well for a minor flare-up.  I'll post an update the next time he uses it.
1696,1,works_i can actually tell that my face looks like it glows and looks healthier everytime in put this on i just ran out but i totally am getting more this is good stuff
2177,1,"Good product. Great scent._For the inexpensive price, this lotion is definitely worth it! I bought this lotion primarily because I wanted something that smells different than the typical, weird-scented tanning lotion; I honestly didn't think that it would work as well as it does. After using Paint It Black, I have to say that I'm impressed. The 50x bronzing agents actually work (and you definitely have to watch, because a lotion that advertises as a 75x bronzer may not even bronze well)! I have been tanning daily for over a month and it wasn't until I used this lotion that I could notice a significant darkening in my skin tone. The smell, also, is absolutely wonderful. I was a little skeptical when a customer in another review mentioned that this lotion smells like Bath and Body Works' 'Warm Vanilla Sugar'. But - it really does! The clean, vanilla-y scent of this lotion makes it seem like you're applying a fragrant body lotion, unlike many other tanning lotions on the market. Overall, I would recommend 100%. It's efficient, creamy, and affordable. What more could you want in a tanning lotion?"
1227,1,"I'm impressed_I bought it for my husband, at first the aroma was very intensive and I was like &#34;Ops, too strong...mistake...&#34;, but after not so long it starts to change the aroma and I was surprised how soft and sexy became."
5190,1,I will only use wen shampoo now_I am an african american woman with curly/coily hair. This cleansing conditioning shampoo is so great. It leaves your hair feeling soft and moisturized. I have tried many shampoos and this one is the best. It has set the bar for all other shampoos. It smells good and if used as directed my hair feels great. I have used it three times in a week and my hair didn't feel brittle or dry. My curls even look better. I hate to say it because it sounds so corny to me but I think I am a WEN girl now. I have told all of my natural hair friends and coworkers about it.
2721,1,"Luscious!_This Vaseline total Moisture Coca Radian Body Lotion ROCKS!  The fragrance alone is worth the price!  It is thick, luscious and smooths into your skin with ease!  At 20.3 oz, this bottle will last me a long time.  Don't let the $14+ price tag make you run."
7158,1,"great protection and tone_Living in Central Florida, the beaches are just a short drive away.  Unfortunately, so is the intense, damaging sun.The first time I got this item from Amazon, it arrived in a rather flimsy padded envelope, and the contents had been smashed.  After contacting Amazon, a replacement was quickly dispatched.  Interestingly, the replacement was also sent in a padded envelope though it wasn't damaged the second time around.  A small box containing bubblewrap would have been a more logical choice.As soon as it was delivered, it was quickly requisitioned by my wife and stepdaughter.  My stepdaughter, prone to oily skin, thought it was easy to apply and loved the light color which matched her skin tone.  A trip to the beach proved that the SPF (40) was effective for an average stay at the beach.  My wife re-applied the product every 3 hours after sun exposure and she was impressed with the protection and how it evened out her skin.The price point is a little high but still reasonable compared to luxury cosmetic house brands.  A little goes a long way, and this tube will probably last though most of the summer season.  Overall - recommend."
9235,1,"Love this stuff_My eyebrows start in too far from the inner edge (nearest the nose) and they are thin. I have tried everything out there for years to make natural looking eyebrows. Nothing worked. This does! Make little strokes where you want eyebrows and it looks just like eyebrows. The most important feature is that it actually stays, unlike many products that initially work but disappear before you get home. I could not be more pleased with this wonderful product."
2929,1,"Its Very Nice!_It is a little greasier than what I like for the palms of my hands, but fine for other parts that get dry. This product has helped us be more comfortable during the winter (dry) heating season.The scent is nice, more citrus-y than vanilla-y. My sense of smell may not be the greatest as I understand I sometimes apply too much scent because of that. The scent of this product seems fine without being overpowering. The lotion is smooth. It would be nice to have a pump to help dispense the product, but having it without one helps to remind you to shake it before applying. Again, shake as best you can before using (especially the first time) as more natural products like this sometimes have a tendency to separate.The whole family likes it!"
1401,1,"Please don't change a thing!!!!_I use Ivory the lightest shade & this Classic Ivory. It blends perfectly and gives your skin an airbrushed quality. It even covers up larger pores and other imperfections. I love this foundation. No breakouts, doesn't turn ruddy, stays put and inexpensive. It feels like you have no make-up on at all! Yes, it doesn't have sunscreen, but you can always add it underneath. Please don't change anything because, I LOVE IT!"
8232,1,"I Like The Subdued Masculine Scent_The big selling point of this product is the scent for me which is masculine and fresh, though I also like the fact that this product unlike soap leaves no build up of film or scum in the shower. My husband likes it because it produces a lot of lather quickly, effectively cleanses, and also moisturizes his skin.This product comes in a few different formulations. The ones we've tried have all been very nice."
4501,1,"Love!_Love this for the shower -so my dreads don't become all wet, and conditioned-when i don't want them too..! Fast service!"
9254,1,"Love the prettiness of this polish_Love the prettiness of this polish. Like to sparingly place it on the tips, for a gradient, over a shiny black. Gorgeous. Am very pleased with the seller, well wrapped and timely delivery."
7833,1,"almost 5 stars except for..._I love this brush! all the good things other reviewers have said about it (e.g. rubbery handle, good size, detangling powers, etc) are true!! The only thing that made this 4 stars for me is when I brush my dry hair with this, my hair becomes quite poofy and static, so I only use this brush on wet hair. [Note: I have thin, fine hair, if that makes a difference?]"
6036,1,"gets the job done_The previous glove I had came with my curling iron, but I use these kind of gloves for any heat styling of my hair.  The special value of this glove is that it protects my wrists from getting singed by the hot iron.  Other gloves I've gotten in Sally's and other beauty supply stores don't extend far enough down my arm and so there is a risk of getting burned.  This glove is also pretty thick.  Of the ones I have tried I would definitly recommend this one.  It's a little more pricey but it's worth it."
4332,0,Hairspray good but sprayer stopped working quickly_The actual product of the hairspray is good but the sprayer stopped working quickly.  I take good care of my things and even tried soaking the spray head and cleaning it out.  It never worked again.  Disappointed in a level of product like this that would use a poor quality of spray bottle.
4865,1,"glitter pink_Goes on easily. Very nice color, not too flashy but the glitter in it does catch the light and sun- looks very nice. I french tipped it and thought it looked very classy."
992,1,"Great product, especially for fair skinned gals_The other reviews below sound like the folks a) didn't use the product correctly  (no matter what you use, you have to blend), or b) had a bad experience not with the product, but with the specific seller.  So I wanted to post a review to clear that up.I got the Eye Bright pencil on a whim at Ulta, since I was looking for something to cure me of undereye circles.  I am up a lot of late nights and dabbing extra foundation under my eyes just doesn't cut it.  Plus, the extra foundation tends to pool in the fine lines around there.  I've been using this pencil for almost three months and it is without a doubt the only thing I'd reach for if I could only wear one item of makeup every day.  The pink color really pops your eyes and makes you look wide awake.  Contrary to the other reviewer's experience, I find it takes about two seconds to blend (just swipe your finger under your eye quickly), and then I'm out the door.  I've received a lot of compliments lately that I look like I'm getting more sleep and that I look way younger (I'm a hair away from 30).  This is the only change I've made to my routine, so I know it has to be because of this.For those of you who watch the TLC show, What Not to Wear, this is the stick Carmindy used to use on all of the fair skinned women until she switched to her own line of products.  You draw it along the inside of the eye, the bottom of the eye, and then blend with your fingers or dab your dry foundation sponge over it.  Really looks amazing.I WILL warn you that if you have tawny or warm-undertone skin, this might not be the product for you.  It is PERFECT if you have rosy or even bluish undertoned skin (very common in redheads, etc).  Perhaps it's obvious, but women of color will want to look elsewhere (Mally Beauty Light Wand Eye Brighteneris a bit darker, and more yellow-toned)."
7734,1,"Holographic_Discovering I love the Maybelline Holographic nail polishes.  Already had one in a beautiful green.  Goes on thin; I used 2 coats and got a nice, shiny medium lavender.  Might try 3 coats sometimes.I did think it would stay on a little longer, though.  I used both OPI under and over coats."
1738,1,"my skin looked smoother and more youthful after just 1 day!_I bought this product after reading all the great reviews. After the first night of use I woke to very radiant looking skin. Yesterday, my boyfriend even complimented how smooth my skin looked.I have oily skin and was worried it would create an issue with my skin, but I haven't noticed any problems using this moisturizer.I hope this product will get rid of wrinkles, but I will continue to buy it regardless. The minimal cost for a HUGE tub and the radiance it gives my skin is defiantly worth it."
9271,1,"Love Fekkai products!!_I had never tried this formula of Fekkai, but I like it as much as their other products.  This shampoo has a nice, mild vanilla scent.  The shampoo lathers nicely and rinses clean.  My hairs feels smooth and silky; more importantly my color doesn't fade!  Four stars for the price and size of bottle, as it is a pricey shampoo."
1880,0,bad color pay off_I bought this because I heard it was a dupe for Mac's Woodwincked but the color payoff was so bad.  You have to pack on so much and even that it was very faint.  Oh well!
6759,1,"These are great!_They are a good variety of colors, work perfectly and look great.  These make nail art so much easier than scotch tape or painter's tape.  They are a little hard to manipulate just because they are so small but that's the point of the product"
5859,1,"Simply Wonderful!_This product is absolutley great.  My daughter has natural hair and I have relaxed hair, and it works great for both of us!  I noticed some reviews complained of flakes and poor hold.  I know everyone is different, but we don't experience those issues.  1) To combat flakes we use Oganic Root Stimulator Olive Oil Moisturizing lotion.  Squeeze some in your hand and run it over your hair, brush it through; 2) Rub some Eoc Styler gel in your hands and rub it through your hair.  For those shorter or more stubborn pieces of hair, take gel in your fingertips and apply directly to that; 3) Then use a bristle brush to comb and smooth hair down, then place in ponytail (if that is desired style); and 3) Place a silk scarf around your head, tie it as tight as you can stand it, for at least 15-20 minutes (the scarf should be a long rectangular scarft that can wrap around twice).  Viola! After you remove the scarf you have a smooth ponytail and/or smooth edges that stay in place, but do not feel hard and has no flakes!Note: to prevent build-up, spray gelled area with water at night for take down and repeat process the next day for natural hair.  Also you may use coconut oil or some other type of oil if you prefer not to use any moisturizer, but use one or the other, not both.  A build up of any product may cause flaking.Once you purchase this product....happy smooth edges and ponytails!!!!!"
4812,1,"PRETTY!_And I don't just mean the purple bottle.  I agree with other reviewers that this scent is pretty and delicious.  As a chypre, it's suitable for a romantic evening, but to me it is light enough for everyday wear.  For a 'celebrity' scent, this wears well. I hope the label stays active indefinitely."
4738,0,"Fell apart_After having this Sigma Kabuki brush for about 6 months, one day the entire brush head fell off of the handle"
7222,1,"All I want for my nail routine_I was using the tools from travel kit without any complaint, but it seems to become more tiring to work with such small tools.I bought these and they are full size which means less strain on my hands.I love the quality too."
4035,0,"Still waiting...._I been using this product for about a month, and I am still waiting to see the results. My eyelashes look the same. When I first began to use it, the next morning I had problems with my eyes (it was stinging and irritating me) but now it went away. But I see No difference. I heard that Castor oil works the best (didn't try it yet)."
4950,1,"Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess Body Oil_I had caught a whiff of this on a nurse while working in the operating room.  It was a breath of fresh air, and I had to find out what it was.  She said it was Egyptian musk and she got it at a beauty supply store and it was inexpensive.  I could not find it there, so I took a chance and ordered it online.  I just knew it smelled like clean laundry, so I googled around till I was convinced this product was what I wanted.  I am very pleased with the fragrance.  It is just strong enough.  My boyfriend likes it and it is so mild I don't get sick from it.  I like the clean scent.I think somebody should invent a deodorizer for hockey gear with this scent, lol."
2044,1,"Great as a toner!_I've been using this for years as a facial toner per my 85 year old grandmother's beautiful skin. She swears by this and Glycerin is the main ingredient in so many expensive products these days. It's too heavy for me to use on it's own, and I like the the smell of these two mixed together. I couldn't find it for a while at my health store, and I would make my own mixture then.I use on a cotton ball or directly on my face before moisturizer and makeup. Works great for dry winter skin and getting a healthy glow."
1289,1,"Must try! Great product!_Best moisturizer! Not greasy, but hydrates.  Make up goes on beautifully over it.  Doesn't break me out.  It's great for hormonal skin.  I give it a ten!!!"
6740,1,Five Stars_The BEST!
4046,1,Best Shampoo!!_This is the best shampoo!  My hair dresser uses it & I could not find it in the stores where I live.  Smells great & leaves hair shinny!
1956,1,Awesome when it works_This clay is great when you get the mixing right but man is that hard. I spend more time trying to get the consistency right than I do wearing the mask. But it definitely works better than any mask I've used so I continue to put up with the AP level mixing.
2985,1,"Give it a chance_When I first sampled this fragrance, I was disgusted. Upon application, the scent is so overpowering to the point that it's revolting. However, after 10 minutes or so, everything levels out. The perfume is very unique, with a blend of intoxicating black orchid, sandalwood, and musk. I've never smelled anything like it. To me, it's a more masculine scent, and women who don't like intense perfumes will absolutely hate it. I like it well enough, but it's still a little too intense for me."
795,1,"Who would have thought a shampoo could do this much?_This shampoo has changed the way my hair looks and feels.  I have slightly course, medium thick hair.  I tried this shampoo to help me straighten and smooth my curly hair.  Right away my hair felt smoother and more cooperative.  Believe it or not,  it's almost like it has thickened the strands.  My hair isn't as limp and seems fuller!  It is worth the price.  You have to try it yourself to believe it."

4137,1,"I am IN LOVE!!!_THIS IS THE BEST LASH SERUM I'VE EVER USED!!! My lashes are incredible!! Every single day, everywhere I go, people are constantly asking me if my lashes are real because they are so beautiful! I'm now on week 8 of using GrandeLash MD, and my lashes have all evened out and filled in so beautifully! They are sooo much longer than the fake lashes that I used to wear! I honestly cannot say enough good things about this product! I have all of my friends and family using it as well because the are in awe of my amazing results! I will NEVER be without my GrandeLash MD!!"
6638,1,Love it!_Who would have thought you could get such high quality without spending an arm and a leg?! These concealers are great for under the eyes or covering spots. You can find your perfect shade by mixing and matching colors. Great product for a great price!
1294,1,"GUCCI_I love this product. I have only had it for one week and already my face cleared up. It cleans my face and it feels invigorating. Its like a cream not a sudsy type and its simple. I still use the dermalogica cleaner with my clarsonic once a week and then use this everyday...Morn, Night, after workouts. Bye Bye acne!!!"
1964,0,"Waste of money-waste of time_I wonder if I received the same product as the viewers mentioned on this product.  It astounds me that people are giving it a 5 star rating when I would give it a '0' if I could.  First, I had the worst time mixing this product.  It clumped uncontrollably and adding more liquid didn't help, it just made it worse.  Secondly, it felt painful on my face.  What is with this 'tingling' sensation everyone is talking about?  Not in this lifetime!  It felt like torture.  Thirdly, it did nothing to improve the appearance of my skin.  I ended up with droplets of oil coming out of my pores as if there was no tomorrow after using it.  Above and beyond that, there was no improvement of texture to my skin, nor did it clean my pores.  Just when I thought I was safe, I found out the product did a number on my new bathroom pipes.  It clogged them up terribly when any residue flushed down them.  The product was dumped in my garden and good riddance to the container!  Never again!"
4013,1,"WEN Girl goes Cheap :D_I started using WEN about 6 months ago. Don't make me rave about it here, because I will.I was about to run out od WEN-- Time to order more here on Amazon, when I started reading the reviews again and came out with a link for this page. I ran out and bought this from Sally's and rushed home to use it. I'm sitting here with a fresh review at this very second. It is EXACTLY like WEN. Maybe a little thicker in consistency, but it's the same process and result. And I have severely damaged hair-- which is why I use WEN, and this works great. I like that I can buy this in stores, pay a considerable amount less, not pay shipping, and have it in my hands when I need it. Great product, WAY more convenient. Chaz Dean better hope that this product's popularity doesn't spread because it's sold at such an amazing price, he will have quite the run for his money on his hands. With America these days, Price is everything."
9327,1,"Fekkai wors as advertized and gives hair a youthful look_I don&#8217;t use conditioners, but my wife told me she enjoyed the Fekkai hair conditioner. It does not have the overpowering fragrance that most conditioners have. It has a light smell, is fresh to the touch, and has a creamy feeling when you rub it into the hair. She found that the results were what the producers of Fekkai promised: the conditioner gave the hair a brilliant and lustrous shine. She told me that others used it and found that even their dull hair was nurtured and gave it back its youthful and fresh look. She said the conditioner was very easy to use and she will continue using the product in the future."
4900,1,"Best Eyelid Treatment And A Bargain_Purchased in February 2011 and, over six months later, my eyelid skin is smoother, plumper and I even have noticeable eyelashes peeping out from the bottom of my top lid - I had not seen 'em in years.  After about one month of use, in March 2011, I had my regular yearly eye exam and the technician was easily able to take the Optos scan of my retinas since my eyelid skin was no longer so saggy (there was no scan in 2010 for that reason).  Even though the under-eye dark circles didn't vanish (these ARE less noticeable, though), I'm very, very pleased with the entire Sweetsations Therapy line and especially with this little product.  And a very, very small amount is plenty for my eyelid and under-eye area, with a bit left over to pat on my lips as well. The single tube with its nifty applicator lasted for six solid months so is quite a bargain compared with the other eye cream I was using!  Thanks, Sweetsations Therapy!"
4269,0,"Not sure what the liquid in this bottle is_I am really dissapointed in Amazon, I love this product, but I have no idea what is in this bottle. It had very little smell and made my hair feel heavy and oily..I am going to order it from another vendor in hopes that I get the original product."
3047,1,"Exactly as described..._Three things I liked best:1) a specific setting for fine hair, so I didn't have to worry about frying mine2) heats up quickly3) came with a DVD for those who might need the help or ideasI also like theREMINGTON Protect & Shine Triple Protection 20 Rollers Hairsetter (Model:H2020)for special occasions."
8224,1,"Must Have_This is my favorite tanning lotion. It gets you darker quicker, and it leaves your skin smelling delicious!  Plus, it came very quickly in the mail!"
3499,1,"Long cloth_Its pretty harsh... but I like it that way, really makes me feel like Im getting clean. How do you all store it? Like I try and hang it off of a hook on a hanging shower head caddy, but it always slips off, Im probably going to sew a loop of twine onto it, cuz that kindve bugs me."
1817,1,"Good, Better, continue to look for Best_Model in a Bottle works, but it could be perfected to work more effectively, meaning, to work longer.  It's worthy 4 stars."
6263,1,"BETTER than WEN!_I am so happy I found this stuff.  I had been using WEN for about a year with iffy results.  It just never seemed clean enough but the results were better than with a sulfate based shampoo.  This new Loreal cleanser is amazing!  My hair is not too flat or frizzy, it is soft and flowy and I almost never have a bad hair day lately.  It also has a very satisfying low lather that is very creamy and soothing.  And the price, cannot say enough good about that.  It also smells delicious.  If you don't like vanilla you may not like it. You do have to use a fair amount of it to get the results, but it is so worth it.  I highly recommend trying it."

3470,1,"Intense Beauty Serum; Boots is a 'Winner'_Okay, I know this is a review of the No. 7 Protect&Perfect; Intense Beauty Serum but, I must mention the entire Boots line is a revelation in affordable skin-care and make-up.  This serum contains stabilized vitamin 'C'(sodium ascorbyl phosphate) which acts as an anti-oxidant but, more importantly it will help brighten the skin, reduce discolorations and help battle existing wrinkles while staving off future ones.  It also contains Sodium PCA(keeps moisture within the skin), Retinyl Palmitate(Vitamin 'A'), tocopherol(Vitamin 'E') and enough skin conditioning extracts(4,to be exact) to keep irritation at bay with 'comfort' being the justification.  These key ingredients and others are anti-oxidants, wrinkle reducers such as Palmitoyl Oligopeptide and Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7.The 1st ingredient is Cyclopentasiloxane, which gives the product its slip so as not to pull and rub the skin to penetrate as it does so easily and will sink in or have a quick dry down so other products can be immediately applied.  This is alot of work for such an affordable product and highly recommended.Other Boots products 2 die for: No7 Age Defense Cleansing Balm(contains alpha-hydoxy acids to really clean and help exfoliate gently.  No7 Protect and Perfect Night Cream.  No7 Soft and Sheer Tinted Moisturizer is perfect(some are too heavy as a foundation, others too light with no refining quality to the skin at all), although good luck finding this one (fair) in stock.  Expert Sensitve Hydrating Serum(the perfect moisture boost for any skin type and at a rediculously low price.  Their Powder Blush, not the cream to powder in the silver case but, this one packaged in black w/see thru cover.  It goes on like silk and evenly.  If you ever thought you were too dry for a powder blush, or that it accented lines as powder will do sometimes, this 'ONE' will not.  No steaks, goes where you put and stays and stays.  Alas, my last product for sublimeness is their No7 Stay Perfect Foundation.  This is one of those long wearing, transfer-resistant bases.  They can usually be very dry looking and can texturize whatever skin is like underneath.  Ie: lined skin can look more lined, dry can look moreso.  Any scars, pot marks etc. can look overly accented w/a non transferable, longwearing foundation.  It's ususally best to have near perfect skin to get away w/them.  Not No7 Stay Perfect.  It has a moisturizing quality to it w/a satin rather than matte look.  All the above mentioned imperfections can use this base w/amazing results and it stays on 'till you take it off.  Who can ask for more????  BOOTS RULES!!!!!"
9089,1,Sweet_I love this brand..never had a problem with any of them..have repurchased them a few times..great staying power..dont come off till you want to redo manicure.
1984,1,"Good item_My sister purchased this as so far no complaints the on it at all, looks like it was a good buy"
5188,1,"WEN Sweet Almond Mint 16 oz. Cleansing Conditioner_I absolutely LOVE this stuff! It really brings out your hair's natural beauty, and for me, it does exceptionally well paired with the WEN Sweet Almond Mint Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment and the comb. It weighs my hair down a bit to keep it from being flat at the top and puffing out hard-core at the bottom; and keeps my curls together for the look I want; and all with no frizz! If you've been having trouble finding a product that will work in your hair, give this a shot. It is DEFINITELY worth the money!"
1718,1,"Nivea Hand Cream, Smooth Indulgence, 3.5-Ounces (Pack of 3)_This lotion is creamy without being excessively greasy. The three pack was a perfect value. I keep one in my room, one in my purse and gave another to my son. (The winter months can be brutal to our skin!)"
7937,1,Loved this_These are great for nail art. My clients love them esp the brand name labels. Easy to put on and easy to get off. Also reusable when taking them off the right way. Great for pros or armatures
4275,1,"I like this product! Better than Mary Kay_I've heard the 'Hydroxatone' radio commercials for years now and just ignored them. I've seen the product in my Ulta flyers and just never thought about trying them. When I saw this in Vine, I decided to try it and see what it's about. There are mixed reviews about this product line (mostly about order problems) so I was unsure about how this was going to go.First of all, this is not a SCRUB. If you take 'scrub' out of the equation, and see it for what it is (manual microexfoliating) you can truly compare apples to apples. Sure, initially the price tag seems kind of high, but have you ever tried Mary Kay's set? I did, and it just about ruined my face. Tortured, red, angry skin, that's what I got! Thank goodness I was a rep and got it for 50% off, that's all I'm saying.  I am a long time and faithful Clarisonic user, but in wintertime I just need a good physical exfoliator: and the Hydroxatone Revitalizing Microdermabrasion is a NICE product!The jar is 1.7 ounces, and at first it's hard to fathom that this 'little amount' of product and the cost of it, have anything in common. But, you use about half a teaspoon for your whole face, and only a few times a week. When compared to the Mary Kay product, in both quality and price, this is MUCH better. I also feel it is superior to the Mary Kay product in performance. This is NOT an everyday 'scrub', this is an exfoliator that WILL remove a lot of dead skin buildup in just one use. I use Retin-A and that tends to give me dry skin buildup quickly, and in winter time the Clarisonic can't really keep up with it the way I like. I enjoyed how this Hydroxatone product felt on my face. The exfoliating beads were effective but not harsh. They did not dissolve as I used it. It didn't take much pressure to get results. The biggest bonus: I have Rosacea, and it did not inflame it at all! My skin did not feel tortured after using it. A big plus, no scent other than a faint citrus/orange aroma.*Simply dampen your face, dot on the cream (cheeks, chin, forehead) and massage gently. Rinse or wipe off with warm washcloth and moisturize! Enjoy the glow!When this jar is gone (it should last me months at this rate) I will DEFINITELY have it on my rebuy list. It's so rare for me to find a manual exfoliator that doesn't shred my skin or cause it to be inflamed with irritation.UPDATE: I am able to use this as a pre-peel scrub (24 hours before your peel) with 50% glycolic acid peel or TCA peel, with NO irritation. Highly recommend! If you are considering a Glycolic or TCA peel and not sure where to get reliable ones, drop me a line. I've read the mixed reviews on those products sold here and would be afraid to try them too. :--)"
3736,1,Excellent_Order arrived much sooner than the estimated date. This stamper works great just like all the reviews said. It is KONAD- the real deal. Thanks again!
9529,1,"Natural?  Maybe Not So Much_I have never yet found a perfect beauty product, so I am always balancing ingredients, performance, ethical considerations, and price.The price of Suave is its most attractive quality, and the performance of this leave in conditioner is outstanding for the price.  I have waist-length hair and, contrary to the instructions, needed only one pump to detangle and condition my hair, but I did take my time working it through.  Two days later, my hair is still soft, and unlike many products, this does not seem to attract dirt.The ingredients are not so great.  There are no parabens, but there are various other concerning ingredients, including petrolatum and glycerinAs for ethical concerns, Suave's parent company is Unilever, which claims on its website to not use animal testing except in cases/countries where is is required to bring an innovative product to market.  If true, that is a step in the right direction.On balance, I give this product five stars for price and performance, three stars for ethics and ingredients (certainly not the worst, but there is room for improvement).  Four stars overall."
4528,1,"Smells Amazing._Despite the fact that cellulite is not curable, this product will make you feel like you found the cure.  It instantly smooths your skin and you can feel like tingling sensation.  I also ADORE the scent which is like a greentea/ginger scent, makes the bathroom smell amazing.  GREAT product."
957,1,"Love the scent_If you like citrus type products, then you will like the grapefruit body butter.  I just love both the texture and how it doesn't leave you greasy."
4839,1,Pale Pink_Light elegant is a beautiful pale pink with shimmer. It goes on perfectly smooth and it isn't at all streaky. I plan to wear this color for my wedding.
3064,1,the print in the middle is absolutely beautiful when you have a red background and you use ..._the print in the middle is absolutely beautiful when you have a red background and you use white for the bow and lines
414,1,"Works great and doesn't over dry my skin!_Got this moisturizer because it was the cheapest at Walmart, about $5 bucks. I'm happy with my purchase and I like the subtle shimmer that it has. It doesn't dry out my face, which I tend to experience with these 'brightening' moisturizers.  One or two pumps is sufficient for your face and neck so I expect it to last a long time before I need to buy more."
5317,1,Best body lotion_I have tried so many body lotions. This is the only one that works all day. Because of the dioderizing ingredients; not recommended for face. Very uncomfortable feeling.Great lotion for rest of body. Highly recommended.
7101,0,wrong product?????_Good evening ... I request this product but instead I got different product ( glycolic acid 35%) from cellbone company ... Can you tell me why???? and no bush .. This is the first time happened to me .... How come you don't check what you send . can you tell me what she'll I do now... Hopefully the rest will come and not from different products
3380,1,"My favorite mascara!_I have tried many different kinds of mascara and this is my favorite.  It does not clump and it stays on all day.  I have never had any issues with it - no eye problems, no running, no allergies, etc.  It's perfect for me."
7924,1,"Gentle formula that works_With some tips from my daughter's pediatrician, I successfully used this on my little 11-week-old girl during a sunny vacation at the lake.  She wasn't out in the sun much and I more or less trust any sunscreen or sunblock on the market, but in this case I was looking for something particularly gentle.  This is devoid of a lot of unnecessary fillers, making it great for little babies' skin.  It went on like a lotion, caused no screaming, redness, or irritation, and my daughter's skin looked great.I liked the simple fact that it worked well in our situation and did so without causing any irritation to gentle baby skin (despite the fact this has instructions for 6 months and up, hence me talking to the doctor).  The consistency is wonderful and I found that a little goes a long way.  I found it virtually scentless, another good sign.On the down side, looking at the price, some might want to look for cheaper products that probably work about as well.Yet I still recommend this product for those looking for something specifically for kids that works.  It's gentle and does the job."
8656,1,"One of His Favorites_My husband recently tried this deodorant and really likes it. He said it goes on smoothly with no chunks or little crumbs (some solids he has tried in the past have done that so he usually uses gels). It gives good protection from sweat and odor. And he really likes the way you turn the deodorant out. A lot of deodorants have a small little dial in the bottom to turn, but with this one you turn the whole entire bottom. He finds that easier. He said he'd definitely use this again."
2293,1,AMAZING_THIS STUFF IS AWESOME! I LEARNED ABOUT IT AT A SPA AND IT REALLY DOES WORK! JUST ONE DROP ON EACH FINGER OR TOE.
1366,1,Serum_This product does work. I purchased it for my wedding and I looked amazing. No bags underneath the eyes at all!
2248,1,Amazing.._I always thought the stronger the BP the better.. Wrong!! This 2.5% is the best BP lotion around! Works wonders.. Don't hesitate just get it!
8393,1,great for nail art work and it really works best part no messes and it stays on_What ark work done but have a shaky hand well theses are remarkable ..you can do so much with this tape.
7391,0,"I am not seeing the appeal_I have frizzy hair.  Generally, it is easy to curl and holds curl well.  It has been keratin treated and I loved the effect.  So I though this would be a great choice for me.Nope.  It is a pain to use.  The glove is too short if your hand is big.  The bottom of my thumb bumped into the barrel and gave me a nice burn.  I could not get the curls to work and my hair was still frizzy.  There was no noticeable shine or smoothness.  I was very disappointed with this product.I let my daughter use it.  She has smoother hair.  It worked better for her.  But overall I am not impressed."
2497,1,Very nice_Very nice for cleansing and moisturizing on a daily basis.  I love almost all of their products.  This one I will purchase again.
20,1,Good cleansing sponge._Sometimes I cannot find these in stores.  I have used it for years.  The gentle one is not hard on the skin.
9533,1,"Great Smell and Thick Viscosity for a Budget Shampoo_Many years ago I asked a hair stylist what the difference between expensive and budget shampoo is. Her one-word answer: &#34;Smell.&#34;So how does the Suave Seaweed Lotus Blosson smell? Very good. In fact, as I was shampooing, my wife walked into the bathroom and commented on the pleasant smell, which is not cloying or overpowering like cheap perfume.Also the milky white shampoo is thick with good viscosity, not watery like cheap shampoos.When I shop for Suave products (I'm nearly bald and don't feel inclined to pay a lot for a shampoo), I'll be looking for this particular scent. Recommended."
7732,1,Really Enjoy This Product_I am not sure whether or not this product has actually improved the appearance of my fine lines and wrinkles--but I do know my skin looks and feels more hydrated.  The product absorbs rapidly into the skin and makeup can be applied over it with no problem.
8790,1,always good_Took a little while to get this but this is a great conditioner for blonde hair.  A little expensive but well worth the money.
1105,1,Best Face Tanning Lotion_I love this tanning lotion for the face.  I have been using it for a couple a years.  Its gentle on the skin and I have sensitive skin.  It protects your face.
8125,1,"Nice Cream_As someone who breaks out in hives, I am always worried about what I put on my skin. Because I have used Olay products in the past I decided to give this new night cream a try.  While I haven't been using it long enough to see any major 'age defying' results, I do like it. It is rich and smooth, yet absorbs into your face without leaving it feeling greasy.  It has a very light fragrance which I also like. Will it take a few years off my face?  The jury is still out, but for a good moisturizing night cream I would recommend it."
6114,1,"Love,love._I love this. A must have for anyone who likes to design their nails with ease. I'll recommend this anyone."
2952,1,"Great_I've been searching for really good brushes that wouldn't break my pockets. These are awesome. Very soft but strong enough to put eye shadow on. The packaging however is horrible. The case I just threw out because I don't like the feel or the God awful smell coming from it. I read a review that wrote about the smell and I didn't believe it. Please believe it. Other then that, I love these brushes. Great for the price."
4203,0,"Nothing Special_Comapred to Eucerin, which I love and is recommended by doctors at The Childrens National Medical Center DC, CeraVe's hype does not compare to the quality of other moisturizers I have previously tried. This is probably more suited to oily skin, for dry skin skip this moisturizer."
9864,1,"Great Product_I received this product for an honest review and I'm glad I did.  I already have been using Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Vitamin C-Rum and I knew this would just up the anti on my battle of aging. I had never used this product before so it was a new experience for me. I first used the Vitamin C and waited about 30 minutes and than applied the Collage without any bad effects. I have allergies to everything so this was a big deal.  Now it did feel a little sticky at first but that soon went away.Living in the state of Florida my skin takes a beating from our hot sun everyday. I love products that help In that area, this product seemed to give my face what it needed. I had already seen some improvement on my face with the Vitamin C so I waited to see if my skin looked any better after adding the Collage. Well, it took about a week before I saw a difference, and I did see a difference. My face was smoother, and definitely had less wrinkles. Wow! My husband actually gave me a compliment on how soft and fresh my face looked. That made my day.  I recommend this product, it works and that is what it's all about. Recommended."
138,1,"Nice scrub_Not exactly what I was looking for, but it is a great scrub for gentle skin because the beads are so small. My sis likes that it is so gentle. I didn't realize that it didn't have any salicylic acid, though, until I arrived. If I weren't looking for a product with salicylic acid, this would have been perfect."
4178,1,"Great eyeshadow kit!_I really like this eyeshadow kit! It has a great variety of colors, light and dark. It doesnt have any useless colors that make you look like a clown. I also like how all of the colors are in a compact case smaller than a notebook that even has a mirror. It arrived in the time specified and was not damaged which I was worried about because when you drop eye shadow it usually cracks and breaks and makes a mess. I would definatley buy it again, the price is really good. Some of the other eye shadows I have cost more money for one color than this one did and it has 180 different colors!"
3749,1,for all you brown girls_This blush is perfect for my skin tone.  I'm mixed and pink blushes just don't look good.  The coral color is the perfect complement.  And it smells delicious!
6418,1,"great for kids_I got these for my 7 year old who is learning to paint her own nails, so she doesn't tip over the bottle. they work great. She can dip back and forth without worrying about the bottle falling over, since they give it a broader base."
9,0,Does not spread in very well_It is very hard to blend in to your skin.  I have to add moisturizer to it in order to blend it in.  Will not buy again.
5559,0,"Absolutely NOT for people of color :(_This moisturizer does what it says, it absorbs the oil for hours. What it doesn't say is that if you are a skin tone other than pale white you will look ashy-pale or ghostly-white!!!! No matter if you use a little, a lot, or wear under foundation, if you are caramel, cocoa, brown, tanned, your face will look painted.I am actually saddened that Clean & Clear did not think enough of people of color to tint it, test it better, or just market it for specific complexions."
8554,1,"Zingy, but runs out fast._I love using Basis soap. It's my soap of preference. However, I had a chance to try this Dove bar. My wife usually gets Dove brand soap from Walmart whenever we're out and I don't have mine, so I kind of figured what to expect.Firstly, this soap smells and feels fantastic. I guess the best way to describe it is 'zing,' while it does have a hint of citrus. It's definitely a spring and summer soap. It has a nice curve so you can handle it properly, and lathers up nicely with a loofa. However, like my previous experiences with this brand, it does run out very quickly."
9487,1,"I like this facial steamer more than I expected_I originally thought this would be a nice addition to use before doing facial masks to open up the pores and it does work great for that.  I also ended up finding that using it every night after cleansing before bed, it was so soothing and relaxing and my face over time looked more dewy and stayed more hydrated than just using facial creams alone.  Living in the bitter cold Northeast where we are being hammered by freezing temps and insane amounts of snow, this just feels so good.  The steam is so warm and soothing.  They provide a little ruler guide that you can use to make sure you are keeping the appropriate distance from the steam.  The steam is supposed to be ionic which can penetrate the skin with nano-sized particles.  The unit is super quick and easy to fill and starts steaming literally in seconds which is great.  The only reason I took a star off was because I did not get the amount of steam specified: 3 minutes when you fill the reservoir half way and 6 minutes when full.  I got maybe 2 minutes at half and 5 at full before it would start petering out and just puffing here and there.  Still not a big deal and always now use it on full.  Another issue is the price.  Quite pricy for this type of item and more than I would have expected.  That said, it is a great item and does the job very well.  Very enjoyable and pampering."
5038,0,Weak and soft_Bought one for me and one for my daughter. Weak and too soft for my taste. I rarely regret buying stuff bcz i can donate the stuff I don't want but this was a waste. At least it was less expensive than what it's priced at the pharmacies.
7539,1,Not bad_I got these for vacation because I didn't want to take my clarisonic along. These are very nice. A little softer than im use to but are a great alternative to an electric brush. And way cheaper. I would recommend it to anyone not wanting to spend the money on a clarisonic or other expensive face brushes.  I use my philosophy purity one step with it with excellent results.  Skin feels soft and clean with this brush. My husband likes using these before shaving to exfoliate his face.
5112,0,"VERY BAD SHAMPOO! BUYER BEWARE!_I want to first say that I love all their shampoos, but this one is very bad. For some reason my hair was in knots after using this shampoo and yes I used it correctly. It is not sulfate-free like the label claims it to be. Also, I experienced breathing trouble in the shower while using this shampoo it made my nose sting, and my eyes burn;even though my eyes were closed. I am defintely going to report this to the company because this is not safe for anyone to use, especially since others complained of the same problem. Please use this at your own risk and not on kids please, it is not safe. Before you buy this shampoo read the reviews on other websites about this exact brand. Please exercise good judment when using this on kids."
1122,1,"Great shade!_I really like this color!! It's a great shade - in my opinion, not too dark and not too light."
5235,1,"Wonderful Color, Not the Best Application For Personal Use_I love the color. We used the Evangeline's Red for a photo shoot for a novel cover. It looked amazing, so bright red, so perfect for a 30's starlet.That being said, it isn't a quality lipstick in self application. It was easy when a makeup artist used a chap stick base that was clear, and applied it with a lipstick brush for a perfect lip, but it isn't perfect for at home use. It does get thick and chalky like a crayon if you let it get too cold or too dry, which is easy to do if the case isn't on tight enough. Also since it is such a dark red sometimes you can ruin your whole makeup face because if you mess up and get anything off your lip there will be a red stain."
516,1,Smooth Base for Your Makeup_I'm using this primer after switching to it from Laura Geller.  I find the Mercier to be non-oily and it provides a good base for other face mkeup.  I wish it had a sunscreen in it though.
5744,0,"Doesn't work well for its intended purpose_This is an alright brush but I could not get it to work for blush application. It is too big for this. And, It just went on WAY too dark and it would not blend out the blush no matter how hard I tried. I can see it working well for highlighter, powder foundation, or setting powder, though. It is very soft and holds its shape well. These are good quality brushes."
2944,1,My sister loved it_Bought it as part of a birthday gift for my sister. She was very excited and pleased with this product. I will be buying one for myself. and delivery was fast and came exactly when it was supposed to.
5797,1,"Teen boys will love it_My son loves this. Anything that smells this good and has this good of a marketing campaign is sure to please most teenage boys. The product itself is a white paste, similar to the consistency of white glue. Left on my fingers after putting it into my own hair it feels sort of tacky to touch. The product gives that dry clumping look. Even if you retouch hair when dry the hair retains placement, but you can definitely feel it is still in the hair. Hair products are very personal and I would not use this in my own hair, but it does achieve the look my son with very short hair wants."
3369,0,"smells good, but messy_I've been using the soap for a three weeks.  It's really messy.  It smells good.  I don't think that I'll ordered it again.  I've used Nubian Heritage black soap and really liked it."
5858,1,Great_This is the only gel that gives me all day hold. It doesnt flake too much even with the big globs of gel i use lol. It smells plain but not bad. It does seem too itch to me after a while but i think i just have dry hair. I love this product and definitely recommend it
3115,1,Makes my hair so soft_Noticeable difference. People remark on how healthy my hair looks when I use it. And it makes my hair SO soft. I also use it as bath oil.
5748,1,"sooooooo soofft!!_These brushes are really soft, I got this one in the mail today and was not disappointed in anyway when I put on my blush, makes it look so smooth and blended!"
6323,0,"Questionable Shelf Life, May Cause Allergies_Sea Buckthorn oil contains the nutrients vitamin C, E, and essential fatty acids. To prevent nutrient loss to oxidation, this product should have been shipped in a dark vial, rather than clear. Vitamin C loses potency especially fast. At the very least, you should store vitamin C serums in your fridge. Sadly, this product caused my allergies to act up - my eyes, nose and throat experienced swelling after trying several nightly applications. If you are sensitive to herbs or fragrances, be careful with this one."
325,1,"Great Price, Better Product_I have been using this product for the past few months and my complexion has improved greatly. I love that it's all natural and alcohol-free. The price is affordable and the toner lasts for a few months with constant use. I usually apply the toner to my face, neck, chest and upper back using a cotton swab. I have to say it has also started to help some of blemish marks heal, especially the ones on my face.Other reviewers said that this product helped fight acne when used alone, but I haven't seen that. In fact, I stopped using my usual acne wash and lotion for a month and I broke out severely. This toner reduces the redness and my face doesn't look as blotchy, but alone it did not stop the pimples from forming. Although, I have noticed that my pores are smaller and my skin looks more even than before I started using this toner.It also works well on bruises. Normally, my bruises stay for weeks and slowly make that awful transition from dark blue to green to orange to healed, but with this I've noticed that my bruises heal within days with daily application.I definitely recommend this product to all skin types."
3427,1,"Always good_I only use Garden of Life products and they are amazing. Raw, Vegan, and no additives/artificial anything in it. Great product."
1267,1,A must have_I had thinning hair and brittle nails. I have been using this for about a year now and have religiously bought this. I had new hair growth and my nails are stronger than ever. They aren't harsh on your stomach at all. (I'm super sensitive to a lot of vitamins.) They also have a pleasant cocoa smell.
2055,1,"Can't beat the price_It's not a huge jug, and it's not the most wonderful fragrance ever, but it got me dark and the price was right. A good go-to, baseline lotion that won't break the bank, good for if you're just starting to build a base tan (no sense spending the big bucks at first). Would recommend to anyone as a good starter lotion or just a good one to have around. Can be used in normal sunlight as well and not so sticky that it's annoying to wear outdoors on the skin. Great bargain."
2688,0,"Made my face dry and peel_I have extremely oily African American skin so I have been exploring different products including everything from soaps, moisturizers, peels, and toners to control the oil.  After using this Neutrogena soap for the first time, I noticed my skin was dry so I had to apply more moisturizer than usual.  After about a week, my skin had a slight burning sensation and it was so dry in some areas that my skin started to peel.  This reaction was bad enough that I discontinued use.  About 5 years ago, I tried Neutrogena products for the first time (a moisturizer that was advertised by Gabriel Union), and I had a negative reaction.  So, with both experiences at two totally different stages in my life, I have tried Neutrogena and it is not for me.  I do not have sensitive skin, so I'm not sure what chemical is in their products that disagree with my skin.  I do not recommend."
3752,1,"Saves your hair_If you use a curling iron or any product that heats up your head then use this first.  It is very light, not wet and it protects your hair.Other products that I have tried were too wet.  This is perfect. Love it."
9858,1,"Wow what a difference._I have been using this for only a few days, but wow what a difference I've noticed.  No more itchy skin."
1843,1,"so soft_i asked my doctor what kind of insect repellent i can use on my baby because we were going to travel, she recommended this product. this product work well. i used it on my four month old baby cause the places we were going had mosquitoes and i did not want him to get bitten. i put it on him everyday after i give him a bath and even rub a little on his clothing just on case. he never got a single bite for the three months we were gone. i gave this a four because it didnt work for me. i didnt know why. since i saw that it worked my baby i thought i'd use some because i would mosquito bites. however after i put it on i still got mosquito bites. but im still happy with the product because it protected my baby and made my skin soft :).."
4356,1,"Wow_Ok...so I tried this one. I read a review saying it cleans better than prell. I still use my prell but this stuff is awesome! Smells great, clarifies and lathers well. I can't find it in that many stores. I don't know why. Next order is going to be this one because it's sensational and, for some reason, hard to locate. I hope they don't change the formula because it cleans so well! Go Herbal Essences! Nice product."
5942,0,"Too small for most blush brushes_Another reviewer mentioned that these guards were too small for her brushes, and I completely agree.  I purchased this set and the kabuki brush guard set, and the latter works much better for blush brushes.  This set is too small and it is very difficult to make the guards go over the brush handles, which tend to be pretty thick.  I actually managed to rip a couple just trying to slide the guards over the handles.  I tried the kabuki set and this worked wonders, as it stretches wide enough for the handles and shrinks back over the bristles and keeps the brush shape perfectly.  Don't buy this set, buy the kabuki set for your blushes, it is a better fit."
4486,0,Doesn't Work At All!_It's a no go for me....ugly colors that don't stay put. It's like putting a colored magic marker on your lips....if you like that concept....go ahead & buy this. I threw it in the trash.
9203,1,"1-4 All At-Home Peel_I&#8217;ve never had a chemical peel anywhere &#8211; in the dermatologist&#8217;s office, at a salon, or at home. So, when I received a sample of the 1-4-All Peel, I was a little bit&#8230; nervous. After reading the directions thoroughly, I decided to give it a try. There are warnings that many reactions are possible (and all within normal range, apparently) from almost no discernible change, to redness, to flaking and outright peeling. For my first attempt, I was cautious and opted to try only one &#8220;layer&#8221; of the peel. I was somewhat relieved that my reaction was not too dramatic, although my skin truly did glow afterward! Since you can only do it once a week, I am looking forward to my next one!"
5610,1,nice color!_Its a beautiful metallic color that looks very professional with the crakle touch. I 100% recommend you using this product
1909,1,"One of my FAVORITES!!_This mask works great on my fair skin. Yes, it is strong. I did it last night and two people have complimented me on my skin today. Soon my third jar will be running out and I definitely will be buying another. Since it is expensive, I just do the mask before special occasions."
743,1,"Fantastic Conditioner, Not Just for 'Extremely Damaged Hair'_Don't be turned off by the label.  You really CAN buy & use this conditioner, even if your hair is NOT 'extremely damaged.'I use it, as needed, about once a month as a healthy maintenance conditioner. My hair is short and relatively fine (not frizzy or curly), but I LOVE to use this just to keep hair healthy, shiny, and looking good.  Just shampoo, use the conditioner just like you would any other, but let it stay on your hair for 5 minutes (10 minutes or longer if your hair needs HELP).  Rinse.  You're done!The henna won't change your hair color & the placenta is not something you'd even notice was in it, were it not for the label & the super healthy shine it gives your hair.This larger bottle is hard to find any more, except online.Just as an FYI/comparison:  I used to like to use Wella's Kolestral for this occasional healthy conditioning, but they've replaced the lanolin that used to be in it with Mineral Oil.  No longer works.  But this stuff still does a wonderful job for shine, bounce, and manageability.  Definitely worth its premium price; a bottle can last a long time & you'll love the way your hair feels after using this.  Highly recommended!"
8303,1,"Economical product that works well_I tried the Suave Moroccan Color Care shampoo, so it only stands to reason I would try the conditioner as well.  My hair type is such that I have to condition each time I wash it, particularly due to it being colored.  I have found this conditioner to work pretty well.  My hair feels soft and luxurious after using it, and it is easy to detangle my hair, which is the true test of a conditioner for me.The conditioner smells great too, which is always a nice bonus.While this is not quite as good a quality as a salon product, it also is not priced like a salon product, so to me that is a reasonable trade off.  I would likely use this conditioner again."
9077,1,"Great for deep conditioner_I use this as a deep conditioner on my hair, with kinky curly natural it helps to soften my hair"
3735,1,"Work in progress_Still learning how to use properly, but so far I'm happy with this stamper. It works great, now if I can just get the knack oftransferring the design properly, I figure it's a work in progress."
7181,1,really nice color_I wanted to have this kind of color in my polish box.  It has more body to it than Samoan Sand which is really pale to my mind.  I have relatively pale skin (light) so I want a polish that will still show but not be overpowering.  This one works well.
842,1,"Sweet_It is really sweet smelling. That being said, it doesn't last a very long time(8 hours to 10 max). It wears off by the end of the work day, which may or may not be a good thing."
9647,0,"Not working_i've got this product as a gift from a friend of mine but unfortunately it didn't work for me. I didn't notice any improvement in fact the situation with my skin, especially on my face skin got worse (I don't know if the reason for that was this product but it started happening when I started using this oil)."
5813,1,"The Best!_This is the absolute best hand lotion! I bought this for my mom and every time I visit her I use it. I need to get myself one now. It seems a bit thick but once it is on your hands/body for just a little while, my skin was so incredible soft and smelled very pretty."
4045,1,Love luminary!_I love this lotion! It goes on super smooth and makes your skin super soft! Gave me and my husband beautiful color. Doesn't give you the 'I just tanned ' smell' I highly recommend this lotion to anyone.
5655,1,"These work great_My daughter who is loving nail art, is having so much fun with these. It is a lot easier for her to make her nail creations with these!"
1861,0,"goes on heavy, clumpy_I am disappointed with this one.....it goes on very heavy....even after I wipe the brush down. I wouldn't even dare to layer it on 2 or 3 times as many others do. I like fluffy, light, separated looking lashes and this one isn't doing it for me :( The only thing I like about this item is that the brush has a flat end that is good to use as a liner on the bottom lashes, I like to smudge it.UPDATE: so I have been using this one for  couple of months and I guess it dried out a bit,.....it goes on much better now....I can even sometimes manage fluffy, natural looking, non-clumpy lashes ....so.....it gets better with use :)  The sad thing is-this mascara is very hard to remove. Unless you have a very very good cleanser, you gonna have to use eye makeup remover afterall to make sure that you get it all off.....don't like loosing my lashes :) I am going to leave the rating at 2 stars still. I am going to try another mascara once I use up this one."
9631,1,"My Favorite GRADUAL Self Tanner!_I have legs that are pale, and unevenly colored, with spider veins, stretch marks, and cellulite.  You can easily see why I wanted a product that would even out my skin tone and give my legs a healthy-looking glow!  Sadly, most self tanners that I've tried leave streaks, dark-and-light spots and aren't worth the trouble.  Still, hope dies hard and so when I saw this product, I decided to give it a try.The color choices were confusing to me, because I have medium toned skin and I had the option of FAIR TO MEDIUM, and MEDIUM TO TAN.  What to do?  The only sensible thing  was to order both colors and try the Fair on my right leg and the Medium on my left leg.  Since I tried both colors, this review is for both colors.First, this product tans VERY GRADUALLY.  It was a full week of regular use before I could tell that anything at all had been applied to my legs.  And it was TWO WEEKS before I was able to see the difference between my right and my left leg.  SO.  IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR INSTANT GRATIFICATION, DO NOT BUY THIS SELF TANNER.  It takes a long while before the results show up on your skin, but when my legs finally started to &#34;glow&#34; it was worth the wait!I like the gradual tanning feature because this has helped me avoid the most major drawback of self tanners, which is streaks, &#34;missed spots&#34; and areas that are too dark.  When the tan first starts to appear, you will be able to see very light areas of imperfection, but it will be so subtle that it isn't noticeable to people who aren't looking for it.  This gives you an opportunity to even out the bugs before the tan gets so dark that every imperfection is glaring.  With patience, you can fashion your tan one day at a time and end up with really even toned skin that gives no clue the color isn't natural.The color is also really nice, and looks like a light, glow-y tan.  I haven't experienced that nasty, fake orange look that makes me want to run from sunless tanners.  The MEDIUM TO TAN leg is a warm but light tan, while the LIGHT TO MEDIUM leg is a just a subtle touch darker than my natural skin tone, and mostly serves to create the illusion of a nice, even color on my entire leg.  Both colors do a great job of covering the blemishes on my legs and leaving me feeling healthy, pretty and ready for my summer clothes!  I haven't decided which I like better, but might end up using the lighter color since I don't necessarily want a deep tan, just a little glow and even skin tones.A word of warning:  This tanner, (like all sunless tanners) does you no favors when it gets on an area of your skin that you don't want it to go.  My toenails turned brown, like the rest of my feet and legs, and it makes my feet look dirty.  BE CAREFUL TO STOP APPLYING BEFORE YOU GET TO THE NAILS.  This will take practice to make the look fade in a natural way, leaving the soles of your feet and toenails clean and pink without an abrupt stop-line.Also, you should consider wearing gloves to apply or you palms and fingernails might end up looking brown and dirty.  I always wash my hands after applying, but after weeks of daily use, I find that I haven't been getting it off my hands as thoroughly as I thought.  It isn't as easy to apply with gloves, but the final effect is worth the extra trouble.  Other than that, I haven't noticed any discoloration of my clothes or bed sheets.I have never used a self tanner that I was willing to use in the long term, but Suave seems to have addressed the most troubling issues of streaking and unnatural color, giving us a first rate product!  This one is a keeper and I am a happy camper!  :-D"
8637,1,New user_Just started using this product. Not seeing many results yet but I will keep you posted as time goes by
6876,1,Works great_My daughter got these for her birthday and has been having a lot of with them! She has come up with so many cute designs!
8539,1,"only a couple of uses and it's making a difference_My hair is very damaged from years of coloring.  When I wash it, the back feels like straw and it tangles.  I have been using a more expensive conditioner and it helps, letting a comb glide easily through my hair, but it is still brittle and dry.  After just one use of this conditioner, my hair felt less brittle.  I dried it with a blow dryer my hair was soft and manageable.  After a second use, I noticed it was not as strawlike after shampooing.  It hasn't made my hair heavy or look and feel waxy in any way.  I will update my review again after I've used it for a full week.  It claims it can reverse two years of damage in just 5 uses.  It seems to be working and so far I am very happy with it."
5265,1,"Incredible Foundation!_I was in search of a natural foundation without any harmful cancer causing skin damaging ingredients.. with full coverage, which can be hard to find bc most products that are natural foundations are usually tinted moisturizers offering no coverage... And when I came across this foundation I was thrilled... 100% Pure Cosmetics makes nearly all of their products out of fruit.. That fact alone excited me... So... I went out on a limb and purchased this product.. And I say out on a limb because.. I've never spent any where near $30 on any foundation and I wasn't sure the shade would match.. But..it matched perfectly.. The sad thing about this foundation is that it only comes in six shades... So it's pretty limited... Their darkest shade 'Toffee' that is the shade I purchased... And it was perfect for my skin tone.. FYI: I wear a honey beige in Maybelline SuperStay, Classic Tan in CoverGirl and in Revlon it varies I can go from Natural Tan to Toast depending on if I get a lot of sun.. I'm a lighter skinned black woman.. If you go to their website, instead of swatches of shades they actually have people that you can match your skin up with.. and I think that is very cool because it was so easy to pick out my skin tone... So, I would def. check out their website.. but I would purchase it on amazon because it's 2 dollars extra on their site lol... That's why I bought it here. Anyway.. The woman I matched with seemed to be a woman of mixed race.. Just to give you an idea of the shade 'Toffee' bc whenever I buy makeup online I always mess up so i hope that info helps someone else : )  I do wish they had darker colors.. I would love for my mom to try it out... But other than that..Incredible product, full coverage... It feels like I have nothing on.. Not heavy at all... Very light... Incredible feel..  Seems to minimize my laugh lines or make them disappear AND MOST OF ALL It's NOT HARMFUL TO YOUR SKIN!!! I LOVE IT! I will Definitely repurchase this as soon as mines runs out!ADDED UPDATE: So I had this product for a week now and one thing that I've noticed is that... Well, if you have oily skin this really doesn't apply to you... But for people with dry skin.. Make sure you have a really good long lasting moisturizer... I wouldn't say this foundation dries your skin out but I think it's more for oily or combination skin.. Initially when you put it on it has a lot of moisture but... within like an hour my skin starts to feel dry again.. So.. I'm looking for a really good moisturizer now to work with this foundation.  This may sound weird but I use olive and grape seed oil as a moisturizer on my face it works for me.. No break outs or nothing skin looks much clearer & brighter I'm on this natural kick... Anyway.... I didn't think I could find that much moisture in another product but.. this foundation still manages to get dry when I put it on..Once it dries on your face is has a satin/silk finish... Kinda feels like powder after a while.. which I don't like at all... And also coverage lasts about 6/7 hours.. I'm still in love with this product.. I guess I just need to find a better moisturizer to work with it.."
9291,1,"This vs. Clarisonic_I've had my Clarisonic for a little over a year and I love it.  I have experience with this kind of item -- I was using the Buff Puff back in the 80s and then I've used almost every invention since then.  The only thing I've stuck with is the Clarisonic.  I can't go a day without it and sometimes I use it twice a day.  For reference, my face is extremely oily and I've had acne since age 2. I got this item because I wanted to see if there was something out where the brushes were less expensive to replace.  This is not it.While this is a great face cleaner, the difference is in the brushes.  With the Clarisonic, I admit that I waited a very long time to purchase replacement brushes.  I didn't notice the difference from a 9-month old brush and a new brush since the difference is gradual over time.  But when I broke down and got a new brush, I could feel the difference immediately.  I wouldn't say that the bristles were like pins, but I could definitely feel the &#34;sharpness&#34; of the new brush and my face looked better than ever.Here's the thing -- the Conair brush bristles feel like the Clarisonic bristles after those 9 months.  It still did the job!!  Don't get me wrong, but the bristles felt softer, they didn't feel as penetrating.  After swabbing my face with toner there was nothing on the cotton, just like with the Clarisonic.So for me, while this does do the job and clean your face, it's just not the same as the Clarisonic."
4825,1,"Ruby Red Slippers_Yup! Ruby Red Slippers Glitter for your nails!I love it! It can dress up any casual outfits and it coats very evenly. If you have ever had a hard time getting an even red, this is the color for you! It is self leveling and the depth created with the glitter saves any slightly uneven application.The LED light curing capability is the icing on the cake!"
3448,1,"Not the same as an eye cream...but good stuff_I made the mistake of thinking this was like an eye cream that I could rub all around my eyes. I wound up with my eyes stinging. Then I realized that what it is really for is to put UNDER your eyes (being careful not to get it IN your eyes) to reduce any puffiness and smooth the skin. It works great for that. I felt my eyes looked brightened after using it a few times.The applicator is a snap to use and certainly suitable for carrying in a purse for that late afternoon pick-me-up.The first time I used it, not knowing what the product looked like, it took me a time or two or dispensing too much before I got a feel for how it was supposed to look and work. After that, it seems to just keep the rollers moistened and you don't have to keep clicking it to have it flow.All in all, a pretty neat product."
5383,0,"Lost my hair after using this product._I agree, this product should only be used once or twice.John Frieda should be ashamed of this product.After 6 uses, I started to loose hair at the roots. Not just a small amount.Months after I have stopped using it, my hair is still damaged and I am left with a sticky film where I had sprayed it. (my roots) Nothing is removing the sticky film.  Horrible product and I have told everyone that i know NOT to use it. A one star rating is too generous."
240,0,"Holy Black Opium Batman!_Whoa doggy! This is a strong, strong scent!!! My first time using it I got nauseous from the scent. I have been wearing perfume and oils since I was 15 and none of them have had that affect on me. I like strong perfumes, but this took the cake. Maybe next time I try it I won't roll, but dab and then see how it is. The scent was strong all day."
5891,0,"Meh._Clumpy, not easy to blend.  If you are looking to coat the rims of your eyes in a super thick coating of liner, this is for you."
4572,1,"Works great_I've only had this a short while, so I'll be sure to update my review if anything changes after I've had this awhile.  So far, it works great!Be sure to peel off the protective sticker when you first get this; it's really thin, and I can see why a few reviewers missed it.  Once you fill it with water, it stays fogless, no matter how hot your shower is.I've already dropped it twice on my tile shower floor, and it hasn't cracked at all.Great buy!  I'm glad I picked this up."
9684,1,"Gives you a mild, clean feeling_I have soft flat/fine hair so I try to find shampoos that give it some 'oomph' without spending a fortune.  This new Dove Oxygen Moisture Shampoo does a decent job of cleansing my hair without weighing it down.  The shampoo itself is almost gel-like; it's thicker than traditional shampoos, so it feels concentrated and you don't have to use as much as a regular shampoo.  It does a great job of lathering, making me feel like my hair is really getting thoroughly washed.  The scent is very light (like regular Dove soap), so I imagine it would be acceptable for both men and women.  While I'm not sure how much volume it actually gives my hair and if the 'oxygen moisture' is actually working, I will say that my hair doesn't feel weighed down after shampooing.  Because I'm not actually sure how effective it is with my hair, I don't know if it's worth the extra cost to purchase this shampoo on a regular basis, but I'd definitely consider re-purchasing it if I saw it on sale."
70,1,"works for me_I don't wear a lot of make-up.. just mascara and eyeliner so I didn't think I needed this but I got it just because i felt it i should since i do go to bed with that little make-up on and i keep reading and hearing its bad for the skin somehow. so yeah i got and its alright, it gets most of what i have on my eyes off, but not all ( i think i need one for waterproof) unless im doing it wrong idk. but yeah if you need a little make-up remover this works just fine. No itchiness, no irritation, no blurred vision (obvs don't rub it into your eyeballs) and i always rinse it off. its also convenient which is the No.1 thing for me. I love Maybelline so yeah, not bad"
5705,1,"Pretty light pink, but fades to peachy pink_Would have given this product 5 stars, but as mentioned by other reviewers the color does change to a peachy pink color within a week. Gelish polishes are great nevertheless, great staying power with incomparible high shine."
8795,1,Beautiful_Lovely and functional. I will buy more as gifts. It is heavy but it has holding power. Worth the wait for the shipping.
7204,1,"GOOD_I HAVENT USED THEM... BUT THEY PACKAGING DIDNT COME BROKENVERY VERY VERY SMALL, BUT THATS CONVIENENT FOR STORAGE. DEF LOOKS LIKE QUALITY TIPS.AGAIN, HAVENT USED THEM BUT THEY CAME IN A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME. IM HAPPY."
2254,1,"desert essence_I was pleased with this product.  Easy to use, comes in a jar with a metal roller top so there is no squeezing and you don't have to touch it or rub it in.  I apply it directly to the area needed.  With that said, the only thing I would consider is making this for your use only (ie don't share with any family members, etc).  It's not overbearing or drying"
9076,1,ADORABLE_Looks like my natural hair and all my friends thought it was real! great for winter lolita xoxox great buy
6402,1,Perfect Brush_I love this brush. The size is perfect for contouring. I love how dense the brush is and how soft the bristles are. Definitely happy with my purchase.
6974,1,"Another Biore hit_I started using Biore face scrubs about two years ago, and was absolutely blown away at their effectiveness.This from a woman whose pediatrician (lo these many years ago) promised that acne would be gone by age 21. Well, decades later, I was still dealing with it.After a huge success withBiore Pore Unclogging ScrubI decided to try this slightly different version.Different feel and smell, but same result.If you have oily skin, and perennial trouble keeping acne in check, this is the stuff for you. Highly recommended."
6390,1,"very good_.I needed good blending brushes but I can&#8217;t afford a 25-35$ for a mac brush. So I asked around and seen that sigma are as good as mac but cheaper so I got the E35,E25 E30 E55 E45 and the E40. They are very good and soft, very easy to use and clean. Shipping was fast and I really like them. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5, when I washed them some of the hair came out. It was the first time I cleaned them.  I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s normal or not. I haven&#8217;t tried cleaning them again I&#8217;m scared."
6177,1,"Expensive, but worth it_Have love this serum since a spa used it on me during a facial and I purchased it from the estotician. Much cheaper to order nonlinear."
571,1,"The Recommended Formula for Ethnic Hair_I LOVE WEN! I started using it about three years ago. It's now the only hair product I use. Fig is formulated for all hair types; it contains moisturizing properties for medium-to-course, wavy-to-curly, and ethnic hair.  Fig is a rich-density cleanser that helps to moisturize, hydrate, and replenish hair. I'm bi-racial and have the so-called 'ethnic' hair.  I've used many of the different WEN formulas--I like variety and I think my hair responds better when I mix things up a little--including Fig, and I love the way it makes my hair feel.Although this particular formula is the recommended one for ethnic hair, my first preference is Sweet Almond Mint...I still think it makes my hair feel the best.  When I started using WEN, I noticed an immediate difference. My hair was softer, and less dry. As I continued to use it, I noticed that my hair got softer and felt more moisturized. Now, after three years of use, my curls are springy, non-frizzy, and soft. I am bi-racial, although I have what you would probably call 'black' hair. Typically, daily washing makes my hair feel dry and course. With WEN I can wash my hair as often as I like--as a matter of fact, the more I wash it the better it feels. My routine is to wash my hair every two or three days (I wear my hair natural; It's soft, but has really tight 'kinky' curls, and is very thick.) On the days when I don't wash my hair, I just wet it and apply a little WEN as a leave in conditioner before combing it.I love this product! It's expensive, but I've saved so much money on other hair products--WEN Cleansing Conditioner replaces shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioner, detangler, leave-in conditioner, and even shaving cream--that from a financial perspective it's pretty much worked out to be even, if not cheaper! Furthermore, it makes my hair feel so fantastic! I used to hate my hair, and have done all manner of things to it in the past; relaxing, curling, braiding, you name it. Now I just wash and go! There's nothing like WEN! I love it and would highly recommend it! FYI Wen is appropriate for children too; although the recommended formula for that purpose is Sweet Almond Mint, as it is the mildest. Furthermore, WEN now also has a children's like...WEN Kids, which includes three different scents; Strawberry Banana, Watermelon, and Green Apple."
7278,1,Good Product - definitely notice a difference when I don't use it_I have very fine hair and after being sick and losing alot (which is finally growing back thank goodness) my hair was horribly thin - this product has really helped alot to add volume.  I definitely notice a difference when I don't use it.  Doesn't take a lot so the bottle seems to last a good amount of time.
2710,1,"Wow!_No kidding, those will be the first words out of your mouth as soon as you start lathering up with this body wash.Now, I should start off by saying that I'm already a fan of Dove products.  I try to use as many natural/organic health and beauty products as I can, but, living as I do on a limited and fixed income, sometimes I just can't afford to buy as many of those products as I'd like.  Out of all the big-name, commercial products out there, I trust Dove's to contain the least amount of harsh chemicals, surfactants, detergents, or any other potentially offensive ingredients.  And so far that trust hasn't been broken.The first thing I noticed about the Dove Go Fresh Burst Body Wash was its fragrance.  From the moment I started lathering up, the scent hit me right in the face.  Not in an obnoxious, offensive way, but in a 'My goodness, this smells so good, it should be illegal!' way.  The nectarine and white ginger fragrance is rich and decadent; it perks me up and makes me smile every time I lather up.  It's utterly luscious.  When I step out of the shower, the fragrance lingers on my skin, again, though, not in an overpowering way.  In fact, it simply adds a subtle layer of scent to any body lotion or spray or perfume I might choose to apply.The lather is the second fabulous thing about the Dove Go Fresh Burst Body Wash.  All it takes is a quarter-sized dollop to create an abundance of bubbles, certainly enough to cover me head-to-toe in perfumed foam.  (At 6'1', there's a lot of head-to-toe of me to cover.)  The body wash rinses off easily, leaving my skin feeling clean but not tight, moisturized but not greasy, oily, or sticky.  The nicest part, and the one I didn't really expect despite Dove's claims, is that my skin does actually seem to be improving.  I've only been using the wash a short time, about a week, but my skin feels softer and doesn't look as dry--no rough patches or flaking skin.  Now I can apply lotion because I want to add an additional fragrance layer, not because I have to in order to keep myself from looking like some kind of reptilian humanoid.I've been wanting to try Dove's line of body washes for some time now.  After experiencing the Dove Go Fresh Burst Body Wash, I'm just sorry I waited so long."
7599,1,Happy to find such a great price and convenience._I've discovered the savings and convenience of Subscribe and Save.  Love it!  I've used this foundation for a while now and love the light coverage when applied with a damp makeup sponge.
964,1,Excellent for really dry skin_I suffer from very dry skin as a result of being hypothyroid. This cream prevents the horrible itch and burn after a shower that is one of the side effects.Applying it to arms and legs every morning and evening makes a big difference.Its also quite reasonable in price compared to the expensive dry skin creams on the market.
4294,1,"Good product, great price!_Nice eye cream for the price.  I have very sensitive/acne prone skin and this has not broken me out.  I can't tell a big difference in fine lines being less noticeable, but they have not gotten worse... so, good eye cream for the price!"
8315,1,"Pleasant fragrance but doesn't detangle as well as some_I like the fresh fragrance of this conditioner and the fact that it isn't overwhelming. But I find that it's a light conditioner and doesn't prevent tangles as well asSuave Professionals, conditioner, humectant moisture, 28ozorSuave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner 28 oz. My hair has been rather dry lately, so I prefer the Humectant and Moroccan conditioner because they leave my hair tangle-free.  This one may be OK in the summer when my hair isn't as dry. But for now I'm sticking to my old favorite, Suave Humectant Conditioner and my new favorite Moroccan Conditioner. My husband says this one works just fine for him."
4984,1,"Extra Dramatic Lashes_I use this on top of my regular mascara when I want a more dramatic look. I either use Maybelline's Collossol or Volume Plush as my main mascara or primer when I add this one on top. This gives extreme length and nice volume, although both mascaras that I use as a base give better volume boosting results. I don't like using this alone because it is heavy and clumps my sparse lashes together. It works much better when used on top of another. I love using it on my outer lashes and it does give that false lash look, without the falseness. =D That's the best I can describe it. I always keep a tube of this handy."
8048,1,"Thick, rich conditioner!_Pantene has done it again!  I have never had a bad experience with Pantene, so I decided to give this a try, given the fact that my age may be starting to show!  This conditioner is thick and rich and smells great.  It does everything it says it does, taming fly aways and those silver hairs just fine, building the appearance of thickness and also, what I liked the most was it didn't weigh my hair down. Most conditioners do, but this one was perfect.  I plan on purchasing this again for myself.  I have very long hair, so I went through it rather quickly, but it's well worth the investment.  The promises made are delivered!"
5962,1,"Shiny!_I've been using the John Frieda Radiant Red Colour Protecting Conditioner for six months in combination with the shampoo, with one exception, see below.  I like, don't love both of them, and here's why:The products do make hair very shiny and healthy looking, and seems to add depth and dimension to the color.  It does make the color last longer.  I left these products at home when I went to the beach for two weeks, and used a good drugstore shampoo/conditioner while away.  On returning home, I was shocked at how my color had faded in those two weeks.  Some of it was due to sun, chlorine and salt, but since I always wore a hat, and spent little time in the water, I'm attributing most of the fading to the shampoo/conditioner I was using.  Yay, John Frieda!On the negative side, I have two issues.  I don't love the products' fragrance.  It's a bit medicinal.  I also have very long hair, and my other issue is that the conditioner isn't all that effective on the dryer, more damaged ends.  If you don't mind a slightly sulfurish fragrance, and you have red hair of a reasonable length, you'll LOVE this product.  I just like it a lot."
7354,1,"Seeing improvement_Please note that I'm African American and wanted to specify that because when I was checking reviews for this product that info would have been helpful to me.  In any case, my hair is dry and short. I have been growing my hair out for the past 6 months. And within that time I have 'experimented' with a lot of shampoos. For example, Aussie for mending split ends (great shampoo), Aveeno Moisturizing (okay shampoo) and many others. The only thing these previous shampoos had in common were they were all moisturizing.In the meantime, I was looking for something less harsh (something that did not lather) and to eliminate my previous steps for washing my hair (shampoo, deep conditioning, hot oil treatment, drying and styling). I performed this regimen every week. I wanted to try Wen but 30.00 bucks per month was too pricy for me so I dismissed the idea of trying Wen and a few weeks later I ran across an article about Salon Grafix cleaner conditioner. I finally found it online at Walgreens.com (was only available in one store in my area). The price was very reasonable at 4.00 a bottle. A win-win for me since 3 other people live in my house. If it didnt work for me at 4.00 bucks it may work for another family member.When I got the product I read the instructions dilligently and washed my hair. It detangled my hair and had a great scent to it. However, this product does not do anything for dandraff and I've found that I have to wash my hair twice a week now instead of just once to keep the dandruff under control. However, I am seeing improvment. My hair is not as dry and after the first wash I noticed my ends looked better. I will continue to use.Pros: Smells great, noticed immediate results (split ends almost gone), detangles, hair is softer, great price.Cons: No dandruff control, need to wash hair more frequently"
9624,1,"Burt&#8217;s Bee&#8217;s Face Wash_I have previously tried the Burt&#8217;s Bee&#8217;s facial wipes, (and love them!) and was excited to try the face wash. The cleanser has a very light, mild smell. It leaves my face feeling clean, refreshed and soft. I feel that it gets off all the dirt and makeup, and doesn&#8217;t leave any residue behind. This is a creamy cleanser, and does not foam up like other face washed might. But despite that, I feel that my face is getting a good cleanse from this product."

1590,1,Bright white awesome_Love the sturdy box great size range for all nail sizes very sturdy but not too thick easy to apply we all use these in our nail salon I will order more when I get ow thank you so much
6519,1,"High quality brushes_I am a makeup artist, and although I have pro memberships with several popular makeup companies, I'm not a brush snob. I was looking for new brushes for my kit for a couple of jobs I have coming up, and was allllll over the internet searching. I purposely avoided my pro sites and was just going to use them as a last resort b/c of the cost per brush. One of my makeup friends told me about Coastal Scents and when I saw them on Amazon, I had to check them out. I paid the $34.95, and couldn't be happier. I tested them on myself several days during the work week, and not only are they soft, but they haven't shed. I will update this when I wash them, but I love them so far. I appreciate that practically every makeup need is met in this set. The fan brush is huge, so it would be more appropos for dusting highlight on the body and not the face. The eye brushes are soft and not scratchy, and the same goes for the powder/blush brushes. The only downside is that the bag has a bit of an odor, and if you are sensitive to smells, that may be a problem. I believe it to be just the bag b/c I haven't had any reactions to the brushes when they're near my face. If you plan to use the bag, it may be worth airing out on the porch or patio.I ordered two more sets of these brushes b/c I've noticed that sometimes when I order from Amazon, after I buy, the item price goes up. I was able to get that fantastic price again. I highly recommend this set."
5164,1,Works Great_I love it! Its large enough for hands or feet! Cord is removable for easy storage and the top has a little handle for moving. Cleans up great with a cotton ball and alcohol.
1453,1,"Burberry what else can I say_Great Cologne, woodsy scent that is best worn casually ladies will love it because it is masculine and not fruity You'll find no metrosexual scent here this is all man"
9955,1,"Great Moisturizer_I am totally in love with this moisturizer! I love everything that Instanatural carries, but this is probably my favorite so far. It's lightweight, non greasy, and works excellent under makeup. Unlike many moisturizers I've tried over the years, it doesn't break me out, and I am usually fairly acne prone so this is a big plus in my book. I really like that it isn't heavily scented, and I feel better about using products that are all natural. I've been using this daily since I received it along with the matching eye cream, and have noticed that my sunburnt summer skin is much less dried out than before, and no longer peeling. I LOVE this product and highly recommend it!!! I received this product for my honest opinion and review via Tomoson.com and Instanatural and I'm so glad I did! Will definitely repurchase!"
6776,1,awesome_It arrives way sooner the order said it would. The color is beautiful!  color payoff is awesome and it is smooth going on  I love Sleek brand! ill be ordering a lot more of this brand
8501,1,"Pleasant Surprise_I have tried Axe products before and have been put off by the heavy scent in many of the products. This was a great surprise. It actually smells nice and not overwhelming. Best of all, it works! Even though this is a 'guy' product, it has a nice neutral scent that is great for either a man or a woman. By far one of the best dry shampoos on the market."
6362,0,"I Now Have Straw-Like Hair_Between using this and the conditioner along with the spray (think Sun-In Spray-In Hair Lightener, Original - 4.7 fl oz ) for my roots, I now not only have brought all the brassiness back. But my hair looks and feels like straw.I have colored my hair for a long time now. It is not in the best of shape but it is not too horrible either. Until I tried this product. I have used the John Frieda Precision Foam Hair Color Light Natural Blonde (Quantity of 4) with good results. A little brassy, but quickly taken care of by using John Frieda Sheer Blonde Colour Renew Tone-Correcting Shampoo, 8.45 Ounces (Pack of 2) and John Frieda Sheer Blonde Colour Renew Tone-Correcting Conditioner, 8.45 Ounces (Pack of 2) with good results and healthy looking hir.All the good that I have done was quickly turned back by trying these lightening products. I think I would have had better luck by simply using the Sun-In on my roots or one of those root retouchers instead of trying something that lighten gradually."
3772,1,great eye shadows!_Love the eye shadows! The colors are very vibrant and stay on really well. I had never tried Nyx brand makeup before but was pleasantly surprised. The mirror that comes in the compact is also a really nice touch!!
2919,1,"A FAN OF DOVE SOAPS_I have been a fan of Dove soaps for many years. I love the different scents. This scent actually reminds me of the pink scent of the Dove soaps, it's pretty similar. I also love how smooth Dove soaps feel and how soft they leave my skin. I have tried different soaps over the years, but I keep going back to Dove!"
7240,1,"Perfect set of nail art brushes_My wife runs a nail salon and she has constant requirement for nail art brush pens. I wanted to gift her something for her salon's first anniversary and I decided to go for this awesome Sable nail art brush pen. I was glad the product reached on time to surprise her. She was glad that I was thoughtful in getting the right gift for her. It is a set of three brushes meant for different purpose of stripping, mini stripping and detail. She says the brush is so well designed that even a beginner can paint amazing designs with this brush. Whether fine detailing or long stripping this brush set can make everything simple."
4503,1,"good_the inside is more rough than the outside so I flipped mine inside out and have been wearing it like this ever since. easy to put on, and great for days I don't feel like wrapping my hair. I did wash it first though."
8355,1,GORGEOUS!_I own a few other silver linear holographic nail polishes (China Glaze OMG and Nfu-Oh 61) and this one blows them both out of the water. It's super easy to use in comparison with the Nfu-Oh (which needs its own special base coat and is tricky to work with) and a much stronger holo than OMG (and much cheaper). Also fantastic for stamping. Perfect addition to anyone's collection.The downside to this (like all holos) is because it's super thin it will chip in a heartbeat and most top coats dull the holographic effect. There are two solutions to this: you can either put a coat of holo then top coat then another coat of holo OR you can use either NYC Grand Central Station or Sally Hansen Insta-Dry Clearly Quick. For some reason both of these don't seem to dull the holo. It will look dull while it's wet but as soon as it dries it's back to it's full eye blinding beauty.
192,1,"Great product, great price_Easy to apply, not greasy, gives skin some needed moisture.  Have been using Olay Regenerist products for a couple of years and I find them to be as effective as the Orlane and Lancome products I'd used for years and at a great price.  Highly recommended!"
2732,1,Cutest straightener ever!_I needed a tiny straightener for my short hair at the front that wouldn't burn me or be too large to maneuver around my bangs. This does the trick! It's perfect for what I needed. It is TINY. Plus it looks like your usual straightener went and had an adorable little baby straightener if you put them next to each other - it's just adorable.
7757,1,"Long Classical Curly Wig_This is a really nice wig for the price - it is not quite as thick as it looks in the picture, and the length of the hair is shorter in the front, but it is very close to the picture, and the color is as shown. The synthetic hair used is very good - the first time I wore it my husband asked me when I had colored my hair, he couldn't tell it wasn't real hair! Along with the wig, they sent a very cute pair of purple socks as a gift. I recommend this seller, and will definitely buy from them again."
4934,1,Works well and lasts_Thought I would try this product as an extra 'frizz tamer' that would work well with WEN cleanser and it does.
1757,1,Love these_They add lots of length and volume but without that obviously fake look. I can also reuse a few times by peeling off the old glue. I personally like the thicker white or black glues better then the clear ones because the clear glue does not hold as well.
3272,1,"Good pins; Do their job and don't break_Bobby Pins aren't really too hard to master, I would think - but as far as Bobby Pins go these are good.  They have a coating that doesn't come off, are sturdy and don't bend/break when I use them, and hold well.  Recommend."
1445,0,"Doesn't moisturize my skin very much._So this lotion has a distinct smell of sunscreen. Though it's tinted green, I don't notice any actual reduction of redness on my face. Also, it isn't very moisturizing. I still have to use shea butter before applying this. If I apply only this lotion, my face will be peeling off still.Will not buy this again."
3689,1,"Great Inner Eye Highlighter_Waterproof true silver eyeliner. It's great for lining the inner corner of the eye to open up your look or to underline the bottom rim of the eye for a special effect. Stays put, sharpens easily, wears all day or night."

The rest where all broken up. you can go to 101customnails channel to view a video I have posted to see how they came out.

8796,1,Nails nails and more fabulous nails designs_They are perfect for nail art designs you have endless ideas and combinations too make fabulous nail art designs too fit your taste
5129,1,KIND OF ORANGE-Y_If you don't apply too much its nice.  Start with applying a little and wait a bit to see how it goes on your skin after 15 minutes.  It's not real deep in color but a bit orange-y.  Rose maybe would have been a better color for me because I'm fair compleked.
9267,1,"Mmmm smells like creamy vanilla_The smell is wonderful, like vanilla & the whole bottle & the way the top twists off & has a dropper is so neat!!  Even the packaging is cool. A cylinder package that I keep mine in. I'm ordering another bottle, because mines almost gone. It works well in my fine, straight hair. I use a dropper full & rub it in my hands to heat it up (penetrates hair shaft better) & put in my ends & then whatever is left I rub on the rest of my hair. It works as well or better then my usual macadamia oil, but this one smells better & the bottle is fancier. I'm a sucker for packaging!!"
2501,0,"This conditioner is not as good as others plus it costs twice as much_This conditioner is a terrible deal, I'm sorry to say. My girl friend ordered it directly from Aubrey and it cost $16.92 for only 11 ounces. That's more than twice as much per ounce than Nature's Gate herbal conditioners and their products contain 16 ounces AND they cost way less overall. So the per ounce cost of this Aubrey conditioner is definitely more than twice as costly per ounce. It makes no sense to buy it, in my opinion."
1027,1,It Works_This is a fantastic purple shampoo that works after just one wash. You can literally see a difference in your hair color the next morning.
4483,0,"Don`t buy this product from Big Sale!!_I received the product completely damaged! the lid of the pot was broken so, I lost a large part of the product! you pay roughly 40 U$ for something and get it damaged?this is unacceptable!

9242,1,"My husband gives it ten stars out of 5_I requested this for my husband to use.  He's an electrician and often works outdoors.  He is really good about wearing sunscreen on a daily basis.  He is always looking for a light weight, non greasy feel that he can spray on.Both of us love the smell.  Seriously, it smells more like a cologne or deodorant than a sunscreen.  It's lightweight, dries quickly and does not leave him feeling greasy.  He also enjoys the lock on the cap so that he doesn't accidentally spray himself.The only cons are: the price point.  That's expensive.  And we both wish it was higher SPF."
2504,1,Five Stars_Love it!
5308,0,"Doesn't even come close to the quality of my usual shampoo_I did not like this product at all.  Since I received this product through the vine program, I figured I'd give it a try since I'm always looking for quality products that are at a good price and there appeared to be a lot of favorable reviews for this product so I was hopefully optimistic.The normal everyday shampoo I typically use is Matrix Biolage for color treated hair so in fairness, I'm comparing the Aveeno product against a professional 'salon' product. My hair texture is medium so according to the Aveeno product description, this product should have been appropriate for my colored hair.What I initially realized when using this product is that there is very little lather.  There is so little lather that I found myself washing my hair twice and using A LOT more shampoo than what I would use normally to get the same clean feeling that I'm used to.  In addition, this product felt like it left a heavy film on my hair which made it virtually impossible to style.  I usually can simply blow dry my hair while crunching it with my fingers and it looks great.  While using this shampoo, my hair lacked body and felt flat.  In addition, this product did not preserve the dark color of my hair and after only a week of use, I could tell a noticeable change in my hair color - my dark brown hair was a lot lighter, more golden.I would not purchase this product in the future.  I'm pretty flexible when it comes to hair products and cosmetics and I definitely will use a department store brand when I find a quality product.  The Aveena shampoo, in my experience, simply didn't come close to the quality I get from my usual shampoo and I wouldn't recommend it nor use it again in the future."
43,1,"Like it says 'Just a Dap Heals Dry Skin'_Every winter my hands get really chapped.  Even if I wear gloves.  They crack and bleed and are just not attractive.  Every year I try to find something that works.  I took a chance and bought this item.  It's amazing!  I put some on last night and immediately noticed that my knuckles weren't as tight and my skin was softer.  Applied a little more before bedtime.  This morning, my hands are silky smooth.  There's no cracking, no chapping and they look amazing!It is thick, and until it absorbs it leaves your hands feeling a little weird.  But it doesn't take long to absorb and that feeling goes away.  For the results, it's well worth it!I recommend this product to anyone who can't find anything that works."
8082,1,"Great product and easy to use!_I love that you have 2 items in one, you can use the liquid liner on upper lash line and the pencil on lower works wonderful!"
1633,1,"GREAT! GET IT!_excellent shade, not very translucent at all, but if yo are light complexion this covers and stays half of the day pretty good. i have a year with it and has lasted so long, i think it'll run out next year. GET IT!"
6570,1,"Messy delivery, but good assortment_For the price, the assortment was amazing compared to others. However, it was delivered with all the rhinestones mixed together in the compartments. One of the containers got jostled so badly that the rhinestones got stuck in the side area where the plastic wheel turns. The only way I could get to the rhinestones in that container was to break it and repackage the rhinestones into another container."
6588,1,"this is an awesome blow dryer!  i love it!_hey there, it's me again with another review! lol.  i bought it at the same time i bought the steam setter, and i love it!  it dries my hair way faster and is easier to use than my old hair dryer.  plus it doesn't hurt my arm as much as the old one did.  it's got great features. my favorite features are the multi temperature and different speeds.  i really like the color purple it came in too.  the concentrator included is really awesome too.  i'm not sure about the diffuser yet.  i'm not too big of a fan of  diffusers.  the fact that it's got the velcro to keep the cord wound up is a very good thing.  it's a really nice product for the price i paid for it.  i also give this a 5 stars rating too."
2464,1,wow_i recieved this product a few days agao and used it in the shower yesterday and it was like magic. I had a cold non stop runny nose so I constantly had tissue to my nose causing it to become super dry and began to peel. I used this to remove the excess skin off and I was shocked. its so soft and easy to apply I applied a dime size amount to my hand and rubbed it all over my face and my nose and was shocked to see how clean and smooth my face was. The only bad thing about this item is that all the writing is in japanese/ chinese. It did not come with and instructs at all.
1571,0,Not the color shown on the box_this item did not color my hair to the shade it showed on the box or near enough to the color. I left it on the correct amount of time and it didnt do its magic. Would purchase again
6132,1,Well made and meets their purpose_Thus far I've been very satisfied with my purchases from China. These are well constructed and do well to shape your hair when fixing it with a blow dryer or letting it air dry.
8954,1,"A Quality Snorkel & Mask_This is a big step up from your basic mask and snorkel. It isn't what I'd consider pro-level, but close enough for me and at a welcome price point. Yes, this is labelled a woman's mask, but it fits men as well. My wife likes it, but so does my daughter and even my son. The strap is easel adjustable and it fits comfortably over a variety of facial/head sizes. The lens area is large and clear, offering an excellent view of the underwater world. The snorkel is actually the best part, sitting comfortably in the mouth and very adjustable. I like the feature that closes it when underwater, but it is also very easy to clear. I'd recommend the U.S. Divers Phantom LX mask to anyone who wants quality mask and snorkel set for a reasonable price.~ Kort"
1773,1,Great Product_Good for my dry/combination skin. Goes on flawless and the color is not too light. I just started using it and I like it much more than powder or liquid because it blends very nicely.
8753,1,Subtle and comfortable to wear_I really dislike lip gloss because it is sticky.  I'm also not a fan of lipstick for daily use because it feels too heavy.  Color Whisper in &#34;Go Nude&#34; is a great compromise. It isn't heavy in feel or coverage.  The color and shine are just enough. I wish it had sunscreen so that I could wear it more often but I'm happy with this purchase.  My 15 and 18 year old daughters also like it and have borrowed it a few times.
5223,1,"Good, But..._It's a good color. I got it as a gift for my friend and she absolutely loved it. However, it isn't a lot of product for the price."
6374,0,"e.l.f corrective concealer pallet_This is the 1st concealer I ever purchased and mainly for the yellow color.I do not like this product at all! Its very thick and very very hard to blend!Thus far I have bought 4 different yellow tube concealers from other brands and thankfully they are like magic! Im still searching for the best one, but I do not recommend this at all, and you get what you pay for because its cheap!I love e.l.f's brushe's and eye shades but not this product!!"
6612,1,"brill Shampoo_I like this shampoo because it was the only shampoo that was able to soften my hair where it is managable without adding a lot of silicons and hair additives to my hair. The only down side is that i wish acure organics would offer more ingredients that are higher in moisturizing content than what they have currently. but despite this, i still give them 5 stars. nice!"
5984,1,"great kit_I love this little kit. I bought it because I didnt want to shell out the money for the big cleanser bottle. This kit is awesome for me because I dont really use the other products that often. I dont use the mask and gel (or others listed) very often--maybe once a week, once every two weeks maybe (??). I feel like because I dont use the little bottles very often, its definately a good bang for my buck. I just buy the big bottle of the cleanser because I use that most often.I use the cleanser daily, some times twice a day. The clay mask and gel are my favorite (second and third to the cleanser). I bought the cleanser years and years ago and I forgot the name of it. I just remembered that it had that minty/tea tree/eucalyptus type smell to it (which I like). I finally figured it out by doing enough research, and review comment readings.I like this cleanser counter to the other ones Dermalogica sells. In my early twenties, I remembered this being a miracle cleanser that hooked up clear skin practically over night. However, as an adult with menstrual acne, I noticed that it didnt work as well as I remembered. I noticed that the first week or so I was breaking out, more than I usually would have...AFTER this first week or so, it cleared up. I dont know if it was just purging gross toxins (I dont wear face [foundations/powders/etc] make up by the way). But I was really pleased with the results after the first week.I noticed that if I get lazy and dont wash my face daily (twice a day on the days I work out), I break out instantly. So I actually keep a regimen of washing my face.Side note: after I wash my face with the cleanser, I use an aloe vera , and then a spf 30 antioxidant lotion on my face/neck (aloe/lotion not dermalogica products). I dont really use any other products in the kit so this review is mainly for the cleanser. The other over night gel is cool but I dont think the name 'over night' is a good name. It gives me the feeling that it should clear up your face over night and thats not the case. I guess it just means you wear it over night, but it seems a bit misleading. And the mattifier feels weird. It looks like that weird gel thats in baby diapers once it gets wet. I didnt like the feeling of it on my face so i dont use those products very often. But the clay mask is amazing. I like it because it doesnt dry out your face like those cheap ones you get at the drug store. I use that when I have a problem area. Works like a charm in getting the blemish to go away a lot sooner than it normally would take."
8103,1,"Protects, feels great, almost no smell_Two things I usually dislike about sunscreens - the smell and the greasy feel - are absent from this lotion. It goes on very easily and makes my skin feel soft, and it's totally unscented (to me, at least) - no chemical or coconut smell. I spent several hours outdoors without getting any tan or redness on my face. It didn't sting, either."
471,1,"Effective_I was surprised to see so many negative reviews for this device.Granted, the misting option does not work very well and is useless. There is reduced suction when using the narrower side of the nozzle. For these reasons, I give the pore cleaner four stars, instead of five.When I use the pore cleaner I use it dry, right after I've either washed or steamed my face. I always use the wider side of the nozzle, and run the device in slow, gentle strokes across my face.To leave it in one place for too long could cause some of the problems (hickeys, etc.) that I've read about in previous reviews. In fact, the instructions that I received with the cleaner discourage leaving the nozzle in a specific area for a lengthy time.Another thing one has to remember is to rinse the device often. If you remove the nozzle, you will see a very small, fine screen not unlike what you see in faucet nozzles. Because the area is so small, any sebum or dead skin that is sucked in there can cause the suction to be reduced, clogging it.Anyway, enough of explaining how to use it.I have very delicate, sensitive skin with very small pores... but I can get oily and develop small blackheads in my 'T-zone.' So far, I have had this pore cleaner for a few years and it has worked wonderfully for me... better than the pore strips that leave red welts on my face for hours (I think I'm allergic to the adhesive).It is well-built and I have had no problems with it functioning so far."
4655,1,I like it!_I liked this product paired with the creme jelle styler. Both together did wonders for my hair and it felt soft and manageable at the end of the day. I will definitely buy both again!
3019,1,"This eyeliner is my favorite!_love love love this eyeliner. It's so easy to apply and don't run even when you sweat. Makes a really defined line, awesome! Highly recommended!"
3256,1,Works great as a primer!_I use this as a primer under lighter colors and bold colors that I want to stay vivid. Haven't had any troubles with it creasing.
7416,1,Excellent!!!_I have fun using this items and my daughter love all the design i can do with them... It is something that I love and thankful that I got it... love this item and give it a 5 stars... thank you again amazon  for this item.
9772,1,My favorite makeup applicator!_I bought this sponge more than a few months ago and I do love it. However I use revlon CS foundation and it's a pain in the butt to clean. It's starting to wear and tear but I will gladly repurchase another one without hesitation.
5312,1,"I love all their products!_The one thing I can depend on Neutrogena is to come out with skin products that make you feel good.  I've been using their soaps on and off since I was a teenager, and have never been disappointed.  The Naturals line is something new, and I was very curious to try it.  I have been using it the past week and I just love the way it feels.  It's a very light soap, lightly scented (not overpowering and not perfumey -it has more of a woodsy scent).  I use it once a day, at night (I use another Neutrogena product in the mornings) and while it is not harsh, I feel it is doing a good job with cleaning off residual makeup and dirt left on my skin after I have used my makeup remover.  I would definitely buy this product again.  Highly recommended."
9707,1,"Smells great and doesn't weigh down my hair_I have fine hair but a lot of it and I punish it with blow drying and styling tools.  Clear Scalp Nourishing Mask has restored some of the softness and shine but hasn't weighed my hair down the way some other deep conditioners have done in the past.  My hair still had volume but the shine and softness was much improved after only three uses.  I really like the scent, too; not too strong but very pleasantly fresh.  The improved texture lasted through a few washes (I only use this once/week)."
4254,1,"Best conditioner Ever_After discovering this brand and item over a year ago, this is the ONLY conditioner I use, and I mean the ONLY conditioner I use. I know the price tag is high, but let me tell you, if you have problems with every other conditioner you have ever used ever, than its really worth it :) I have long, fine straight hair which most people think is problem free, but the one area that has always given me problems is conditioner. No conditioner was ever enough to really moisturize or condition my hair, I feel like they wanted to provide some kind of half-baked detangling function, but actually nourishing my hair so it could reclaim its silky smooth consistency was never their priority, no matter how much I used, no matter what company I purchased from. I find most conditioners so drying, they are pumped full of alcohols and other ingredients that have nothing to do with actually preserving and caring for my hair but more about drying up and destroying it :( I had given up and was using different oils that I had found, which was better but left a bit of residue on my hair that I wasn't a fan of. This really saved, I mean saved my hair! I can use a little bit and it goes a long way. To really get the most out of it, I apply to my wrung hair while in the shower, and then let it sit as I go about and do other things for at least 15 minutes, this really solidifies the silkiness and the moisture content, but its NEVER greasy or heavy. I get so many compliments about my hair, and my hair is now consistently at the place that I would call its best. I'm not someone who runs after every brand name &#34;care item&#34; or who buys $35 lipstick. I pick my products based on ingredients (naturalness being a huge aspect) and how well they work for me. As I said this conditioner is pricey, but it is really is worth it, and I have purchased this conditioner before other things at times because it means that much to me. Its not just about the look which is super important, but the comfort of being able to brush my hair without getting into a traffic jam of knots, and with my hair being longer, super concentrated care is the only way for my hair to be cared for and not end up ragged and angry. So if you have any I mean ANY problems with other conditioners you have used, I would really give this a try. I recommend it for all hair types because its just so nourishing to any type of hair. It doesn't matter if its curly, poufy, or straight and slick, it will work, and it will make you remember how to love your hair again. &#60;3btw I should add, that using it carefully, (you really don't need alot, and massaging it into your hair, makes it go faarrr!) that one bottle usually lasts me at least a couple months, and my hair is pretty long at this point. So know that it's an investment, and it will really last. I think part of the price tag comes from ingredients from the rainforest, but I believe it is harvested sustainably and then the price is even more worthwhile."
5662,1,"Making It Easy to Dot!_Delivery was fast. Started using it the same day i received them. They all have different sizes and make perfect dots. I had been used to making dots with an item from home, once I used this product, I found it hard to make my dots from largest to smallest. After using this product several times I figured the best way to make the same effect."
3210,1,"love it_The best quality you could look for, i love the fact that it fits both hands/feet, i've had it for about 6 months now with no problems"
1491,1,"Love it!!!_I love this highlighter!! It is the perfect color, it gives you a really nice glow and shimmer. Great for the summer time but I've been using it for the winter as well cuz I love it so much! Would recommend to anyone!"
1870,1,"Great Product_SSSHHHH....don't let them know that the package says 20+ washes, but that is WAY OFF....I've been using it since summer on my size 7 feet and it is now November and I can just start feeling the &#34;soap bar&#34; is getting tiny in the middle...so I'll ask Santa for another one for Christmas."
6104,1,"I like the blue one the best!!!_I have been using this product for about a week. The blue clip fits better on my nose and is more comfortable. The pink clip really hurts, I guess i have to get used to it. I am an african american female with a wide nose. I have seen some changes within the week. I try to wear at least 30 minutes a day. I usually wear the clip for 30 minutes and then allow my nose to rest and wear it later in the day. So far..so good!!!"
6919,1,"Beautiful!_I adore this sexy girly color! It is soooo pretty; men and women alike have complimented me on it! OPI is one of my all-time favorite brands due to long-lasting wear, great coverage and resistance to chipping."
257,1,"Perfect_Essie's Fishnet Stocking is just perfect. It's red. It's not glittery, shimmer, or satiny... it's just RED. A very refreshing and no nonsense bold crayon-like red. It's approach to nail color is what I'm really loving about the Essie line. All Essie colors that I've tried are darker on your nails than in the bottle... consistently too. Like most of the other colors, this shade is heavily pigmented. My last 3 manicures were in this color. That's how much I love it. It's classic, it's basic, and it's not one of those shade you really had to be in a particular mood to wear. Best of all, I can wear it without being constantly reminded of Christmas."
5790,1,"Wife Loves It_Health and beauty products are difficult to review because it's nearly impossible to get empirical evidence to analyze efficacy.I don't use this stuff, but my wife does, and she swears by it. Most people think she's at least a decade younger than she is when they first meet her. Joanne has lived a life of relative moderation... no smoking or drugs ever, and sensible alcohol use... and maybe that has a lot to do with her youthful looks, but if you ask her, she will tell you that it's also because she takes care of her skin with this and a few other products."
1462,0,this is not my fragrance_i really like the wrapped with love but this one is wayy too woodsy for me. its just plain terrible. no more blind buys for me. my last few orders have been horrible. but if you like a strong woodsy smell. this is for you.
2969,1,"Firm :) Results_Unbelievable, but actually saw results in less than a week. Expensive, but not much moreso than products which claim the same but don't deliver.  This works!"
995,1,Skin feels great...._I have oily skin and this product makes my skin feel balanced and clean. I have seen a great improvement on my skin within a week. My skin just feels really great now after using this. I try to be consistent of using it daily for better results. I really like the fact that this product is natural and organic without harsh chemicals and ingredients found on other products.
9801,1,"Get a natural glow with InstaNatural Vitamin C serum_Vitamin C is one of the best things for your skin!  It can reduce the signs of aging, reduce discoloration, promote the skin's natural collagen and give you a nice, natural glow!  I have been using this in the morning before I put on my makeup.  I allow it to full dry (maybe do my hair while I wait) and then apply my makeup.  It has been a great barrier to help protect my skin from my makeup as well as providing a gentle glow that many of my friends and coworkers have commented on.  The aloe in this formula soothes my skin when irritated (I have recently used this on a sunburn and loved that it naturally cooled the area!).  I would recommend this over and over again!"
1056,1,Good price and good quality conditioner_This conditioner works well and it is very inexpensive. I would highly recommend it. The bottle is easy to use and lasts for a long time.
9938,1,"for soft hair_I have tried many products from this company and been impressed so I wasn't surprised when I tried this conditioner and loved it. My hair honestly feels so soft after using this conditioner. It is totally manageable and looks and feels so much better than it has in a long time. I live in a dry, desert climate and it makes my hair and skin so dry, but this conditioner is the answer! It washes out easily and also leaves my hair smelling nice (like a fresh scent). Don't let the Dead Sea Salt scare you, you won't look like a swamp monster...the properties in the Dead Sea products are amazing. You will NOT regret this purchase!"
1216,1,"Hard to Grip, but Good Stuff_This is really great stuff. The reason I'm not giving it five stars is the shape of the bottle. When I'm in the shower, it's really hard to grip while spraying this stuff in my hair. I had to buy a different spray bottle from the local drugstore and put it in there."
2478,1,"Beautiful Color!_Lubu Heels is a black polish with red micro-glitter in it.  Definitely needs two coats of application, otherwise the black will look see-through.  The overall effect is a polish that looks black from far away, but close up or in the sunlight the red glitter shimmers through.  It's a beautiful color, and unlike anything I have seen from other companies.  It did start to chip after 3 days, but I tend to be very hard on my nails so that is not unusual for me.  Definitely use a top coat over it to make it feel smooth to the touch!  Would highly recommend this color!"
4118,1,"Wow, I really like this!!!!_FYI, I have 50+ year old eyes.  They need all the help they can get.  This goes on moist and slick and holds the powders well.  It even has a bit of a foundation tint to it, so that helps with dark circles. It keeps my shadows from creasing or disappearing. Highly recommended."
226,1,The best!_Great cleanser.  Once you use it you won't use anything else.  It's my cleanser of choice.  Great product.  I'll buy it again and again.
6018,1,Protection for my hair...check!_Purchase this bonnet if you want something to protect your hair while you sleep. I also use a satin pillowcase but I put this over my wrap just to make sure that my hair is protected.
1205,1,"I love this stuff!!_This is best self-tanner I've ever used. I am extremely fair-skinned and this gives me the tan I had, naturally, in highschool. Not orangey, doesn't streak, doesn't smell. If I hadn't used it I wouldn't have believed it! Great product, worth the cost."
5649,1,"I like it_I didn't use them much, cause I got a lot of them. But as always, they work great. You need to see what works best for you on how to use it, but its a good product for an excellent price. After use, you can dip the top in nailpolish remover and the polish comes of right away."
457,1,"Smells delicious and works really well!_I've always gotten terrible hangnails -- so bad that they often bleed.  I've used hand lotions and creams to try to help, but I recently saw something in _Allure_ magazine about how great this Solar Oil is, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I love it!Since it is a bit messy, I've been applying it right before bed.  I put a bit on each nail, and massage it around the cuticle area and entire nail bed.  When I wake up, it has sunk in, and it leaves my nails and cuticles nicely moisturized -- much more so than just using regular hand lotion. It's helping to heal up my hangnails.The smell on this is also divine.  It smells like almond cookies.  Great product that I will definitely re-purchase!"
5118,1,"Fabulous product, but use with caution_This is the only polish-type treatment that has ever really made a significant difference in my peeling nails.  When I started using it in conjunction with Solar Oil on my cuticles, my nails looked even better.  Beware, though; it contains formaldehyde as well as a host of other toxic chemicals. When you wear the polish, you are absorbing those chemicals through your nails, and every time you eat with your hands, you're eating them too.  If you prepare food, hand your dog a treat, etc., you're getting small amounts of formaldehyde in everything, and this is obviously not an ingredient that you want your family or your dog eating.  I highly recommend this product for its results, but I think the chemicals are dangerous.  Once your nails are repaired, you might want to switch to a nail product that is less injurious to your health.  Solar Oil is not toxic, and it strengthens nails by repairing your cuticles.  The health food store has nail products without toxic chemicals.  Everything toxic you consume and absorb goes to your liver."
3973,1,Makeup bag must!_I love this for foundation distribution! I just dab foundation on the back of my hand. Then I dip the brush in it and dot a couple on my forehead. Then cheeks (one dot on each). A dab on my nose and chin. Then go back over the entire face with the brush (don't add more foundation). Keep making a circular motion over your dots. It blends beautifully! I finish off with Loreal Transluscent Powder! Gorgeous!
7293,1,"Great 2 in 1_Normally my husband uses whatever shampoo that is within reach while in the shower.He tried this 2 in 1 Anti Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, it lathered up nicely.Years back when I purchased 2 in 1 anti dandruff shampoo and conditioner, it did not lather and reminded me of like school glue (if that makes sense)This was not like that at all.Removed all of his hair product residue from his hair and left his hair soft, shiny and very clean looking and healthy looking.Like this product and the results.The scent is not over powering in my opinion and I think a woman could use this as well and not have to worry about the scent being too much."
782,1,"Good for the Big Boys_I purchased this to sharpen my Sog Machete, Fiskars Axe and my Axes from SOG.  Works very, very well.  I was able to get some 'dings' out of the blades which I thought were there for life.  Very easy to use.  Keep it wet during use and wash when you are done.  Sharped all of my tools to a razor blade.....or back to new status.  Very pleased.  I should say that I have never used one of these before and they work great!  The stone is two sided, one is rougher and the other is smoother.  Rough side first then the smoother side to finish."
7114,1,"Cosplay costume addition_Bought this for my daughter to use for her cosplay character.  Not really what I thought it would be, can't really do anything with it, other than it just lays there on her head. Next time I will order another brand and see how that turns out."
44,1,"GREAT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN_I've been using this product for a several years. At first I used it on my face and neck, but as I got older, I needed a creamier moisturizer for my face as my skin became drier. I still buy this for my neck though. I've seen women with really wrinkly necks, so far mine is OK.I have ultra sensative skin, this Olay doesn't hurt when I put it on, I like the fact that it has SPF 15 which helps a little bit to protect my skin from the sun. If I'm going to be out in the sun for a long time, I use a different product, with a high number, SPF 30 to 50.When I ordered this, I thought it was the larger size, so when it arrived, I was a bit disappointed. I bought another one exactly the same, in this size at Walmart a few days ago, it only cost $5, I paid $6 here on here Amazon, it's good to shop around.I would recommend this for those who are just beginning to use a moisturizer."
9967,1,"Incredible Value for the Price!_I am a fan of clay masks because they make my skin feel soft, smooth, and &#34;detoxed.&#34;  The clay masks I have used in the past, however, were pre-formulated in a tube which seems to only work great for the first or second time that you use the tube.  Then, suddenly, the tube gets harder and harder to squeeze the product out; making your purchase both frustrating and a waste of money.  This is not the case with Best Bentonite Clay as use mix JUST WHAT YOU NEED AT THE TIME, and the rest of the powdered clay stays fresh for you to use in the future.  You mix the powdered clay with water and apply - simple as that. Don't be fooled by the size of the jar - this will last you a long, long time as you don't need much powder per mask.  It feels refreshing and great to use - feels like I'm treating myself to something special.  I definitely recommend this product.  The value is incredible if you compare this to the price of the pre-mixed Murad clay mask product - you will be glad that you bought Best Bentonite Clay instead!"
4328,1,"Revlon colorstay mineral finishing powder,suntan matte_I love,love ,love this powder.I saw the review on a youtube channel and decided to try it out.It was everything and more as described by the reviewer.It gives a lovely healthy glow.Its quite unfortunate that the item has been discontinued by Revlon.This is a keeper."
7935,0,"Makes a huge frizz ball.._This flat iron was ok for the price, but after about 5 uses it started to work opposite. Instead of making my hair smooth it was making them so frizzy, very dry looking. I had to apply bunch of products and none of them could kill the frizz.Each time I've tried it got worse, maybe defective, maybe some coating came off, maybe it doesn't work for fine highlighted hair.It makes hair straight with no problems, heats up quite fast, has a temperature controller and it's not heavy/bulky.I just tried GHD Candy flat iron/ styler and it smoothed my hair instantly with 1 stroke. There is only 1 temperature setting, which I like and it heats up in 2 seconds, smaller, sleeker and fun color. Expensive but makes my hair look good."
5185,1,Just like picture_Was fast to get and was just like the picture in the default and also does the job very well
4374,1,non-latex ok._After I purchased these I discovered they were latex. I have no problem with latex but beware if you do.
3057,1,"Effective_This is a very efficient product from rRemington. Works like a charm, takes less time compared to my older version from Remington. Also true to its name, there is more shine. Recommended."
3717,1,I love this gloss_For my skin color and lip color this is the perfect neutral. This also looks great on top of some of my lip sticks and stains. Great product.
289,1,"Great post surgery body oil_I bought this to apply to my four post surgery incisions. Not straight away of course, but once the skin has knitted together, this oil works well for softening the skin and I think it helps with the healing process too."
5621,1,Love this salt_I Love this stuff I use it in my foot baths and bath salt making just really great salt.^_^
4653,1,Gorgeous colors but very small_Love the color pallette. Perfect range of colors and matte vs shimmer. I only wish it was bigger for the $$$ since this is a dupe of the 'Naked' by Urban Decay. Oh and the lip glosses aren't great but the shadows make up for it
8696,1,"Very gentle cleansing_I am very pleased with these wipes. For those who have problems with fragrance, you will be happy to know you won't have to worry about that, either.When I first opened the pack and used one, it was so gentle that I thought it wasn't doing anything to remove my makeup and cleanse my face. However, when I looked at the wipe after I swiped it over my face a few times, I was amazed to see just how good a job it really did.It removed all my makeup without harsh chemicals or scrubbing and I highly recommend these wipes for those with sensitive skin."
7044,1,"Compared to Olay Total Effects CC Cream_I normally useOlay CC Cream, but Garnier was less expensive, so I thought I'd try it.  My first impression was it's much thicker than Olay, and there's mild tingling as I'm applying it.  It looks like I just put a thick layer of foundation on (I apply liberally, as instructed on the label). On the positive side, my skin tone is completely evened out.  Splotches don't show.I'm happy for the SPF 15 protection, but I'm not feeling the moisturizing effects.  It's not a bad BB cream, but I don't care for the thickness and tingling.  It's just not Olay CC. 3 1/2  stars."
4446,1,"This is the newest hottest thing!!!_I love my deep waver, its awesome if you want sexy beach waves! I'm a hairdresser, so I'm always looking for the latest and greatest thing. You can't go wrong with this item, you'll love it! This seller was great, they shipped it out right away, and it was brand new! If you have any questions on how to use this item, I recommend you tubing it. They have lots of tutorials to show you what the results look like. Have fun creating new styles! God Bless &lt;3"
2318,1,"UFO of Cleanliness!_I gotta say up front, I was skeptical; the picture didn't quite sell me on the concept. But I just got out of the shower, and this item worked FAR BETTER than my old, standard shower puff/wash cloth team up. The soft lather side isn't too soft, but works far better than a standard puff, and the scouring side really helped with my feet, elbows and other choice parts than need dead skin sloughed off. Both sides are aided by the rubber grip witch fits perfectly in my hand (and hopefully will extend the life of the puffy part, as it is wrapped around the inner part and has dimples for a perfect grip. I really recommend this thing to guys, and gals to boot. Get it!"
1169,1,"Amazing._These sponges are amazing!!!!! I bought these to apply my liquid foundation and it works miracles! I've previously been using makeup brushes and I saw these online and they had rave reviews. I must say, the hype is true. It made my foundation go on so much smoother, no streaks and the finish was amazing.  You soak this pink sponge in water and then squeeze it out. It doubles in size and will be slightly damp for application.  You basically just stipple and roll this over your face and it evenly distributes the foundation and makes an utterly flawless finish. I've been raving about this to my sister.  It worth the price and Amazon had the best price that I could find anywhere. Its worth it."
878,1,"Not only for very dry chemically processed hair_When I got it out of box and saw 'for very dry chemically processed hair' written on a jar I did not think it will work for me.I guess I should have examined product image closer because it was not mentioned in product description anywhere.So to start with I did not have high expectations.I used it three times now and this conditioner is great.I have average normal long straight hair,not dyed or processed,just ends tend to get little dry and I was looking for something to help with that.After using this conditioner my hair looks healthier,it's shiny, manageable and now has more volume because it holds up longer after styling."
8582,1,Great Product_This is a great product for nails only! You just need to press on the nail and hold it. Works great!
9202,1,dense small glitter_This is areally beautiful color.  It is clear polish full of orange amd pink glitter.  Covers completely in three coats for an orange look.  If you add a fourth coat it becomes much more pink.  Either way it makes a coral impression.  Looks great over other  olors and as an accent nail.
4654,1,"Fabulous! Product + Customer Service!_I love this little NYX Nude on Nude Natural Look Kit!Perfect for travel or just keeping it compact!Colors are gorgeous and NYX is quality on a budget!Don't need anything else, just add mascara! =)THANKS NYX Cosmetics USA, Inc. ! YOUR AWESOME!"
1587,1,very nice_This delivered pretty quickly. I was anxious to try it out since I had already been using the pressed powder. The foundation does last a long time on my face. It looks very natural and smooth. I don't have to worry about constantly re-applying my pressed powder because my foundation has faded away. Much better than drug store brands. The tube was about twice the size I had expected. Seems that it will last a good 2-3 months with daily use. My only complaint is I do not think it is worth $30-$40. I can see paying around $20 for it. I will decide once I use the whole tube if I will continue to buy.
3253,0,No Expiration Date_It took almost 3 weeks for me to receive this product because it somehow got stuck in the post office (I literally live in the same state that this item was shipped from). When I finally did receive the item it had no expiration date. For all I know this thing could already be expired and I don't know. I ordered the almond and sesame version of this oil from ebay and did not have this problem. I guess I'll be ordering all my hair oils from there from now on.
9064,1,"Another great product from Savanaah_I really like this company's products.  I loved their argan oil and I love this eye cream.  First off, their products are packaged beautifully.  They really make perfect gifts for women (and men if the men in your life like taking care of themselves).Secondly, the quality of their products are really fantastic.  I looked up every ingredient listed on this eye cream on EWG.org and all of them have been rated as extremely safe except for one, that is rated moderate.  When it comes to eye creams, that's a miracle.  Usually, eye creams are so full of chemicals I feel like I'm giving myself skin cancer when I use them.  With this product, I can use it without the guilt and the worry.Finally, it actually works.  I don't know about reducing wrinkles, etc., because that is so hard to judge.  But I do know that it makes my eye area feel quite good and I actually feel like its nicely moisturized and not cracking every time I smile.Overall, a fantastic product.I received a sample for review."
9088,1,"Very cool_Love this polish. It dries matte but with the glitter it still has a fun, sparkly effect. High gloss + glitter may be a little too much for me. This is a perfect polish for someone who is afraid to do black as it doesn't look &#34;goth&#34; or someone who is skittish about glitter. A more grown-up version of glitter if you will."
7516,1,"Good price for a good brush_I needed a push eyeliner brush but didn't want to pay the prices I was finding at my local stores. I'm a cheapskate! Anyway, being cheap paid off this time, because this brush works perfectly (great shape to it, easy to hold).I will definitely buy this brand again!"
7283,1,"So Cute_Love this wig, came neatly packaged and in very good condition. Fits great, well made and comfortable. I bought this wig as a way to decide if I wanted to change my hair color but I like the wig so much I just want to wear it all the time :)"
953,1,"Works for me_I scrub twice daily with the bristle end and use the sponge and cream once a week. My face is soft and so much cleaner feeling!I live in the hot humid south and it seems like my face was holding in a lot of sweaty greasy dirt, this has helped immensely. Yippee"
9972,1,double thumbs up_This serum is great!! It has a special ingredient that is getting very popular in many serums and creams. The ingredient is the dead sea mineral found in the waters of the dead sea. The salts from the dead sea are believed to treat or heal different symptoms of different diseases and dermatological issues. No wonder why people flock to the dead sea each year and rant and rave about it. they even have offices all around the dead sea that use the same minerals to treat a lot of things that are believe to work wonders. The products benefits you with the natural minerals. It leaves you with an instant lift and benefits long term on your face by stopping the aging process and reversing it. After using it my face was smooth and soft and didnt feel oily or sticky. It was super light weight and doesn't interfere with any makeup routine you may have. After the time ive use it my face truly feels radiant. LOVE LOVE LOVEdouble thumbs up!!!!!!
4434,1,"almayy_Not sure what the dial on the tube even does to be honest, think its just for show. This mascara is great though, I really like the brush and a good price!"
5552,1,So much better than glitter nail polish!_I used this as an accent nail along with Essie's Play Date. All my fingers were in the play date color and then my index finger on each hand had these frock star strips.It last me almost a week before it started to peel away (but I type a lot with work and wash my hands a ton through the day).
7626,1,"love_shipped well, came early and love all hunger games polishes, mix it with other old nail polishes makes fun for kids"
3200,1,Perfect for all hair types!_I have had a bunch of friends try this product (it's my second time purchasing) and nothing matches this particular one due to the fine atomizing mist that it outputs as well as the sheen it gives without weighing down the hair. I definitely recommend and I use it daily.
7952,1,"It works on young men!_I have two males in the family, and both have sensitive skin.  So I typically buy something scentless for them, but when I saw this I thought I'd give it a try.  One has dry skin and the other is a bit 'stinky' most of the time.  Both require as few products as possible, so this fits the bill covering both face and body.They are both telling me they like it.  Not love, like, which is the best they can do.  No complaints - they like the way it smells (manly!) and it rinses well.  No sticky residue, and no itching after the shower."
9680,1,LOVE THIS!_This serum has a delightful smell. It goes on super easy and absorbs very fast.  Takes literally seconds to apply and doesnt leave a greasy feeling at all. It also after about a week of use makes your skin look great! For me it helps with dryness and i love it~!
4895,1,Ilex_I love this hair steamer. I felt it helps my hair retain more shine and luster after I use it with my deep conditioners.It also works as a great steamer for the face.
2338,1,Wen_love how this makes my hair feel healthier and soft without the extra weight.....I bought some as a gift also
3326,1,"Gentle, Cleans very well_I don't think I've ever had an exfoliator that has been this gentle and cleaned this well at the same time. I can't say enough good things about it. I'll list it's attributes to make it easy for your purchasing decision:-Gentle (as described above)-Effective in cleaning out black heads from medium--large pores-Smells great-A little bit goes a very long way. (I dab a couple spots on my forehead, cheeks, jaw, temples and chin then wet my hands and lightly rub) I believe this full sized tube will last me quite a while since a little sample tube of it lasted me about 2 months.Did I mention that it smells great? lol. Yes I did, but it's also holistic, which makes me feel better about using it on my skin. Fantastic product and well worth the price."
867,1,"Nice little boost_I don't drink coffee and barely have any soda and don't touch energy drinks but needed something to give me a little pick me up in the morning. These caffeine pills did the trick. Equivalent to a Starbucks coffee caffeine content which I wouldn't be able to meet with soda at home, nor would I want to. My husband works graveyard and tried them out since he can only drink so much coffee and wouldn't you know it, he took the bottle to work. So I'm back to buy another bottle to stay at home. :)"
4947,1,"rose garden_nice slightly deeper red with matte finish , no glitter. I like it and can't wait to use it with all the top coat shine!"
5689,1,feels good_Very nice smooth feeling after application.  I do blot with a tissue to remove excess color and blend.  I put a bit of moisturizer on top to smooth and keep a fresh look.  It does leave skin even colored.
4115,1,ONLY 5 PCS_ITS NICE BUT THERE ARE ONE BRUSH MISSING ONLY I RECEIVED 5 PCS ONLY .. ... ... ... ... ..
7187,1,"Takes a little practice, but cool patterns!_Stick on nail polish isn't new, but Sally Hansen has some really cool designs, which would easily cost me a fortune at a nail salon. I tried the Love Letter pattern (see pictures). It takes a little practice, some of my edges look slightly ragged in spots at my nail bed/sides of nails, but I have very narrow nails, so they went over the edge just a bit for me. It took me about 15 minutes, the only down side is there is no good way to store the extras, if they dry out, they don't work AT ALL. I suggest using warm hands (as instructed) and I use my fingers to smooth the strips down, then I stretch/bend them over the edge of my nail, then gently file off the excess. I finished with a top coat (I used the Sally Hansen Diamond Flash fast drying top coat). The first set I tried, I had a base coat on and that was a really bad idea, they didn't stick very well at all. This second set seems to be holding up better, I started with clean, dry nails that I had swiped over with polish remover to make sure there was no lotion residue or anything on my nail. The busier patterns would be much easier to patch with other pieces if you tear it in spots. Also, if you have shorter nails, you really could use one set, and cut them in half, to get two sets from one package, it would just require that you get really good at trimming the excess off your nails."
9123,1,"Great disposable razor specially the trimmer part_The razor feels and works like any other disposable triple blade razor, but the bikini trimmer that goes on the top of the regular razor, makes the product outstanding. It is a good trimmer for other body parts too, for those times when it&#8217;s a good idea to trim the area before shaving it. For instance, after a long winter, where we didn&#8217;t display that much skin and might have neglected the shaving of some areas too. I like this razor size very much, because it&#8217;s easy to pack for travel and one doesn&#8217;t have to bring it back, being made to be disposed of after being used."
9517,1,"Good choice for normal hair_The shampoo and conditioner that I have used for the last few years has recently changed their formula and it no longer provides the moisture that I need.  I have now begun shopping for a new favorite product.  While I enjoy this one because it has a nice scent, it does not provide the amount of moisture that I need.  I have tried almost this entire line because it is comparable to pureology within their description.  I don't know if that is true.  While pureology is too expensive for me to buy on a regular basis, it does have a tendency to give my fair, limp hair bounce.  This does not.  It is a little too thin and doesn't give me the moisture and volume that I would prefer.  On the plus side, it does not dry my hair out either.  This would be perfect for someone with normal hair that wants a daily conditioner."
7236,0,"ok_They are ok, not the best.  But not the worst either. I'm not going to buy them again sorry. Kinda cheap."
5471,1,"Not bad_I like that it comes with 2 cases.  Not sure if I am seeing a difference with my hair after a few months of use.  Also after the 3rd wash a seam ripped so I now have a hole in it.  Other than it being wrinkled post washing, the satin itself has held up nicely and I do enjoy the feeling of it."
5607,0,"Too Heavy for My Skin_I must say, for Clearasil, this product left me disappointed. I personally have light acne, flaring up occasionally; three or four times a year. What drew me to this product was the fact that it acted both as a wash and a mask, as well as the pleasant scent.After using the the product for about a week, I no longer wish to use it further. It actually left my skin feeling dry and irritated; not clean and smooth. When I used the product as a wash, it didn't foam, leaving me second guessing whether or not I dispensed enough onto my palm.I would also like to point out that the cap is not made well. It broke this morning when closing the cap. Please, save your money and buy a different product."
4760,1,"Very versatile!_I love the blushes and they are very good for a variety of skin tones. The lip colors - are average at best and do not last long at all, very sheer with little color depth. The shadows are very nice and I love the variety of greys, plus a couple grey greens."
3195,1,Five Stars_Love these!!!!!
2950,1,"BUY BUY BUY!!!_I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM!!!!!!!!!!!I read a lot of reviews before buying these in hope they will be okay. For Approx $15, they are fantastic and I adore my brushes. They have every brush I require, the handles are sturdy and the wood & finish on them isn't chipped.People on here have gone on about the 'smell' of them. Don't worry, it's just a 'new factory' kind of smell and i wasn't bothered by it at all. The pouch is soft and in 100% good condition.The bristles themselves are a lot better than i expected. Some malt bristles occasionally and they are fairly soft (they aren't going to be the softest you've ever bought, you need to be logical when its $15 ) but I own a $70.00 Kabuki brush and even that occasionally malts bristles and loses its softness after a while.I HIGHLY recommend buying these for any home make up use. Professionally, probably not; however, as a starter kit or spare kit absolutely!"
6137,1,great_great wheel and handy storage that allows you to open and close easily I am happy with all the shapes
4492,1,Works as intended_I bought this for my girl friend in additional to her nice collection.  She goes through this stuff like a sock.  Hopefully this will last a bit longer.  So far so good I think.
7588,0,Didn't like this product_Didn't like this product Bc the brushes are not good quality and the brushes are flimsy and weak and I think it's only good for nail polish removing if messed up :-/
6163,1,"High quality eye cream_Last year a rep introduced me to the entire Image brand line.  This specific Eye Creme (MAX) definitely has the quality.  This is the 1st time I've tried the &#34;Max&#34; eye creme (I usually use the 'Vital C' line of this brand), but I went out on a limb.  One of the 1st things I do after waking up is look at my face in the mirror.  I immediately reach for this eye creme.  One full pump for me is enough for both eyes.  The bags and lines tighten up well, and it has a fragrance to die for.  Over the years I have tried a dozen (no exaggeration) different under eye creams,serums, etc.  Honestly I still haven't found one to commit to.  But this one is very close to being perfect.  Image is excellent brand, high quality and worth using (check out their Vital C line)."
2066,1,Excellent Treatment for Dry Hands_I read about this cream while reviewing another person's review and decided to purchase a tin of it.  You'd be surprised how much more you can learn about an item by reading customers' reviews.iSo I ordered a small tin of it and received it overnight!  I will say that this cream works well and I am very pleased with how well it works on parched hands!  I wish they also had a body cream.Highly recommend this product to anyone who has dry parched hands.
9741,1,Great job_This shampoo and conditioner does a great job of getting my husbands hair clean. He tends to have a lot of product build up and this 2 in 1 product thoroughly cleans and conditions his hair. We both enjoy the scent of it as well.
9549,0,"not very effective_I have been trying to find a decent, cheap dry shampoo product.  This one is definitely cheap, but I don't think it's very effective. I did notice added volume and softness to my hair immediately after.  However,my hair started to fall flat and look a bit on the greasy side about 8 hours after I used it.  This was only one day after I had washed it. I was hoping it would absorb better than it does.the smell didn't bother me like it did others.  It was a bit of a chemical smell, but no worse than hairspray."
6363,1,"Sooooo gorgeous!!!!_I'm addicted to blush and I can't believe it's taken me this long to purchase a Benefit powder! Most of my blushes are bright pinks and corals and I was in the market for something a little different. I'm really really glad I settled on the Hervana blush. It's actually one I haven't seen in stores, so I was taking a chance based on product reviews from bloggers. The consensus was that this particular color (or colors, if you will) works with any skin tone. I'm fairly light with yellow undertones and this blush looks absolutely fabulous on me! It's a very beautiful dusty orchid pink that looks fresh and radiant. It gives me a really beautiful fresh flush that makes me glow! It's not too sparkly, so it's fantastic for day and has awesome staying power on my combo skin.The brush it comes with is so soft and is a fantastic angled brush. I was surprised since most brushes that come with blush are rather useless and I end up using them for cleaning jewelry or my makeup area, but this brush I will definitely be using!I'm so happy with this product...I think my other blushes might not get much use now!"
4490,1,"Awesome liner!_When they say this is fat, they mean it! The tip is about the same size as a Super Sharpie. There is plenty of pigment and I've had no issues with dry-out. It does take a little bit of getting used to to create lines of different thicknesses. It seems to last all day, but does smudge easily. Will definitely purchase again!"
8284,1,"Pleasantly surprised. Visible lightweight shine and very inexpensive._I used the Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Shampoo for the first time last night. Honestly, I didn't have great expectations. I was pleasantly surprised.Typically when a hair care product has oil in it my hair ends up shiny, but greasy-shiny. I have used Moroccan oil in my hair before and I might has well have poured a bottle of cooking oil on it. Anyway, this product did what it said it would do. My hair was shinier than it was with the shampoo I was using before. I'm anxious to see what it does over time and also if it is in actuality color-safe. My hair stylist has said never to use cheap shampoo and to always insure that whatever I use that it is color-safe. We shall see.For now, I was pleasantly surprised. I read reviews about the scent being super strong. I am typically sensitive to scents and I really didn't mind it and actually hardly noticed it. I would say it the scent is closest to almond essence/oil. It really wasn't strong at all. You can't beat the price!"
8815,1,Great alternative to other foundations!_This item gives great coverage and allows for quick application.  It also allows for skin renewal and promotes healthy skin.
1815,1,"Pretty cool :)_i love it, it dries quite fast, leaves your nails looking nice and glossy, easy to peel off so don't do that lol, i scratch my nails when i'm nervous."
9216,1,"5 stars for this_It cleans and tones.  Softly.  The sheets could be softer, but look at the price and quantity compared to Ponds!  I would buy these again.  I am a fan of towelettes.  I've been using them for 5 years, and people think I have great skin.  Every once in awhile I will get a professional facial.  Maybe once a year. Highly recommended.  I have the vitamin C ones, and they smell and feel great!"
8339,1,"Jokes on Me_I actually got this for my husband as a joke. As mid 30 and 40 year olds, we tend to laugh at the ridiculousness that is Axe advertising. We are certainly not their focus group. However, I thought 'Why not?'The outcome is even better. My 9 year old daughter who is already experiencing some small outbreaks and greasy skin, wanted to use the 'cool new blue stuff' to wash her face.After she did, her face was smooth and she smelled so clean and nice! After 5 days, there isn't any shine on her skin and the tiny breakout bumps were gone. There isn't a lot of soapy suds when in use, it smells REALLY REALLY minty and very much lives up to the 'chilling' claim. You can certainly feel the cool tinglys on your face when you are using it and even a little after.So after getting it as a joke, my husband and daughter really enjoy it."
181,1,Five Stars_love the color and it stays on long.
806,0,Didnt work_Very sad that i didnt get amazing results. I would actually leave this in my hair for longer than two minutes and it still did not help any. My hair is so rough and horrible split ends i dont know what to do. I will def not repurchase this!
111,0,Not worth it_Ended up selling this at a garage sale for $2.  It didn't work very well at all.  Would not recommend.
5418,1,"Great dry shampoo for a great price_Really good dry shampoo. Works well, though I found it needs to be rubbed in a little more than the other got2b dry shampoo. Still good and can't beat the price. Arrived quickly and well packaged."
4573,1,"A product I actually see a difference in!_I got a sample of this from my distributor (I'm a stylist of 22 years) and I am one of those stylists that prefers clean, product free, healthy hair but since it was a sample I took it home for myself and gave it a shot. WOW! My hair stays clean feeling and you would never know there was anything in it other than bounce, shine and softness. I have fine, curly hair that tends to be more frizzy than curly and I have to flat iron or curl my hair to make it smooth looking. With this I have been able to blowdry with a round brush and go. I get more complements than ever. The weird thing is my hair stays in place but feels like there is nothing holding it. My co-worker and I went to theme part this past weekend and she made the comment, 'OMG how is your hair still perfect after that rollercoaster?' lol  I have no idea what is different about this product over the hundreds I've tried over the years, but I don't do reviews unless something really strikes a cord with me. I doubt it would be a miracle product for ALL hair types, but it sure is for mine."
9208,1,Opi San Francisco Collection Fall& Winter 2013 in the Cable Carpool_Very pretty new 2013 Fall and Winter collection this color is purplish just like  the picture shows only used two coats and a top coat  looks pretty on
7855,1,"It's do the job_Carls daughter, first time using it and it's good, but I don't like the Smell. It's not a bad smell but not a good on either"
368,1,"NICE!!!_Want something that smells delicious? Well This is it..don&#8217;t look any further, I can remember this fragrance back in the day and I haven&#8217;t seen it in a long time until I was shopping for the older colognes. I put this cologne up there with DKNY, Gucci, Eternity, BCBG and Betsy Johnson&#8230;I love this stuff&#8230;they don&#8217;t make them like they use to but this one right here is a classic."
6788,1,"Works_Not the best smell in the world, definitely smells like tanning lotion, but it works and it's a great price. See results every time I use it, several shades darker, and not orange. I'll probably buy it again as it's about 1/4 of the price of the lotion I was using before."
3308,1,Make your Bkt last longer!_I do my own keratin treatments at home for my daughter and I. I use this conditioner once a week to revamp my hair. I feel like it really helps my hair keep its soft texture like I just had a treatment again for the first time. I use Aubrey organics so the need to use the conditioner everyday would be a waste.
728,1,"Sun Self Tanning Lotion Ultra Dark Instand Tint_Very easy to apply, and much safer than tanning outside!  Exfoliating is important before you apply this product, I also use the Sun Goddess Mitt to apply this to my body.  No streaking, no orange color, I really like it on my face.  It gives me a great color and allows me to wear sleeveless tops in the early spring and it looks like I have been to the tanning beds a few times...Great coverage does not rub off on your sheets and I highly recommend this product for a healthy tan glow."
7145,1,"Good product_I really like this masque, it did leave my hair very soft.  It smells good.  I rarely have time to use this, because it recommends to put it on your hair and leave on for 5 minutes.  a shower cap is definitely necessary.  I will save this for when I have the time and want to pamper myself.  Works well though."
2474,1,Five Stars_Excellent product...
493,1,"if you like purple_If you like purple I bet you will love this color, it screams summer time. I already used it and I like It a lot, amazing to enlarge your nail polish collection."
3925,1,"good buy_The color of this lip stick is beautiful. It stays on for a long time and definitely makes a statement. The only thing that bothers me is that when you apply the product it can be streaky. Other than that, I do not regret purchasing it and would definitely buy another one."
1057,1,"Can't find anymore!_I am having a very hard time finding this stuff!  I love it but I have had to start using other products as this is no longer sold in stores and getting harder to find on amazon.  If you use it according to directions and sparingly, it works great! I like it better with subtle lights and not chunky which is something you can control.  Hope amazon keeps selling it."
5068,1,"Bounce, bounce, baby!!!!!!!_Bought flat iron & hair serum together after seeing products at the local shopping mall & refusing to pay that much. I have virgin(13 yrs) african american hair,that I usually press & flat iron. After using the HerStyler I have no need to press & flat iron ever and its so shiny and bouncy. So amazing!! Where have u been all my life??"
8019,1,"Flirt-able lashes_I've used Covergirl products for years.  I'm pleased with this mascara.  It really is a Clump Crusher!  There's nothing worse than clumps of mascara joining 2 or 3 lashes together.  The curved, plastic brush is easy to use and keeps lashes defined.  My eyes look great behind my glasses.  I recommend Covergirl Clump Crusher.It's not just for girls - I haven't been a girl for decades but still like to use natural looking eye makeup.  I think it's almost more important as I've gotten older so I don't look faded or cranky.Well done Covergirl."
5013,0,"major pore clogger_to be fair, I have yet to find a primer that doesn't clog pores.this product line is carried by a fellow aesthetician so I gave this a try.  their spf is great!"
9674,1,"Valentia Even Glow Serum Makes My Face Happy_I've been using various serums, and when I started Valentia Even Glow Serum, I discovered my face continuing to improve in appearance. Some dark freckles have faded out, no acne to contend with, and my facial skin is smooth, clean, and beautiful. It&#8217;s incredibly easy to use, too&#8211;simply place a few drops on your fingertips and use generously on face and neck after you&#8217;ve used a regular cleanser and toner, and before applying moisturizer.I really love Valentia Even Glow Serum, and it makes my face happy. Highly recommended product."
6556,1,Good_I gave it 4 stars because I thought scrapper doesn't remove all the extra polish from the plate. It can be because it's the first time I've ever done nail stamping. i will change my review as soon as I learn how to do it correctly.
6657,1,Same as in stores_I needed an extra stamper and thought that the clear would help me see the stamps a  little better and its the same as the pink stampers.  It works good and picks up the design.
1084,0,"Acidic Smell_I've used this before but it had been a while. It does have a decent hold that allows for touch and movement, but I didn't remember the strong acidic smell I notice now. I have a hard time using it because when I'm out and catch the smell off and on it reminds me of ammonia or my cat's litter box smell."
7885,1,Nice quality_Really like these they are nice and heavy not cheaply made at all .. love them and glad that i bought them
5207,1,"NYX Eye Brow Push-Up Bra,_NYX Eye Brow Push-Up Bra, is very good. And the color is fantastic. Loved it! is my favorite.I recommend to everyone."
9910,1,"Great Facial Sponge I ever used!_When I first recieved the package, it was nicely boxed in a brown, natural, and earthy like box, which goes perfectly with the theme of the product. The color of course is black as charcoal, and since it uses Bamboo Charcoal it is known to give a much deeper cleaning for the skin.The directions are simple and makes it easy to use. Just soak the sponge till it's soft, than massage on the face in a circular motion. The cool part is that you don't have to use a facial cleanser if you don't want too. I figure, I'd try to use the Konjac Sponge with and without a facial product.Here are my results:Without A Facial Cleanser - I could feel a great exfoliating of the Konjac Sponge on the face. It actually help remove more of that dirt and oil from my pores on my T-zone. Afterwards, I notice my skin looking brighter and I didn't have to use vitamin c to get a natural glow!  It actually did make my face feel refreshed and the most important part, it made my face feel CLEAN!With A Facial Cleanser -  When I tried to use the Konjac Sponge with a facial cleanser, I notice that the sponge helped deep dig into the pores and I felt as if the cleanser was  reaching deep into the skin, allowing for a better and greater clean than just facial cleanser alone. The sponge helps deep clean, while the cleanser removes what comes up to on the skin and penetrates further in the pores.I absolutely love how my skin felt with both methods and think you will too. Compared to those natural sea sponges you can get at the drugstore or any Walmart, I get a better result with the Konjac Sponge with Bamboo Charcoal.Finally, my face did appear smoother, softer and cleaner. Therefore, this is one product I'd tell anyone who wants to clean those pores out, stop acne from occurring, and have a natural glow."
8070,1,"Wonderful_Not only does this product smell great, it's perfect for daily moisture without weighing hair down. As a curly haired girl, I'm forever looking for such a conditioner, but it looks like I won't have to look anymore!"
1476,1,"Good product_I first used this product in 2006 after a friend of mine with armpit length afro hair suggested it to me. She would probably have 3c type hair. She would use it in combination with Redken Anti-snap. I do not know the details of what shampoo or conditioner she used.To blow dry, she used high heat with a paddle brush and then used a GHD flat iron. I prefer to allow my hair to air dry for about 5 mins after applying the leave ins. I then use low heat in combination with a detangling brush primarily when very wet. Once 50% dry, I use the paddle brush to smooth the hair down (in sections). Following this, I use my GHD or High Shine Remington Flat Iron (no higher than 190C) and do this process only once a week - 2 weeks. I've been looking for other alternative leave ins but so far have needed to use more than one (mixing Macademia Healing oil, Giovanni's Frizz be gone and a heat protectant). I tried Aphogee's Leave In Spray and Neutrogena Triple Silk Leave in and they did nothing for my head of hair. Quite frankly, I notice a difference when drinking more water (as a general rule and taking supplements. I would say drinking 2-3 L of water a day (under a gallon) is highly recommended.One supplement which is key for many women in growing their hair is Mineral Rich Liquid supplement with or without Aloe. Minimize your processed sugar/carb content and watch the difference in your hair."
7768,1,niiiiiice_very nice eyeshadow i just received it and i couldnt stop smiling when i was putting it on..i was eveen dancing too thats how beautiful it is...trust me you will love this product if you buy it looks just like the pic in a nice beautiful container
57,1,"love it great lift for dark hair eliminates red_lightenes my choc brown hair like 4 - 5 shades to a light brown with shimmering golden hi lites doesn't look red. I love this stuff. don't want blonde but lighter brown as im over 40 and dark hair makes me look older. kinda got the color that Jacqueline Smith has ( ths spokeslady for kmart clothes, former charlies angels# her hair is lighter brown wth blonde hi lites. # not dark like when she was a charlies angell. I love this. ppl complimented on it. its my fav, normal color now. I don't go to the salon anymore and ppl think I do.! I have used other hair colors from a box that turned my hair red/ orange or auburn. this feria colors my dark hair to a light brown with hi lites, as I want. some people think I go to a salon and get it professionally done. I have gotten compliment. thanks  this is the only stuff I use now. (PS- I put saran wrap over my head to help with processing my dark brown hair and leave it on for 50 minutes, - about the same if I m doing roots, then do the ends for 5 mintues. then rinse) the saran wrap helps with getting a lighter color...I really like this they oughta make a version for great 100 percent grey coverage like excellence products from loreal. im 50 but luckily my family greys later in life. mom didn't get greys til age 60  .  but gotta switch over to excellence when I start getting greys."
5073,0,Hideous_This color is absolutely hideous.  It looks like I have pennies on all of my fingers.  I was expecting this to be a gold glittery polish but I was wrong.  Its a pure copper color and does not look good with pale skin tones.
2913,1,"Luxurious!!!!_This body cream is extremely sensual! It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, smells delicious, and keeps my skin moist in harsh weather. I love it!!!"
5372,1,HELP! I am missing some!!!_I love your products and I am sad to learn the plate #SH 210 hello kitty mushroom was not in the kit I did NOT get any HELLO KITTY stamp plates also... no Mickey mouse either why??? Please help me complete this order !  My daughter is very sad this was not in her order as displayed.
9241,1,Perfect brush!_Extremely s&#8203;oft to the touch but sturdy enough to do its job without any issues. I am thrilled that I found this company. I'll buy more! Highly recommended brush line!!! ++++++++++
8898,1,I love it_oh my glob perfect!
5475,1,A Must Buy!!_This product Is amazing and my hair loves it.I am going to order one in a bigger size and def keep stock of this cream and the smell is wonderful.
7839,1,I love how dramatic they look!_I love really dramatic eyelashes so these were perfect for me. And I have big blue eyes so I don't need to cut them or anything like that. I usually can reuse one pair about 5 times before I throw them out so they hold up really well. My favorite lash glue comes from Revlon and it goes perfectly with these lashes and any lashes really. I've ordered form them before and I've been happy everytime I've ordered from them. And you can't beat the price for how many pairs you get. Love them!
9315,1,"Really Good_Prior to trying this, I was using a similar product that I was buying from my dermatologist that costs about three times as much! I decided to give this a try and I am so glad that I did. It has really made a difference in my under eye area. The skin is much smoother and healthier looking. I am fair skinned and have to use concealer and I have noticed that since I have been using this product my make up stays on much better. I like that fact that it only takes a small amount. That way the product lasts way longer which is great for my wallet. I use it morning and night. I will continue to purchase this because I am one happy customer  :)"
6145,1,"Smells beautiful!_I love the smell of this wash, it was purchased from Target for my little Sister but I ended up trying it out and it leaves your skin smelling gorgeous afterwards. Made me feel like an Egyptian princess or something with the Frankincense & Myrrh scent. Very relaxing too!"
6731,1,"Love it!_Have been on a quest to find a night cream that would not irritate my overly sensitive skin.  I've tried many other creams (Cetaphil, First Aid Beauty, La Mer, etc, but always something in the ingredients bother my skin, i.e. fragrance or other chemicals).  The only night cream that seems to work for me is Elemis Collagen Marine Cream, but it's very expensive per jar and I have to use that sparingly to make it last up to a few months.  Otherwise, discovering Neutrogena Naturals has been a God-send and am glad that it's been working well for my overly sensitive skin.  Have also used the other products (lip balm and moisturizer) with equal satisfaction.I will point out that some others have complained about the &#34;scent&#34; of the cream.  I would have to imagine that this &#34;natural&#34; cream would have an mineral smell due to the natural ingredients, but there is a pleasant, citrus overtone (at least that what it smells like to me) that does well to mask the mineral smell.  This citrus scent is fine for me and I actually like it alot, but I guess not everyone will like it."
4034,1,"They look awesome with mascara_This stuff works very well.  I have to admit I had my doubts but I have used it for about 6 wks. and I finally have eye lashes you can see, with or without mascara.  They look awesome with mascara.  I will be purchasing more of this.  Easy to use, once a day before bed.  If you can put eyeliner on then you can do this, it's that easy."
730,1,GREAT !_It smells SO good. Kind of like starbursts :DThis is a GREAT product ! When I run out I'll definitely be re-purchasing.
2896,1,Excellent quality_This is a GREAT set of brushes! Very high quality from handles to bristles.Each brush comes individually packages in great quality packaging not just wrapped in cellophane.I will be using these for a long time. Comes with every brush you will ever need to do complete make up and the price can't be beat!
6987,0,"Left me with discoloration_This face wash has a fizzy bubbling effect that left my skin with small red marks that took a long time to fade. I think the fizzy factor irritates the skin, at least for me."
4611,1,Great stuff!_This is great for if you want to thicken the look of your hair in certain areas. Definitely recommend this product!!!
614,1,Yes!_My go-to sunscreen.  I have very sensitive skin and this is all I can use.  Doesn't cake up either and is easy to wash off in the shower.  Love!
5282,1,Great!_Great sunblock to use for my family. We took one bottle to the beach and it kept our family sunburn free and enjoying the water.
9704,1,"So far, so good_Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy with &#8220;intense hydration&#8221; is described as a &#8220;deep hydrating treatment mask&#8221; meant to leave hair &#8220;strong and beautiful.&#8221; Well, of course.  Who would purchase a hair care product that promised to make hair weak and hideous?This product is not meant for daily use. It is intended as a weekly substitute for a conditioner. After washing your hair, apply Clear Scalp  and Hair Beauty Therapy to your scalp, let it remain in your hair for three minutes, then rinse. Simple. My hair did seem cleaner and freer from those annoying and sometimes painful tangles after use, but the long-term effect will require long-term use. So far, so good."
4601,1,works!_This Matte Finisher does exactly what it says. It ads a really nice elegant look to my polish and it dries SUPER fast. It's light and not at all thick or goopy. YAY for Essie Matte About You Matte Finisher!!!
941,1,Good brush with a handle_A prior purchase that I used quite a bit.  Another brush was ordered because someone else wanted to use it.
9181,1,Great so far!_I've only used this a couple of weeks but I can definitely see improvements on my stretch marks on my arms. I can't wait to see results in 8 weeks. I think so far it works great. I will update!
7476,1,Mona Lisa_I really love the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy. Shea Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm. I use this product to help seal the moisture in my hair to keek it from gettin dry and breaking. It is doing a wonderful job. I use this product along with other products in the series and the are all just great. If used properly you will get great results. This product is not too heavy and has a very pleasant smell. My hair looks great and smells great after using.
8493,1,Strong hold indeed_This gum is really strong infact unless your hair is rather short or your just apply it to the tips then it may be to much.My husband is in between hair cuts so it made him look like Edward on the first twilight movie lol. My son just got a hair cut and it worked perfectly.My daughter and I used it for a pixie kind of look just for the tips and it was fun for that. An other good product from Axe just really strong.
2634,1,"Best moisturizer for these dry winter months!_This product can be used on your hair, nails, and even your face. As someone who has suffered from breakouts for the last ten years I was pretty wary of rubbing oil on my face, but lo and behold in the week and a half that I have been using this I have not gotten one zit. In fact, I think my skin has taken on a glow that I did not have before. Winter in NY does horrible things to my poor skin, and thought it took a couple of days, my skin is much more hydrated than it ever has been before in the depths of winter. It really doesn't take much product to get full coverage, so this bottle will last a while. I put it on at night after my shower and then I put it on in the morning before I put on foundation. Don't be fooled--this is 100% oily and so the texture is, of course, oily, but it really soaks into the skin very well. Because of this it makes a great base for makeup and I've found that spreading my foundation evenly is easier after using this product. My makeup looks flawless and my skin (by some magic of the gods) doesn't look greasy, and instead I have a nice glow.I give this product 5/5 stars. Awesome."
5399,0,"Disappointed_I bought Cloud 9 for Halloween to wear under a black crackle polish.  It turned out to be much more translucent than I had expected, and thus required 3 coats before the orange really showed up.  It's more of a light orange than a bright pumpkin or traffic cone orange, but it got the job done.  This was my first time using Sinful Colors and overall I was unimpressed.  The polish was thin and runny, and it did not last nearly as long as some of my other polishes."
4124,0,"Pass on this_Sorry I bought it.  I much prefer other brands, this simply didn't make the cut in performance.  I'd avoid buying it."
3641,1,"LOVE THIS!! WORKS SO WELL!!!_I decided to order this after doing some research,  I had taken another hair vitamin for a few months and decided to give something else a try that did not require so many pills per day.  I liked this product because the dosage requirement only required a couple of pills and I was interested in the thicker hair in addition to hair growth.  I have been taking this product for about 6 months now and I LOVE IT!  I have seen so much hair growth - about 8 inches in 6 months, but I LOVE the new thickness in my hair because my hair is generally very fine. I have gotten so many compliments on my hair!!!  I am so pleased!!!"
9734,1,"Overly scented but works well_There might be only a few people left that prefer a bar of soap over body wash when in the shower.  The new Caress Emerald Rush satisfies all the usual requirements for a good soap bar.  The size (4 ounces) and shape is great and it lathers well.  I felt clean after using it... My only complaint is that for me the scent is slightly overpowering. I suppose this is appropriate since it is called a 'fresh beauty bar' with 'lush gardenia and white tea essence.' For my part the tea belongs in tea cups, but overall, at a reasonable price this a is a decent shower soap."
2355,1,"I tried something else and came back to this_When I first got my Clarisonic Pro Skin Care System, I got the cleansers and all 3 brushes that came with it. I thought this cleanser was just fine, but when I was done, I tried my own, very expensive cleanser.Within a few days, I went back and ordered another one of these Gentle Hydro Cleansers.Here are some reasons why:This cleanser easily distributes over your skin. At first I thought it felt too slight and and that it wasn't absorbent enough. But I was wrong - it's the perfect cleanser to use with the system, and thoroughly cleans your face without leaving a soapy feel. When you're done with the Pro System, all you have to do is splash water on your face afterwards and you feel clean and refreshed.It also is very gentle on the skin. At first I thought it was just the Clarisonic Skin Care System that was solely responsible for the my skin looking so good, and for it feeling so silky. But I now realize it's a combination of the two. I have had no break-outs since I've used this cleanser.Lastly, this cleanser lasts a long, long time. You only need a pea-sized drop to spread over your face and neck.  One 6-ounce tube lasts me for *months.*Highly recommended,  for use with the Clarisonic Pro."
8075,1,"The Best_Very very good product,seeing results all the time,nearly time for a new purchase,prompt delivery....Would recommend to friends,Thank you very much."
1284,1,"LOVE_Great color, and exactly what I was looking for! I wanted something for winter that wasn't BLACK, and had a holiday tone to it. This is such a great color."
4014,0,"Tossed_This product came HIGHLY recommended to me by a co-worker, so I know it works wonders for some people, but it left MY hair limp and grungy-looking -- despite the fact I rinsed my hair thoroughly and styled it afterwards with a blow-dryer and flatiron. Obviously my dry/color-treated hair simply isn't dry enough for this product, even though it's TOO dry for many others.Based on my personal experience, I STRONGLY suggest trying a sample of this product before investing in a regular-size bottle."
7438,0,"Conditions okay, smells nice but does not detangle hair well_This conditioner just conditions okay. I expected to be able to run my comb through my hair easily with this product but I could not. To me it did not feel very moisturizing.  One positive is that it does smell very nice but has a subtler scent than theCLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid OunceI use.This is not a conditioner I will be purchasing in the future. The only positive is that I liked it better than the complementaryCLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce."
4658,1,"I like this product ALOT.... it works...does what it's supposed to..._I have been using this for about a month.  I like it.  It works great.  It covers my dark circles.  I rolls on nicely (the metal roller feels cool on my skin, which I like).  Caffeine helps diminish dark circles according to studies. I know there are several products that cost twice as much with only the caffeine benefit and not the cover up benefit, this seems to have both for a better price.  I use this daily and will DEFINETLY buy it again!  I am a happy customer. I am not sure why the other bad reviews?  Obviously NOTHING you can buy is a 'facelift in a bottle'... (although Emu oil really helps with wrinkles....) are people hoping for miracles? Garnier Anti-Dark circle eye roller does exactly what it is advertised to do.  I'm a sasisfied customer."
9564,1,"Gets You Clean!_While this body wash won't necessarily make your irresistible to the object of your affections as the marketing campaign suggests, it does get you clean and smelling good.  The scent is not overpowering and leaves you with a pleasant smell (at least according to my wife) and a feeling of being clean and refreshed."
613,1,"Best Detangler Ever!_*:SUPER .:**:.HAPPY CUSTOMER**:**A+++LOVE IT, EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED GOOD PRODUCT.:**:I bought this item based solely on reviews and I was delightfully surprised. I was looking for an excellent detangler because all others had failed. I had tried chi, pantene, everything at sally's etc. My hair is fine and gets into terrible knots (I don't know how!), but this works wonderfully and never feels greasy or heavy. Love it!"
9554,1,"Smells great and left my skin feeling nice_Although this is a product designed for men, I had to try it before I passed it on to my husband so I could get a good idea of how it performed and write this review. It definitely has a scent that is more male oriented than female, but it's nice and fresh smelling and Axe has a whole line of products with the Peace fragrance that go well together. This gel has a nice texture and when combined with water on my face, produced a nice cleansing foam. It was pleasant to use and did a very good job of cleansing my skin after a long day. My skin felt clean, but not dry afterward. My husband says he likes it and I can see why."
8544,0,"It doesn't work for me._I really wanted this plump spray to work, because I have very fine, naturally wavy hair that I am constantly fighting with to get volume.  But this didn't work for me at all.  Not only did it not add any volume, but it weighed my hair down.  My hair looks crunchy after using this, and it goes flat in a couple hours.I tried using a decent amount of spray, when my hair was wet and then blow-dried it upside down.  I thought perhaps I used too much spray, so the next time I used about half the amount I used the first time.  I got the same results.  Flat, crunchy looking hair.  I don't know why this doesn't work for my hair, as others are raving about it.  It smells good, but it just doesn't work.  It's pretty expensive, but if you think it might work for you, give it a try.  I hope you get better results than I did."
9682,0,"Smells nice, but added no lift, body or volume to my roots_I tried this product a few times, and although it smells nice it didn&#8217;t &#8220;lift&#8221; my hair. I have very fine, limp hair, and I saw no improvement in lift, body or volume after using this Root Lift Spray.  If fact I think my hair was even flatter after using the spray because it seemed to leave a little oily residue on my roots (which tend toward oiliness anyway).  So this is not a product I would use again.  It might work for some hair types, but it didn&#8217;t work on my fine, limp hair."
7485,0,"Too heavy for curly hair_I tried this shampoo along with the conditioner of the same kind and found them to be very heavy for my curly hair. It also made my hair look lifeless, which was pretty strange because my hair did feel very soft to the touch. It is a pearly creamy liquid and smells wonderful, I was hoping to be able to use it since it did make my hair feel soft when washing it, but cant explain why the end result was so bland. Anyway, I have a feeling that it is not for curly hair."
9511,1,Love the smell_This stuff smells so good. My kids love it. They also love that it is all three in one. Makes shower time super simple for them.
4339,1,Great product_I'm happy I got this...first off I realized I've been wearing foundation that is too dark. I like the pump as it doesnt get all over your hands and isn't messy and you don't get more or less than you would want in the pump. Love the product. Thank you!
8412,1,"lasts a while with Simple Human automatic dispenser_Bought this to be used in my Simple Human automatic soap dispenser.  Hasn't caused any clogs yet, smells pleasant and is just the right consistency where it washes off relatively easily while still feeling like you actually cleaned your hands.  This one refill will probably last me the entire year of use due to the enforced small soap usage from the automated dispenser."
9646,1,"Truly Amazing Product!_Ever since I went to Morocco a few years ago, I have been obsessed and addicted to Argan Oil. I use it for everything (my hair, skin, nails). Nowadays, it seems that every product on the market claims to contain Argan Oil and more often than not probably doesn't, so getting a bottle of InstaNatural's 100% Pure Organic Moroccan Argan Oil was heaven sent.Despite it's many benefits (there really is a lot), I like Argan Oil because of its high concentration of vitamin E and essential fatty acids that works great on my dry skin and helps make my hair stay soft.Upon opening the bottle I smelled the slight nutty scent that I expect of true, authentic Argan Oil. There is no way for me to know for sure, but that smell let me know that the bottle definitely contained the real oil. Although I wish I would have gotten the pump bottle, the dropper version still makes it a lot simpler for use with less mess and less waste.If you were ever afraid to try Argan Oil, InstaNatural offers a LIFETIME 100% Satisfaction Money Back Guarantee, so it you're not completely satisfied, you can return the bottle and get a full refund, but I know you won't."
3879,1,Pump up the volume_I love all Big Sexy Hair products and I really like this even for just let my hair air dry to waves.
3651,1,Great for very gentle washing_I wash my face with a spritz bottle full of distilled water. I needed something that wasn't so harsh that it needed to be scrubbed out to avoid horrible things. This does the job and helps my acne as well (I think. Idk. Does it? I use so many new things at once I just can't tell anymore -.-). Has a cooling effect which is nice I guess?? Makes me feel like it isn't getting into my pores which I know isn't true but it's a mental thing okay. Smells fine. Never used anything with tea tree oil but it smells fine idk. Whoop.
7690,1,"great product and amazing price_I didnt want to invest a lot since I am just starting with gel nails,  but this product is great! I have since ordered more."
5620,1,"Can't Find Research that Epsom Salts Get Through Skin_The San Franciso Salt Company makes a variety of fragrant bath salts, and I adore their lavender, which is made with sea salt. I was quite intrigued to see how their 'Epsoak' Bpsom Salt bath salt compared.The first thing I'll note is that while the lavender comes in a pretty, fold-over-top plastic container, the Epsom Salt comes in essence in a clear baggie with a ziplock closure. Not a big deal, but a little less like a &#34;spa experience&#34;. It has no aroma at all - its ingredients are solely epsom salt / magnesium sulfate. If you are sensitive to scents this could be a good thing. If you enjoy fragrance in your bath it means you'll have to add something to this to get the experience you crave.The salts &#34;cake up&#34; fairly quickly even when sealed. They need to be bashed to loosen them.My big question, though, is what is epsom salt vs sea salt. Most of us know about the wonders of sea salt - how people adore sea salt soaks because it helps our skin be soft and healthy. The water feels softer and more relaxing. Is the same true for magnesium sulfate?Intriguingly, in the research I've done, I can't find how having salt on the outside of your skin has any effect at all on your muscles within the skin. Your skin exists to keep objects out of your body. The salt content outside might impact that outer layer of skin to soften it - but it doesn't somehow permeate the skin barrier and then move in a targeted fashion to the muscles. When I do research on baths I do find information, for example, about oatmeal baths helping with poison ivy. I've had poison ivy many times and can vouch for it helping. But I can't find any research that indicates salts in the bath water get into your muscles.Apparently the skin DOES let in some fats - and this is how researchers create things like the nicotine patch which lets chemicals in through your skin in a controlled fashion. But I can't find that salts can pass through. In fact there's apparently a study on this very topic - look on the NIH website for PMID 19216298 - and they found the magnesium sulfate did NOT get through the skin.So in terms of these epsom salts being better or worse than other epsom salts, I'll give it a 4/5. It's nice and simple, no artificial additives, and I'm sure those with fragrance sensitivities will appreciate that. But in the larger question of whether buying ANY epsom salts are worth it - I highly suggest you do some research. Yes, soaking in hot water helps relax muscles which is a good thing. But I'm not finding that adding any salts into the water make a difference. It's not somehow making the bath water &#34;better&#34; at soaking those muscles.I'm open to hearing from people who have found other research, that having magnesium sulfate in your blood system is a good thing!I received a review bag of these salts in order to provide an honest review."
201,1,"Just enough bubbles_When you're a grown up and you take a bubble bath it's more for stress relief than for bubbles. This doesn't foam up too terribly, and dissipates enough after 20 minutes or so (shorter if you splash around more) so you can use the water for an actual bath like you can't always do with a really foamy bubble bath."
3869,0,I love nyx products but.._the reason i gave it a 2 stars is because when i opened the 'unused' product it was very very dry and not all that pigmented. I couldnt even get a useful swatch out of it. but it pairs well with the nyx 'africa'...all in all i think they should moisten it up a bit
1010,1,"Clear skin!_My skin definitely cleared up after using! I was having stubborn break outs along my chin line and forehead that was driving me insane. Once I started using 2x day (morning and at night), I started seeing difference. It also didn't irritate my skin but I always made sure my skin was well moisturized to prevent that potential side effect."
3305,1,Great Product!_I bought this yesterday & used it last night.  My hair looks great!  I love it!
5198,1,I'll never buy Skinceuticals again!_My girlfriend turned me on to this and I love it!! More active ingredients than Skinceuticals CE Ferulic and a fraction of the cost!
5795,1,"Nice smelling with good hair hold_Axe Styling Aid Spiking Glue is a nice product.  It smells good, not overpowering, and holds the hair in place.  Just remember to only use a finger tip amount or it gets to be a sticky mess.  I have used other products that are too waxy and stiff.  Axe Styling Glue is lighter and leaves a softer feel to the hair.  Well worth getting for hair grooming."
3665,1,"By far the best!_These are the best drugstore lipsticks. They're creamy and go on easily and there's s ton of colors to choose from for any mood or look. They're NOT matte! If you want matte, try the 14 Hour lipsticks. These have a bit of glossiness but are not goopy or sticky and never leave my lips feeling dry. I already own a bunch of different shades and still haven't gotten all of my favorites yet!"
1743,1,"Swisa Beauty, Dead Sea Facial Peel, 1.01-Ounce_It gently lifted all aging problems and impuritties on my skin, make skin look younger. I will keep trying it. thank you."
2655,1,Prenier dead sea agless cell Renewal serum_Great product!  Goes on smooth and feels so good on.  I use it on my neck and face everynight before bed.
9385,1,Love the antioxidants_I have always been into health and always look for products that are high in antioxidants.I was quite surprised to find them in a skin care product. I must say that I am impressed with this serum.My skin feels great!
5029,1,"Really like this..._The brush is soft, so it's not like your scrubbing your face raw...but you will need to exfoliate every few days with something a bit rougher.  I only gave it 4 stars because it's extremely difficult (at least it was for me) to open the battery compartment.  The directions say to rock back and forth...not a lot of wiggle room -- nothing moved.  I finally used a butter knife to separate the compartment from the base.  After getting a start, i was able to open it.  Not a big deal -- I don't anticipate changing the batteries that often.I would recommend this -- it makes your skin feel very soft.  I also have a Neutrogena Facial Cleanser that has velcro fastening pads (disposable).  Similar concept and useful for a deeper scrub as the pads are rougher and more exfoliating. Downside of that is, pads need to be replaced after each use - so you can go through a lot.  i'll be using that one every so often, but the Olay product will be used twice daily!"
3070,1,"Ok but_Ok I bought those on the back of reviews raving about it.  The only thing I don't like about these is they snag my hair when I am gliding/sliding it through my sections.  And I hate that cos it hurts.  I had GHD's before this and swore by them but them broke, so this was my replacement.  I don't know why they snag but I wish they didn't.  Other than that  they are a good paid of straighteners."
4340,1,"Very satisfied_I like no transfer lipsticks, and I like the plum shade provided by this line, it matches my NC35 comaplexion perfectly ..staying power is quite good ."
5444,0,"The name 'Genie' implies magic, which this brush CERTAINLY does not have_With extraordinarily damaged hair that is straight on top, but quite wavy on the bottom (and thus knots VERY easily), I am always on the lookout for a good brush that will detangle my hair without further damaging it.  I have therefore accumulated a large tote bag full of brushes and combs.When I purchased the Knot Genie, I had such high hopes that it would work well and would eliminate my need to purchase more and more brushes and combs.  Unfortunately, my desire for the 'perfect' brush was not fulfilled by the Knot Genie.Instead of detangling my hair, the Knot Genie ripped out chunks of hair.  Chunks.  Gone.  Its plastic 'teeth' also don't hold up to much, so several 'teeth' bent within weeks of acquiring this brush.  That made the ripping issue even worse.This Knot Genie made it no easier to detangle my hair than did a paddle brush or theThe Wet Brush Detangling Shower Brush (Colors Vary).  It is not worth spending more than about $5 on this brush."
2859,1,"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!_Great color, it really is periwinkle.  Depending on what you wear with it, it will appear either bluish or purple-ish.  Love it, it's real fun on both fingers and toes!!China Glaze is my favorite nail polish, and a favorite of most of my friends too.  I've heard some complain on here (Amazon) about how it's too thin, requires several coats, color is not true, yada yada yada.I dispute all of that.  China Glaze is NOT your average nail polish.  Apply ONE (1) VERY THICK COAT.  One thick coat that you would never do with another polish... real thick, so that you have full coverage and there's no nail showing through.  Let dry... it dries really fast compared to other polishes.  You're done!  No second coat ever needed, and I have about 20 different colors... it's been the same with every one!  I have never found a color that required more than one THICK coat.It glides on beautifully, dries quickly... but my favorite thing about it is the relatively low odor.  The 'nail polish smell' dissipates pretty quickly.  An hour or two after I paint my nails, I can no longer smell it.Sure, a dark color like this is going to show chips... touch ups are easy and look great.  I often get a week or more from my manicure, just by touching up.  Light colors, I get even more time from.I can't say enough great things about China Glaze.  It's the best polish on the market, in my humble opinion!"
4944,1,"Wow, so many Qtips_My wife and I will have these for years. So many to use. They are great for after the shower."
9014,1,"Lurv_It's so small and cute. I thought it would take up a lot of space, but was pleasantly surprised. Great to display my high end lipsticks"
9321,1,"gentle and effective_I got this in an e.l.f. Beauty Bundle and at first, I thought, what would I ever use this for?  But it was winter at the time, and I had been playing around with different lip colors lately, and some of them are not very moisturizing.  Pretty soon my lips got chapped.  And then I remembered that I had this lip exfoliator.Overall, I like this fairly well, but I find it to be a bit inconsistent at times.  Sometimes it feels more moisturizing to me, and sometimes it feels scratchier.  (There are little rough bits that do the exfoliating.  The rough bits don't seem to transfer to the lips at all, and they do gently get rid of dead skin cells.)I like that this contains a lot of plant oils, although please note that ceresin is derived from mineral wax.  Also please note that it contains aspartame, which I find a little odd since it also has sugar in it.  (I don't have anything against aspartame; I consume it all the time.  I'm just passing on the information in case it is a concern for you.)This does not add any color or shine to the lips and is probably not a substitute for a lip balm.  However, the oils and waxes do soften the lips somewhat.  I think it would be best for people who want to even out the skin on the lips, for example, prior to applying lip stains (which look best with smooth lips), or for people with highly chapped lips."
8743,1,"L'Oreal Telescopic Shocking Extensions Mascara &lt;3_Wow. Just seriously, wow. This mascara is the MOTHER of mascaras!!!! I have short, straight eyelashes, but I do have the volume most people want. First I curl my lashes with a Relvon eyelash curler, then I apply this from root to tip. NO clumps, NO flaking, and NO eye irritation! This makes my lashes looong and BEAUTIFUL. This is the mascara I was meant to be with... &lt;3"
5429,1,"Coolest thing!_This does take a little practice (like a few hours of my frustration) before it starts looking really, really cool-Keep in mind, though, that I'm a perfectionist, so it may take you much less time to be satisfied. This tool is awesome!"
1725,0,"Mixed feelings about this one_I received this mascara in brown, and I have mixed feelings.  On the one hand, it didn't flake one bit, which is wonderful.  I have a allergies and tend to rub my eyes, and it stayed on beautifully.  On the other hand, it didn't do what I expect a mascara to do.  It didn't thicken my lashes at all.  It lengthened them a little bit, but they still look very thin.  If you're looking for a natural look, or maybe you're a blonde who just wants some color to make your blonde lashes show up better, this would be okay.Footnote: After another full day of wearing this mascara, I'd like to up my rating to 3 stars, but the site's not letting me.  I'll just put it into words.  This mascara's staying power makes up for its lack of thickening.  It simply does not flake!  Maybe it's just fresher than other mascaras I've used, but it I don't think that's it.  No brand new mascara I've ever worn is this flake-resistant."
6668,1,"It does what it says it will_I brought this product and me and my daughter both tried it. I have curly hair and she has relaxed. The smell is really good and sweet ( it smells like bananas- not coconut - I hate coconut so that was a plus). Our results were that, it made my hair well moisturized but turned my curls into a baby fro, my daughter on the other hand loves it. So, I would say it's a great product in general, especially for anyone with permed hair, or if you use alot of heat when styling."
592,1,Works as advertised._Good stuff from PM. Our little girl tangles my wifes hair and she swears by this stuff. She really likes it.
4274,0,Too harsh_I have used other brands of microdermabrasion products and thought I would try this one.  I am truly disappointed.This came in an almost solid form and was stiff to use.  It didn't lather up well and was harder to remove with water.  The directions also stated that it should be used every other day and then skip a week.  This tells me it is way too harsh for me.
1735,1,"Refreshing Invigorating Moisture_This is so moisturizing and refreshing it feels like you've just splashed water on your face..but better. It has a nice light texture and light invigorating scent. It feels like your skin just drinks it up. I'm totally addicted to this. For the price (so cheap) and the huge tub, I use it everywhere even though it says it's a facial moisturizer. I'm not sure if it's making me more youthful...but this is a great lotion and I would recommend."
5228,1,Five Stars_Keeps out the light and comfy! Decided to purchase the zebra one too! :)
3779,0,"Okay_I had used a sample and really liked it a while back. I don't know what the difference was, but I did not like how my hair would feel the next day after I washed it. It just felt kind of grimy and dirty. It did not feel stronger, shinier, softer, or more moisturized. I like a lot of the products in this line, but I won't be buying this one again.For reference, I have fine, thin hair that is color treated. A lot of hair products do not work with my hair; i.e., making it feel dirty and weighed down. It is entirely possible that someone with a different hair type would get better results with this."
1316,1,"Really Works!!_I Get this for my husband. He works outside in the sun and gets sun spots on his cheeks. This product really makes a difference. Does it remove them all- no, but most and he likes how it moisturizes because he also has really dry skin. I've even bought him the Clinique new brown spot corrector he didn't like it as much. so get this and the Reviva lightning day face cream which he uses together with this."
1335,1,"A Must For Fast Drying Nails_While I use Seche Top Coat Rapid Dry, I also spritz a dash of the OPI Rapidry Top Coat, which helps set my nails in minutes. Within an hour, my nail polish is completely dry and ready to conquer the world."
5931,1,"great_These lashes are made very well.  I have never worn false lashes in the past, but I made the mistake of going to a salon and letting them glue in some fake lashes.  When they fell out a month later, some of my lashes fell out with them.  I won't make that mistake again.  These lashes served their purpose until my lashes grew back out."
398,1,"My favorite hair color_I love this hair color, have use it for many years. I am more then 50% gray and after 20-30 min it covers it all up.  It leaves your hair smelling good and really shiny and doesn't dry out your hair like other hair colors."
8914,1,"Worked Surprisingly Well!_Treated a raised blackhead that other peels I bought would not touch. Turned it brown and ugly, but it shriveled up and fell off in about a week. Strong stuff! It is now gone permanently. There is a little pink spot left, which is fading away. I am very satisfied."
39,0,"skin itchy and dry *after* use_Not an effective moisturizer (for me, anyway). It feels and smells perfectly nice. After use, my skin feels even drier and itchier than it did before I used it; it also seems to create a barrier on my skin: lotion applied after the oil (later in the day, for example) doesn't help at all. Looks like I'll be getting rid of this and going back to a shea butter-heavy lotion."
2426,1,"Very Satisfied_Very happy with this purchase, this is also for my hair care.Love the moisture. This produt does exactly what it says it does.Well worth it and the money."
2279,1,Love the smell and texture_I started using conditioners in place of shampoos and have noticed very little after hair is dried in terms of moisture. I still like the smell and texture and price.
9799,1,"I'm LOVING this Vitamin C!!!_This Vitamin C has a thicker feeling than other vitamin C serums I've tried. InstaNatural also has a very pleasant faint scent that disappears within minutes of application. This serum glides on my skin and absorbed quickly. This Vitamin C doesn't feel greasy. My face also doesn't feel tight and dry after I apply the Vitamin C. I use it morning and night. I love it under my makeup because Vitamin C also is a great sunscreen! Look at me being all smart and responsible with my skin!!  I've been using the Vitamin C serum on my face, neck and the back of one hand!! Just so I can show you the difference after just 2 weeks of use!! Not only is InstaNatural helping my complexion, but the Vitamin C serum can help reduce inflammation! Even scars!!  Check my full review at [...] I was supplied a bottle of InstaNatural Vitamin C for the purpose of this review. All opinions are 100% my own."
9478,1,"A wide detangler_This is a brush that gets the tangles out easier than regular hair brushes but is not fool proof. My hair is thicker than most, but as I have aged it has lost some of that depth that it had, so it is nice to have a brush that might help lessen any hair loss by pulling out hair that is snarled.The brush itself is wider than any I have ever used. It is harder to get hairs out after you brush. With most brushes, I just run a comb through to pull any hair out. With this you have to pull out any hairs individually. This is because of the round plastic ends that have little balls on them - you cannot run a comb through it.It feels good and just as soft as my natural bristle brushes.  It does seem to do a better job detangling the fine hairs at the nape of my neck.There are some cautions with it: prolonged high heat that some dryers put out can ruin the bristles.You cannot use it in the shower, bath or soak the handle. Normally I clean brushes with baking soda in water to remove any built up oil but there are no hints or directions on how to clean this brush.Still it seems to work better as a hairbrush for my longer hair."
7915,1,"I love the colors!!!_I got my purchase today, sooner than expected.  The stones are perfect size for nail decoration and they come in a very sturdy box that keeps them secure.  Recommend 100%."
9024,1,"Derma Roller_I got this about a week ago, I am looking forward to seeing results which may take several weeks.. I am going to buy a intensive moisturizer to assist and maybe an anti-wrinkle cream.  The one catch is that it is VERY painful.  I wasn't expecting it to hurt so much.  Then again it is tiny little needles so I should have expected nothing less.  I like it a lot though.. I can see a little difference after a week."
5526,1,"Great Prepping Primer!_Like all others that review this product, the feel is greasy at first but then blends in perfectly to the skin to leave a great satin surface for apply make-up, eyeshadow, etc. I bought my first tube at a Nordstrom's sale and it lasted about a year! This one was my second purchase."
6397,1,Perfect eyeliner brush_I LOVE THIS brush! Perfect for my eyeliner and lets me get into the lash line absolutely perfectly! First time using Sigma and to be honest I think this is as good as any of my Mac brushes and way less money!
5900,1,"Nice_Very nice mascara, I use it when I want some thick lashes :D the price is also just right Give it a try"
1392,1,"great case_this case is well built, sturdy and strong material. I would reccomend this case to every woman. Great price for a great case."
8758,1,"Great product!_I completely recommend this shampoo, along with the conditioner, it has kept my color and highlighted hair shiny and fade resistant. (been using for about a month now)"
6147,1,"Me encanta_Muy buen producto lo recomiendo ampliamente, va muy bien con mi tipo de piel y con lo que necesito, feliz con mi compra, lo volvere a comprar cuando lo necesite, gracias."
9401,1,"not just for hair_I love argan oil and this one is very nice. It has a nice fragrance and absorbs very well.  My hair is fine and tends to be oily and I find that since I have been treating my hair (about 6 months)  regularly that my scalp doesnt seem to get as oily, if that makes any sense and my hair is shiny and healthy looking.  And i really love it on my skin and fingernails.  It makes a big difference in my line and wrinkles, relaxing and smoothing.  My cuticles used to be a mess and are vastly improved since I have been using argan oil on them. I like the pump bottle.  Good customer service with a money back guarantee...fast shipping"
8687,1,"It works well!_Used twice now and found the eye make-up removed completely and I had no skin irritation.  The scent is barely noticeable and pleasant.  It's not the only eye make-up removal product that works for me, but it does as well as any and better than several others I have tried.Recommended purchase."
4330,1,"Gotta have it!_Ok, so I'll be honest. The first time I smelled this I thought it was too much. Meaning, I felt a lil overwhelmed by the initial try on BUT it did wear off on me and now I absolutely love it. This is the perfume I wear for when I'm going out on the scene or wearing something real fly. It's that kind of scent to me. I like the lotion also that goes with it. It doesn't make my hands itch or anything. The perfume has good endurance to it as well. It doesn't last like some others I have tried but it gets the job done so I definitely recommend Beyonce's Heat. I think its her best one thus far and its truly something for us youngins, lol!"
490,1,Borrowed & Blue_I did not purchase Borrowed & Blue for a wedding but more of a calm fall color. It looks great after two coats. I usually wear Cult -wicked fast top coat or CND super shiney and it looks great.
2482,1,"A Very Pretty Blue_For Audrey is a very pretty blue color.  I am giving it 4 stars because I am not really a fan of blue nails.  Everyone compares it to Tiffany & Co.  I've never owned anything from Tiffany & Co., so this is as close as I'll get.  If you love blue nail polish, you can't go wrong with For Audrey."
8162,1,"As good as the expensive brand_These worked pretty good, although it is a little time consuming if you have a lot of long hair like I do.  Takes practice.  But these work fine."
6761,1,"Thin but good price_The price is excellent for the amount of tape and variety of colors that you get. However, the tape is a bit on the thin side and can be hard to find the ending of the tape sometimes."
2406,1,Excellent_Very simple to use. I ordered 2 more after using the first one. Everyone I know asks how I did my daughters hair. Super simple and cute.
9180,1,Great_Who doesn't have stretch marks? I have tried everything to try to get rid of them and finally i found a product that makes them less visible. I am happy with this product.
2825,1,"Just like my favorite Sugar scents but with cooler packaging_I love this scent. I have every cotton candy pink sugar scent and was so excited to see the Goddess of beauty still rolling out products! Gale Hayman is one of the original beauty queens of Beverly Hills so I knew it was going to be good. I have never seen this item anywhere. It smells fantastic and the bottle looks tres chic on my perfume stand. If you like pink sugar, you will love this"
9664,1,"So far, So good!_I was a little skeptical of such a hot pink brush but I have to say this brush gives great coverage for powder! It's very soft but easy to use/apply. I also like the shorter handle. It gives me better grip/control. And so far, no bristles have come out. The only problem I had was the initial smell coming out of the bag. After a day of airing, it seemed to dissipate."
8524,0,Dont buy it_When I bought my Staighener I figured I would buy a new bottle of heat protectant. Bad idea. When I got this in the mail it had almost completely soaked through the package it spilled out so much. Very poor. Do not buy this.
3916,0,"Not good_A lip gloss that is too dry to appear, worst then kids gloss the color does not show up don't buy"
7906,1,The best shampoo_When I 1st went natural I had a hard time finding staple products. But this shampoo is the best and it's a great detangler for both relaxed and natural hair. The only bad thing about this is the smell. It smells like loud medicine. But it does clean the hair and the plus is that it lathers up like a regular shampoo. Besides the smell I would compare it to shea moisture coconut and hibiscus curl and shine shampoo.
7869,1,"Great matte palette_I purchased this palette about a year ago. I find myself using it for subtle daytime looks most often. There are some beautiful shadows that work really well for my coloring, which is pinky fair. There are also some lovely shadows that don't work as well on me (but would probably work well for someone with olive tones or darker coloring) so there are a few really well loved shadows, and some are basically untouched.I don't use the bottom row much at all, although the blushes are both quite nice, and I do use the black shadow on the bottom row.  But in general, I find the packaging slightly bulky since I don't use that bottom row.Also, I worry about breakage when traveling, as the packaging is hard plastic.  I have traveled with it a few times, and I had no problems, but I don't find myself traveling with it often.Overall, I think this is a great palette for the money. The matte shades can be used to create a nice look on their own, or they can be used to blend out deeper colors from other palettes or single shadows."
8313,1,"Make Yourself a Smoothie_For reference, I have thick and highlighted fine hair that can get real pouffy and frizzy with the humidity.  Yeah, it expands!  Used Suave's Deep Conditioning Shine Mask along with their corresponding Moroccan hair oil.  This mask has a pleasant fragrance, and it's not overwhelming.  The product is not thick as I had envisioned but instead is rather soupy.  That said, this mask worked just like a good conditioner.  However, masks or anything proclaiming 'deep conditioning' infer a higher level of results.  And they cost more for less product.  Did not see mask-like results.  I know my deep conditioners because the best will yield fairly dramatic results.Moroccan oil or argan oil are buzz words in the hair industry right now.  This mask is a combination of cones, coconut oil and argan oil.  Less desirable ingredients include mineral oil and petroleum.  Label readers in the know realize that the further down the list an ingredient appears, the less of that substance is actually in the product.  On this label, argan oil appears toward the very bottom.My hair looked fairly smooth but not particularly shinier than usual.  Thought this was going to have more impact, but on the hand, results might be more dramatic for those with substantially damaged hair (mine isn't)."
2140,1,"It works_Seems to be working. It is creamy, easy to apply and helps with the redness . A good moisturizer."
9778,1,"Manly Yes, but I like it Too!_Ok, I know I did not make up that expression. It's from the old Irish Spring commercials from the 70's. But, its true! the scent is made more for men, but I really like it. The scent is very refreshing and makes you feel really clean. It has a nice lather to make you feel really clean. However if you have dry skin, you will probably need to go for a more moisturizing product like Dove or Caress, because although it says its hydrating, if your skin is on the dry side, this wash will make it more dry, you need lotion after your shower for sure.  But for normal skin, this is a nice, fresh and clean body wash. The scent is pretty strong so if you are sensitive to scented products, this may not be for you. But if you like the scent of Irish Spring, go for it. I like it a lot."
8883,1,"Love it!_OPI is my favorite, first time ive tried it i have a very had hard time with gel staying on my nails for more than 3 days without lifting up So far i havent had issues iwth OPI its my favorite. And i do use OPI Bondaid though"
8189,1,"Good variety - small canes_This is my third set of canes (will never use all of them, I know).  Although this set had the most variety (200 canes, only three duplicates), the size of the canes were a little too small for my taste. The colors were good, but not quite as vibrant as the MASH canes (the 'true' MASH canes).  These canes did have Hello Kitty and all the Angry Birds in the set and many designs that I did not get in the previous two sets. If you're looking for a good variety, then this set will satisfy your needs."
8375,1,Dense hunter green glitter_This polish seems to be extremely dense hunter green glitter in a clear base.  Covered well in three coats and went on smoothly.  I used it as an accent nail for Christmas and it looked great.
6081,1,like it allot_Smells great & its a bronzer which shows great Color after tanning. I've recommended to a coworker & she enjoyed it too
5645,1,"I love this product_This combined with the exfoliating powder and a face brush do wonders for the skin. I follow it up with bareMinerals moisturizer. I break out with almost all skin care products, but these work beautifully for me. Don't change or discontinue them!!"
2097,1,"Fekkai Technician Color Care Conditioner, 16 oz_I had tried many different conditioners that claimed help for colored hair and was disappointed.  This seems to work as I have used it for almost a year.  I get my hair professionally colored every 8 weeks and the color does not seem to fade"
5479,1,loving these colors!!!!!!!!_i love them i just started using these colors and they are amazing and they dry really fast i would recommend them to any body..
8728,1,"I love This L'Oreal product!_I've tried some other leave-in conditioners, but this one I adore--coupled with the L'Oreal [non-shampoo]cleansing conditioner, my hair has never been better--the two products together have stopped all the terrible dryness, especially on the ends of my hair, that generally caused me to continually need to trim it all off--I've been trying to grow my hair down passed my shoulders for the longest time now, but no matter how many different conditioners I tried, the dryness continued--I was feeling like giving up until I decided to try this product, and the other L'Oreal product that is shampoo-free--the results have been nothing short of wonderful--my hair finally feels like hair again, and not like straw!--I hope and pray I can always purchase those two L'Oreal products down through the years, so that I can keep my hair looking and feeling as beautiful, and soft and manageable as it has become since I began using them!"
7453,1,"Gets better with continued use_The idea behind this hair care line is that to truly nourish your hair, it's important to start at the scalp where the hair grows from as opposed to the length of the hair which is considered to be dead. This makes sense, but I did have some reservations because the directions instruct you to gently massage this conditioner on your scalp and hair stylists have always advised against that because it causes your hair to be weighed down. I went ahead and used the conditioner as directed. After I dried my hair, I was pleased to see that there was more volume at the crown of my head. The downside however, was that my hair did not feel as conditioned as it normally does, but after continued use (about a week or so) it did start to feel softer and conditioned. I do recommend this product, but my advice is to be patient and give it a chance to start working, it's worth it."
1844,1,Great Mascara_I have used this mascara for the last 6 months and just bought this so I wouldn't run out. It goes on very good and stays all day. It is a very good mascara and I wouldn't buy any other. Have had excellent  results with Maybelline products.
5996,1,love style 2_liked these especially the thinner ones for day they were also easy for me to apply. I will definitely order more of the thinner ones .
2317,1,"The perfect shower gel accessory_The Axe Detailer Shower Tool is a must-have accessory for your shower. Simply apply your favorite shower gel to the 'soft' side of the Detailer and you can quickly work up the lather you need to get full coverage. For more difficult situations, for example if you've been in the shop and need to clean off oily or greasy residue, you can use the 'hard' side of the Detailer for scrubbing. The benefit is not only a great clean; but by making a small amount of soap go a long way, you can save a lot of money, too.The bottom line is that the Axe Detailer Shower Tool is the perfect shower gel accessory. Once you start using it, you will never want to go back to the bar soap-and-wash cloth routine. I highly recommend it to everyone!"
5459,1,"Best Dryer!!_For the price, you can't beat this dryer. Almost purchased a T3 but decided against it due to cost. Was not expecting miracles with this one, but it has delivered. I have very damaged highlighted hair, and with the first use this dryer tamed all frizziness and made my hair soft and sleek. Took much less time to dry than my previous Babyliss. I had several coworkers comment on my hair the next day. Love it!! The purple and chrome are super cute too."
5881,1,Blink...yes those are YOUR lashes!_I didn't think I would ever love any mascara more thanMaybelline Great Lash - Big Mascara. However once I applied this mascara I was totally impressed. It seems to lengthen my lashes substantially and gives them great volume. This is however not a waterproof mascara so if you are prone to crying or running about in the rain it might not be the best choice. But for me I like that it removes easily. This mascara will make you feel especially pretty. Yes put this on and blink! Those are YOUR lashes. Believe it or not. I think you will notice the improvement.~The Rebecca Review
8761,1,Glitz n Pieces_This is a neat polish to add to others but not so good on it's own. It also gets really Clumpy! so I don't use it a lot.
9470,0,"A new meaning to 'helmet head'_This is spray laquer.  If that's what you're looking for, then great!  But I was looking for sheer hold hair spray like the name implied.  No so!"
3040,1,"Elf powder_I'm so glad I found this. Its great coverage for a powder with a nice finish and keeps my shiny skin looking matte and nice all day. I do not break out using this product and I have before using a few other products. It would only be a bit better if it had a mirror in it. Instead, I saved an old compact to use for the mirror. I would buy this again."
6823,1,"Fun Project_This is an inexpensive and fun thing to try. Be sure to get enough polish on the image - really dab it in - and then just scrape lightly. Roll the stamper on hard and then roll on the nail. If you don't cover the whole nail the first time, just repeat. It will still look really good."
5203,1,"Great replacement for a more expensive tool_I bought this to replace my T3 curling wand which broke within months of purchase (along with the one I got to replace it, but that's another story). After spending $150 on a product which only lasted for a short time, I was pretty annoyed and didn't want to shell out the same amount to have that happen again.I did a lot of research on different brands, and decided this hot tools wand looked pretty comparable. If it broke on me, I figured it wouldn't be as much of a loss, and I wanted to give the brand a try. Honestly this iron is JUST as good as the one I was replacing (which cost over 4x more). It heats up quickly, and the curls hold until the next day for me. If you are looking for a good quality, tapered curling wand I would not hesitate to recommend this one."
7718,1,Wonderful and Heavenly!_I bought the light color and this B+B cream is wonderful. It feels heavenly to put on and wear. What they are doing with these new type of creams is nothing short of amazing.I highly recommend. The person who complained of itchy skin must have an allergy to something in the product not necessarily the alcohol. I have sensitive skin so we'll see how I do with it.
3618,1,Good product_The only thing I don't like about this is the smell.  It's not terrible but it smells like cucumber.  Solid moisturizer.
4477,1,Love!_i have been using this for years and I haven't found a better serum!  My mom uses Peratin and I like the smell of Her Styler better and the way it makes my hair feel smooth and shinny!
3062,1,Cute little designs_I really like these designs on this plate especially the hearts and the stars because they are a perfect combination! It is a good price as well. Received it earlier than expected!
3544,1,Works!_This is a calming cream.  I always keep some on hand as it really works.  It smells good and is very creamy. The product was well packaged and arrived on time.
3199,1,"LOVE THIS PRODUCT_I love this tea tree oil. I am using it on my skin and have noticed the difference.It is also good for smelly feet..If you can overlook the strong smell, this product is wonderful."
2452,1,"feels silky_This skin cream is awesome. It smells so good as well as refreshing. The best part is that all you need is a little bit, because it will go along way. I like the natural products and its great to fit in your purse"
137,1,"Best facial cream_I have tried facial creams priced from 200 dollars to 4.99!  Aveeno is the very best without question.  It hydrates, smooths, lightens dark areas, and is never greasy.  Just try it once ~  you wont regret it!NOTE:  I recently discovered I have a wheat intolerance.  SOME, not all, Aveeno product use wheat and oats.  Even on my skin, I had problems with reactions.  If you do not have wheat issue...  The Aveeno line is excellent in both results and social responsibility."
450,1,"GREAT CLEANSER_PLEASANT SMELLING AND EASY ON THE FACE, THIS CLEANSER DOES IT ALL AT A GREAT PRICE! I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR ANY AGE. LEAVES FACE FEELING SMOOTH  AND CLEAN. FOLLOW WITH YOUR FAVORITE MOISTURIZER."
7384,1,"Works Well for My Thin Hair_I have long thin, fine, slippery hair that is a challenge because clips and such are forever slipping out.  I don't like to use smaller clips because the minuscule size that I need tends to emphasize the lack of volume and make my hair look bad.This ingenious solution of simply putting a little grippy, rubber-like pad inside the clip allows me to use something a little bigger to give my hair the appearance of more volume.  I used it yesterday for the first time and was pleased that at the end of the day it hadn't budged.  My hair looked nice all day long!"
4443,1,"Good stuff_This moisturizer is great. I had been using Purpose moisturizer but while it is non-comedogenic, it takes a while for the lotion to sink into the skin. This moisturizer has a nice texture and is easily absorbed but also makes your skin feel moisturized. It is unscented, and you only need a pea sized dab for your face and neck. The only downside is that there is no sunscreen in the moisturizer, so make sure you buy some. I use Neutrogena face sunscreen."
3114,1,"Great Multi Use Product_Argan oil is one of those great products that you can use for anything from cooking to using as a facial moisturizer.My hair is on the dry side. It is also fine. I have been using this for about 2 months now and I like it very much. Used minimally this goes a long way. I normally apply a small amount (less than a dime) and work it through my freshly washed wet hair paying special attention to the ends and then I style it with a blow dryer on a low setting. The end result is shiney and smooth hair that seems to have a good moisture balance.This has a slightly fruity scent that is pleasant and not overpowering.I normally use Josie Maran Argan Oil on my face and neck, but forgot it so I used this on my face and arms as well and was surprised that this actually did a good job and was comparable to the Maran product. For what it's worth, I think argan oil must be the equivalent to liquid gold. It is as marvelous moisturizer, but works well on the hair as well."
6385,1,Great Brush!_This brand is really well made I love MAC and will start purchasing these brushes. They work just as good as MAC and cheaper.
3516,0,"Runny, gritty, and leaves greasy ghostly white film_This product has VERY HIGH zinc oxide content-close to 25%, but, BOY! is it white, runny, gritty, and oily! First, the oil and the white lotion came out separately, one has to shake the container to mix them, then the runny opaque white lotion does not vanish or dry completely, and stains everything on contact, hours after application. My neck and arms look ghostly white, as if covered w/ a thin calamine lotion, and still show white streaks at the end of day. The grittiness is unpleasant and similar to that of natural peanut butter.When lotion is applied, there is a warm sensation on skin which feels as if it cannot breathe. The smell is similar to that of stale natural almond butter.TUBE DESIGN FLAW: In time, to close tube, you need to use both hands, look very closely to make sure that the little plastic knob at the center of CAP fit into the tiny hole at center of tube! Frustrating!How do some reviewers get to state that it is too thick? Was I mailed a decade old tube? I don't recommend it. TruKid Sunny Days still ranks top on my list."
5260,0,No likey_Tried it for about a week.  I have no idea if it would have worked cuz I stopped taking it.  Made me nauseus and I felt like it was stuck in my esophagus.
1311,1,Moisturizer for older skin types_Its a rich and creamy moisturizer which leaves my face and neck feeling very soft and nice. It does help with making my skin more taught as well. Great product!
3645,1,"Never go back._ONe more thing I have a problem with is holding a big honking dryer and trying to do something with the other hand with a brush.  This is pretty light.  It dries very quickly.  The controls are not tricky to operate.  If I can get a decent result, anyone on earth can.  Try it and you will never go back."
2615,0,"Very difficult to hold_I was excited about this product as I straighten my hair, and any way to make it easier is of interest.I found using this product very difficult. You had to hold it and pull the hair through, and I did not find that this significantly straightened my hair at all.I finally took all the accessories off and used it as a regular hair dryer, in which case it worked fine."
9688,1,"Better than other Dove products_This works better on my daughter's medium weight hair than my own very fine, but for both it was much better than other Dove products I've used. No obnoxious odor, rinsed out fairly well, good texture afterward. I'd buy this."
8918,1,Mud mask of wonder_after trying the BEST Sage dandruff shampoo bgy Maple Holistic..decided to give this product a go..i LOVE IT..it takes some getting used to..recommend wetting face before applying  mud..makes your skin feel like new..highly recommend..the purity of the products they make is not seen often
841,1,Awsome._My husband has forgotten he has other fragrances.He asked me for it when we first met and he got it this year for Christmas.
4677,1,"The Usual_Been using this product for years. Not a cure for acne, but good for treatment and clearing skin. NOTHING can cure acne. People need to realize that."
5052,1,"Nice lipstick_It goes on smoothly and last quite a long time, color was just ok. I expected more of a pink shade."
1973,1,"great caly much better than misk_Is great ,look at all the good review ,Is cheaper and works ,a little can works well.good for all of age .You don't have to go Indian ,You can get this  staff done by Amazone"
393,1,"TRUELY AMAZING, AND FULL OF GRACE!!_I simply love this whole fragrance line. It's one of my favorites. I 'layer with this ' starting with the shower gel, then the body lotion, then the perfume. I get many, many compliments on it. It has a clean, just showered fragrance that lasts all day!!"
4802,1,"Creates Gorgeous Curls!_This curling iron allowed me to create some gorgeous curls in my daughter's long hair that look better than curls I've tried making in her hair with other more conventional curling irons.  I'm thinking that's due to the tapered barrel. I've never owned a tapered barrel curling iron before.The curling iron heats up quickly, which is a plus.  I also like the digital display.It is a little tricky to maneuver, but I was able to quickly get the hang of it.  I think it would be more awkward to use on myself if I had long hair, but my hair is too short to be able to tell.  I did try it on my hair, but my hair is just too short (in between bob & shoulder length).  Finally, I wondered what would happen if I lost the glove.  I certainly couldn't use the curling iron without it.  I don't know where I would be able to find a replacement.  I wish there was a way to operate the curling iron without having to have the glove."
4670,1,"WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW and WOW!!!!_NEWS FLASH (This is based on the new non publicized formula change where isopropyl alcohol has been removed and replaced with a neutral one... benzene (sp) alcohol, low on the ingredients list.  Also the oils have moved up the ingredients list!!!)Ok so I have a story with this one.  I am so pleased with the results. I am African American and have naturally curly 3c hair. This legitimately so awesome!  My hair was soft AND hydrated, NO silicone in this product.  Now for those with natural hair, I did a wash and go with this as my rinse out conditioner.  I could tell a BIG difference.  My hair was defined and SOOOO soft. I use Paul Mitchell The Conditioner as my leave in with Eco Styler w/ argon.  This is the best conditioner and I have gotten the best results.  I couldn't keep my hands out of my hair.I was a bit of a product snob and would only use professional products.  I would stock up once a year in July when Beauty Brand had their liter sale... all Professional liters for $11.99 (went up a dollar this year). Well, in May I found out that Redken was discontinuing their Smooth Down line.  I was floored!  Joico Moisture Recovery is a great second but I don't care for the smell. So I went on a hunt. A friend that has been natural for 6 years told me about this one.  I reluctantly bought it and found it to be better than the Redken and the Joico.  I also love As I Am Coconut cowash but even that is second to this one.Because there are no silicones my hair is TRULY moisturized.  I got great softness and definition with my regimen. You would think gel would leave it crunchy, but when you have a great rinse out conditioner and leave in, you can scrunch your hair once it dries and it comes out SUPER soft and defined.  My hair was REALLY hydrated AND soft. Ok, I need to stop, you get the point.  But I hope they never discontinue this.  However I am now grateful that Redken discontinued Smooth Down, I can't believe what I was missing.  I mean really... my friends know me.  Spending $4.77 per bottle at Walmart??? I can't beleive how good this stuff is.  I heard it was great before the formula change, but from what I hear, it can be used as a leave in better now because there's no rubbing alcohol in it anymore."
7267,1,big_kinda thick. It works good but too thick for my  taste. Will buy again and again.Love the jar and it is big
9944,1,"The Best Sleeping Mask I've Ever Used!!!_*** Note: I received a free sample product in exchange for an honest review. ***I frequently travel both nationally and internationally and I always try to get a little bit of sleep on the flights - even if its just a short nap.  My bedroom also has a south-facing window and there are frequent nights where the moonlight is quite strong through the blinds.  As such I've tried several different brands/styles of sleeping masks.  Typically the sleeping masks are too tight across my eyes and don't completely block the light.The Trendy Swede Sleeping Mas, in my estimation, is the best sleeping mask out there.  Not on does it have concave pockets for your eyes (so that it isn't too tight and/or sweaty) and a nice molded nose space (as opposed to other masks that are flat and allow light to come up around your nose), but it is also made of a super soft black fabric over a comfy foam internal layer.  With the adjustable straps, I was also able to release the mask a little bit so that I wouldn't wake up with marks all over my face from a too-tight-mask (unlike your typical sleeping mask which is not adjustable).  Finally - and most importantly - the eye mask basically blocks ALL THE LIGHT that is in the room.  I even wore this during the day to take a nap and considering how dark they were, it could have been midnight for all I knew.  Finally the draw-string travel bag is awesome!!  Its made of a similar soft/silky material and is large enough to hold the mask without it being super tight and the draw string tightly secures the bag closed.  This addition is definitely a great bonus.The package includes the two masks and travel bag as well as three pairs of foam ear plugs - which on some of my airplane flights, I could have really used...  Considering the different kinds of higher priced masks that I've tried in the store or purchased and didn't like, the $12.99 price is an absolute bargain/steal - especially with the SWEET travel bag!  Even if the sleeping mask looks and feels somewhat like you are wearing a small bra on your eyes, I don't care - The Trendy Swede Sleeping Mask is awesome!!!"
8261,1,"My outdoor man_My sweetheart works outdoors and the winds and sun and blowing dirt are rough on his handsome face.  I have been trying to get him to use my face cream on his face and he looked at me like I had three heads.  This is made for men and so heas agreeable.  It was made by dove, so I thought it would be of quality.  I like that it completely absorbs into his face and is not greasy.  It is lightly scented.  If he doesn't wear anything else it's pleasant and clean.  If he wears cologne it simple fades out.  I don't like that there is no SPF.  I think there should be.  He has a beard and this does not create a buildup in his beard, it mixes in well, and makes his beard softer.  His one complaint is that when he has been wind burned and then uses this lotion there is an instant burn feel.  So I would assume if your face is extremely sensitive this may not be the gentlest solution."
4540,0,"Definitely not good on curly or thick hair, but works on already straight or flat hair._I have very thick, very long, and very wavy hair for a man, so I'm always looking for shampoos or conditioners that can straighten my hair so I don't have to resort to a straightening iron. So far the best I've found is Herbal Essences 'Dangerously Straight.' However I'm always looking for something new. When I got the chance to review this conditioner and the accompanying shampoo,Pantene Pro-v Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy To Smooth Conditioner, 12.6-ounce (Pack of 6)I jumped at the chance.Unfortunately, thie shampoo does not hold up under fire. In fact, instead of unfrizzing my hair, it turned my head into a giant mass of snarls and knots. The hair actually curled up more and made my hair a living nightmare. The conditioner helped somewhat, but this was one of the worst shampoo experiences of my life. It was painful trying to get all the snarls out post shower. I'd hate to think what it would have been like WITHOUT the conditioner. Either way, neither product prevented frizzing and they actually made my hair a tangled mess.With that in mind, you're probably wondering why I didn't give this a one star. Well, my girlfriend has very straight hair and we tried it on her and it actually gave her hair body. So on two different people the shampoo and conditioner did the opposite of what it was supposed to. With me, it was horrific, but with her, it actually gave her the effect she normally looks for in hair products that are supposed to add body.So take note Pantene - rebrand who is supposed to get this conditioner, and you have a winner. For people like myself who have medium-thick hair and are looking for something to get the curls and friz out, do NOT try this or you will regret it horribly."
5549,1,it smells so good._got this for my dad. it smells so good.
6615,1,"My number 1 conditioner to combat dry/damaged hair_I first saw this conditioner at the H.E.B. Central Market in Houston. It was recommended by the health/beauty professional working in that department. So after carefully noting all of the wonderful ingredients in the conditioner, I purchased it. I immediately wanted to see if this product would live up to its claim. So I washed my hair and applied this conditioner and was absolutely AMAZED. I am an Black woman who loves her natural kinky curly hair and wanted an all natural product to combat dryness and to aid in damage control. This is the product for me. It has a medium almond smell which comes from the almond extract ingredient. The product has a medium to light consistency, smells wonderful. But the best thing I LOVE about this conditioner is when you first apply it to your hair, it tingles in a wonderful way. I can tell it's working. It makes my hair soft & touchable with a light smell (that I love). So for all of my natural kinky, coily, and curly friends, this is your new product and it works."
6181,1,"e.l.f. 144 Piece Eyeshadow Palette, Neutral, 20.5 Ounce_This was a gift to a budding young make-up artist.  Evidently e.l.f. is a great brand and also inexpensive.  Lots of beautiful colors."
3720,1,"New user; fabulous results_My test of any new shampoo is how my hair feels and looks after washing without any conditioner or additional product. My hair is waist length, undyed and unprocessed, half white/half brown. It is probably a 1B texture. It is prone to a halo of frizz in humid weather.This shampoo has a thick texture and to my nose a very mild pleasant smell. The scent is slightly coconut and does not linger on my hair. It lathers easily and rinses out quickly. I found that my hair was comb-able right away and I was able to part it without snarls which is unusual for me.Dry, my hair is soft, shiny and with almost no frizz. The ends are not fly-away. Because I wash my hair daily, it is hard to find a shampoo that leaves my hair with this much shine.Even thought I might be an off label user, I like this product so much that I would make it my every day, go-to shampoo. I do not see it in my local grocery/department stores but I'd be willing to order it online to purchase. The bottle has a good heft to it (not likely to be knocked over) and the graphics are cheerful. This is a great product that I highly recommend."
3818,1,"Excellent Detangling Comp_This detangling comp is great. It is solid enough so that it will not break at hard spots. Even my hair is quite long, I still can work it all out with this great detangling comp. I love it for I feeling I got when using it with conditioning creams or hair masks."
8096,1,"Nice smelling, lightweight._This is a good sunscreen -- it provided the protection of any 30 SPF sunscreen I've tried but in a much lighter weight, non-greasy formula and without that horrible sunscreen smell that usually gives me a headache. The cooling-on-contact feature did work but of course doesn't last very long when you're out at the beach and your skin just warms back up! The only downside to this sunscreen is that for some reason it made me sweat -- for five to ten minutes after applying it, the areas I had just applied the sunscreen to sweatted heavily."
2166,1,smell_smells really really good and makes your hair silky i love this product and how it looks also glad i bought this
1758,1,"Multi-purpose_Really creates a good brown smokey eye when needed, it isn't too strong so it's great for daytime when I just need some neutral colour on my lids too. It lines my lids great too. Easy to use and affordable. Kudos Covergirl."
6766,1,"Thumbs up!_LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT! Great price, came quickly! Put them on an empty scotch tape dispenser for easy use! So much fun!"
7183,1,great_love the color and the quality. it looks good on the fingers and being so close to skin colour i can use it at work as well..
5238,1,Love this product!_Fab just like the original one I bought from the store! Perfect for evening or daytime looks. I totally recommend this product!
7089,1,"Product helped to reduce sun damage_I am a medium toned Caucasian woman in my early 30's with significant sun damage to my face from tanning in a bed for several years. I have pigment issues and dark spots. I used this peel to help with that and its actually worked to 'fade' the dark spots a good bit. They aren't gone completely but are much better.Follow the directions in the bottle. I can now use the peel more often but the first few times it made my skin burn and flake. Do not leave it on too long the first application. Overall, I thought this was well worth the money."
5941,1,"Make sure you aren't looking for the foundation sized guards_I like these, but I was actually looking for the foundation sized ones. Luckily I just bought a slew of eye brushes and used all of these. There are the second smallest size guards (out of the 4 possible sizes). I thought the sizes went (in descending order) Kabuki, Blush, Foundation, Eyeshadow, but they actually go Kabuki, Foundation, Blush, Eyeshadow."
2762,1,Best Cleanser in the World for Dry Skin_This Cetaphil skin cleanser is just awesome. It's really gentle for sensitive skin and it even moisturizes for drier skin types. I have used this cleanser for years now because of my really dry skin and it's the only cleanser that ever left my skin with the not dry/parched feeling after done washing my face. It's really great and gentle but still effective! It's really low cost and even the more expensive brands I have used still don't work as well as cetaphil!
296,1,"Excellent product_I have known this product for 20 years; the good thing is they have not changed the formula, which is great; probably one of the best creams out there! The only thing they have changed is the packaging. Very natural product, no bad stuff in it!"
8083,1,"Fun colors for spring_I love the OPI mini sets, allowing me to try new colors without adding full sized bottles to my already large collection of polishes. You're such a budapest, suzy's hungary again and don't touch my czechbook are beautiful spring into summer colors, opaque in 2 coats and would be fun for nail art. Oy another polish joke is kind of the oddball here being a yellow-toned glitter but can be saved for another time. Oy is best used over something else as it is pretty sheer. Overall very happy having these colors for spring."
7792,1,I would use this again._Great quality and smooth application. Long lasting and not at all gritty. It is a great product for the price.
8834,0,Greasy!_I used to use the gel which wasn't greasy and slippery on my face. They discontinued it. This is its replacement and you vacant wear it under makeup like the gel. I wish they would PLEASE bring back the gel!
5764,1,love it_great brush at a great price. I decided to try this brush because of the good reviews. I am glad that i did. Good quality and no shedding.
8781,1,"Fantastic conditioner for those who want straight hair_I have very thick hair with curls that are often difficult to straighten.  I so thrilled I discovered Motions Straight Finish Leave in Conditioner!The straight finish conditioner is the second step in a process designed to help more easily straighten hair.  After washing my hair with the cleanser, I towel dried it a bit, as the directions stated.  I then worked the conditioner into my hair while combing the curls.  The product was light and easy to spread.  It acted as a fantastic detangler, and I could tell a difference in the curliness of my damp hair.Motions is known for being a great brand of African American hair products, and the Straight Finish Conditioner is a great addition!"
5213,1,"love it_yes I use this once a month on my face to expoliate to rid dead skin, I use with warm water and rinse my face in cold water to close the pores.....Korean do that 424 regime.google it...I expoliate for 44 seconds."
4266,1,Love love love!_I adore Bare Minerals products - I use the entire line! I started with this product and I've never used another beauty line because this foundation is absolutely amazing. My skin has improved so much in the last few months. I'll never use anything else!
4087,1,"The wife liked it!_For risk of losing my man card, I gave this to my wife to test.The cream/gel texture and scent of this product are nice. Apply only a small amount and add if you need more since it can render hair greasy. I have applied on damp and on dry hair and both ways work very well. I have also used this cream prior to blow drying and my hair did seem to shine a bit more. It is not the extreme shine which I was expecting though, but overall it is a very good product for frizz control and to keep hair nice and smooth."
1784,1,"I like what I see..._I was amazed by the reviews, so I purchased a bottle!  (crazy shipping cost, but oh well)I've used this product about 11 times now, and I like the results so far!My pimples aren't so out of control, and I definitely see more of a smooth & toned complexion.  The acne marks are slightly fading as well.My purchase also came with a free collagen facial cleansing gel.  Love it!  My face actually feels soft and moisturized as I'm washing/rinsing.  That NEVER happens!  It's such a nice feeling.Back to the prep skin refresher.Once applied, I did not feel any sort of burning, but sometimes there is a bit of an itchy feeling.  Goes away once you smooth on a moisturizer, so it's no big deal.Anyway, I am recovering from a horrible, horrible breakout and I feel more confident in my skin after using these 2 gems.I will continue to buy (even though they're a tad expensive, but I can see why!)Thanks & best of luck!"
3711,0,"Kerastase Reflection By Kerastase Chrom Thermique Thermo Radiance_I had used the Kerastace Nectar Thermique, prior to purchasing this product.  The person selling itadvised me that this would be better to use since I color my hair.  To my disappointment, it is not halfthe product the Nectar Thermique is and for the same money, I'd like to return it to exchange it for theNectar Thermique.  No comparison.."
6831,1,"I use this when grooming my dog._I use this when grooming my dog. It helps in keeping the long hair tame in the winter. I am careful about using this product in places where my dog might lick, as it contains macadamia nut oil. The product is inexpensive compared to other dog grooming oils that I have purchased."
2306,1,Conditions eyelashes and eye brows._I only just started using this product. So I can not say if it will work on thickening lashes. It does make lashes feel silky.
6768,1,Nice colours_The tapes are good quality and you can use them for days. The colours are really nice and they are easy to work with.
4000,1,"Love this Daring lipgloss_I love this gloss!  I used to use Clinique's almost lipstick in black honey but was looking for a cheaper replacement since they were about $20 a tube.  I was a hardcore department store makeup mavin before having children and am now always on the lookout for terrific buys outside the mall.This CG Lipslick is very close to my beloved black honey and I can really save my cash.  I just swipe it on and it gives the perfect berry/wine flush to my lips and is smooth and shiny without stickiness. It is not as dark as it looks in the tube. I actually like this shade better with my complexion than my former favorite.I adore the 2 packs sold here on amazon; I keep one in the downstairs bath and one in my purse so I can slap it on and run.  I have two kids under 3 years old and so you can imagine the lack of any time I have to spend on getting myself presentable and feeling polished when we venture out of the house.It helps make this tired mommy feel a bit more girly, refreshed AND frugal ;)"
1998,1,Love this set_I am in love with this shampoo and conditioner. I use it on my one year old too. It's tingly greatness and smells amazing.
9367,1,"Real stuff!_Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial. &lt;a href='http://www.tomoson.com/?code=TOP64a220b0613b39cc208139245fa0f32b' rel='nofollow'>&lt;/a>I love to use oil for my hair. This oil is super hydrating, its pure extra virgin argan oil & you can tell with the first use itself that this stuff is real, & works wonders on my hair. it can be used on skin too, but i use it for my hair which is very dry & It works great as  a deep conditioner.I sometimes also use just a drop of it as a leave in. I always prefer using natural products in my hair , sulfate free shampoos, I am really glad to find this product which is 100 % natural, no added fragrance, etc & also works great at the same time.Learn more about this product here [...]I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &lt;a href='http://www.tomoson.com/?code=BOTTOM64a220b0613b39cc208139245fa0f32b' rel='nofollow'>Tomoson.com&lt;/a>. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers."
4095,1,"Liked The Formula But I Got The Wrong Shade_I guess I got the wrong shade. I thought Nude would be a good in between shade. I saw some swatches online and most of the other shades looked too dark, and the Ivory looked too light. Maybe I need to try their Vanilla or Shell to really be certain.I wasn't too crazy the pump dispenser, I'd rather have a twist off/twist on lid so that I can get into the bottle with a brush and scrap out what I need.It went on smooth and blended out nice, if only it were the right shade."
1352,1,"Love it_This is a great face lotion. I just noticed that it's mislabeled as lipstick somehow but I got moisturizer. I really like it! It has a nice, light scent and doesn't feel heavy on my skin. Absorbs in quickly and I like that it has SPF so I can use it in the morning! The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is the bottle. It's not squeezable so I transferred it to a container that I had in my house, which would allow me to more easily access the lotion. Seriously, this bottle is really awful but you can definitely get it all out and into another container if you want to! Not sure if I'll buy it again just because the bottle is inconvenient but I do really like the product inside!"
9619,1,So far so good!_I have been using for a few days! Very gentle on skin. Makes it smooth and soft. Like so far!!!
4907,1,"A great deep conditioner for med thick hair_Love this product as a deep conditioner, but my other favorites are:* Organix Argan Oil Deep Conditioner (you can buy the Macadamia Nut Oil and add to any deep conditioner)* Macadamia Nut Oil Deep Conditioner* Palmer's Coconut Oil Formula Protein Pack* Vidal Sassoon Protein Conditioner"
4347,1,"Great_Who would have thought it made a difference what kind of nail clippers you use?  Well, I know now, and these are great!  My nails are hard as a rock, and these clip them like butter.  So nice"
6426,1,"A Makeup Artist's Must-Have_These were an absolute bargain at the price I paid. I have bought from other places and paid a lot more for a lot less.I use them for tinting brows and lashes, but they are also great for applying mascara.They separate lashes well, and because they are disposable , they help keep your mascara free from germs. A must for professional makeup artists or anyone who wants to keep their mascara free of contamination."
6729,1,"Easy to carry, easy to use._As someone who has those oily T-zone issues, I can count on one or more trips to the restroom per day to deal with it. Powder compacts were always a problem because the extra powder can leave my face looking dried out, and oilier spots get more powder stuck to them and my makeup winds up looking looks cakey and uneven. Not to mention they crumble up and mess up my purse sometimes. I don't have those problems with this product though and it works very well. It leaves my face looking like I gently washed off the oil without washing off my makeup. I don't know exactly how it works, but it does work and I like it."
716,1,"my favorite perfume of all times_I have been using it for... uhh.. fifteen years?!It is the best blend of sweetness, spice, musk and character I have ever smelled.There are so many perfumes, especially in the last decade, being launched, and they all smell so similar! They have so little character, and if they do, then they are either too weird, or too something. Or they give me a headache.This one is unique. Guaranteed."
4988,1,"Perfect For Color Treated Hair_I have used WEN for the past 4 years on my color treated, fine hair. My hair stylist always raves about how my color stays and hold up in between salon visits. It always gives me the right amount of cleaning and conditioning. Highest recommendations!"
1498,1,"Monster of a curling iron_I've had many curling irons throughout the years and wanted a curling iron with a bigger barrel since I have hair about 3 inches past my shoulders and didn't want a curly look most of the time.  My hair tends to be on the fine side - fine hair, lots of it - so I try to be careful about what heating tools I will use on it.  It is also highlighted so it can get damaged pretty easily.  Back to the iron.  Apparently I was wrong in thinking that I had owned a 2 inch barrel curling iron before.  I must have had 1 1/2 inch irons because when I took this monster out of the box I was surprised to see how truly big this thing is.  I'm trying to find something in my office right now to compare it to give you an idea of the circumference.  I have a can of Aqua Net (hey, it was on sale at CVS and I needed hairspray to keep at work) under my desk and the cap on it is about the same circumference.  The size of this iron makes it a bit cumbersome at times to use.  But I think the more I use it, the easier it will be.  It has numerous heat settings which is good because as I mentioned I have fine hair and fine hair and heat are not a good mix.  It heated up quickly but I did notice the first two times I used it, I turned it off without realizing it trying to maneuver this mammoth iron.  I used it on the fine setting, which is the lowest, and kept it in place for about 10 seconds.  After a few uses, I will say that I also have an issue with turning it off and sometimes changing the settings without even realizing it.  That can be annoying when you are in a hurry and your hair isn't curling anymore because the iron is off and now cool and has to reheat.  Back to the curl - if you are looking for big, loose curls, I don't think this is the iron for you.  I am using it more so to smooth out my hair - I do a quick upside down dry for volume and it needs a bit of taming down.  If I use a straight iron, I get a really flat look.  This smooths my hair and leaves it with volume.  I start from the top and work my way down.  It curls the ends in a bit but I would not say that my hair looks curled.  It takes time to get used to it because of the size.  I also wish the cord were just a little bit longer but that is not enough to make me discontinue using it.  I won't give it 5 stars because of the awkwardness of it - but it is a 2 inch curling iron."
42,1,"Love the lotion_I love this lotion- it stays on through a hand washing and it sinks in well.  However they changed the lid on it recently to a screw on lid (used to be a flip top) and I dinged it a star for that.  The new lid is VERY cumbersome (big lid, tiny hole to match up to the screw thingy).  I am always dropping them on the floor!Anyway the lotion is great if you are constantly washing your hands!"
3147,1,"Perfect Exfoliating Glove_I bought the beldi soap and argan oil from Zakia.  They are wonderful.  I chose this glove to go with them.  What came off of my skin is rather gross.  My skin was old and gray looking.  I am still old but my whole body is clean, fresh and pink.  I no longer have itching due to  old skin hanging on over newer skin.  It is amazing.  An incredible glove!"
2243,1,Love the thin brush_I actually bought this brush to use when applying Latisse to my eyelash line. It is perfect! I'm sure it would be great for a discrete application of eyeliner.
4313,1,"Light and smooth_The Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum is decent product for the money.  It goes on smoothly and feels very light on your skin.  It even has a nice scent.  It isn't heavy like a lot of the creams on the market.  Many similar products are very expensive, but the Olay products are much more affordable.  As far as how well this seems to work...it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't an overnight miracle cream either.  I have sensitive skin and it didn't cause any break outs or skin allergies.  After several weeks of applying this product daily, my face seemed softer, but it didn't smooth ever imperfection my face.  I can't speak to how this product would work for long term use, but I would recommend it if you are looking for softer, more supple skin.  Overall, it is worthwhile product.  Olay's products work well and are a good value."
3549,1,good for price_Great deal. The brushes are made well. I have not had any problems with them sheading or a strange smell as others have posted. But i will say the &#34;eye shadow&#34;brushes are a bit stiff.
9550,1,"Beats Trader Blows_My wife has been buying face wash for the shower from Trader Joes.  I guess I'm used to watery, non-foaming hippie wash and anything is an improvement.  The Axe Peace wash lathers up very nicely, even with a small dab of soap.  It feels 'clean' and like has a pleasant, slightly citrus-y scent.  I'm not a fan of the theme.  Every time I pick up the bottle and see a giant peace symbol I cringe.  Weird marketing, but I like the overall product quite a bit."
8275,1,"The only concealer that works on my under eye circles!_I have SEVERE under eye circles and have never found a concealer that works on them.  I've tried all sorts of highlighting effects, colors, techniques, etc. and still find myself having to cake on layers and layers of concealer, only to still have visible circles.  Enter Glamoflauge.I bought this product for $6 at Walmart, but would gladly pay the Amazon price if Walmart decides not to carry it in the future.  This concealer has been life changing for me!  The first time I tried it, I was impressed by the coverage, but found that it looked pretty cakey.  Then I watched a youtube video review of the product in which the young woman dabbed the concealer over her entire under eye area (this is similar to the upside-down triangle technique and creates a highlighted effect).  Once I tried dabbing it on instead of spreading it around or brushing it on, it really looked great.  I topped it off with a LIGHT dusting of powder, and it looked very smooth.  Best of all, I don't have to keep layering the stuff on - just one pass of dabbing the product really does the trick.  I sometimes will add a light dusting of a shimmery eyeshadow to highlight the area even more, but it isn't necessary.  My circles are so dark that nothing will cover them up 100 percent, but Glamoflauge comes closer than any product I've ever tried, and I'm 30 years old, so I have years of trying to fix this problem under my belt.I don't find the pencil to be hard to use, as other reviewers have mentioned, but the color is slightly darker than the concealer.  The concealer color I got was 'Ultra Light,' which comes with a pencil in the color, 'Light.' For this reason, it won't work for my under eye circles (I'm very fair-skinned), but it is awesome on small pimples.  I tend to have eczema breakouts on my face at this time of year, and the concealer and pencil both cover all that up without adding a bunch of buildup that would attract the eye to the problem.  Glamoflauge couldn't come at a better time, as I am in the public eye, but not so much that I can afford to have a makeup artist all the time.  Overall, this is an awesome product and I really hope it is never discontinued!"
3740,0,"Waste of time and money_I have tried so many times to stamp on my nails with this product with no results whatsoever.  Tried expensive nail polish, cheap ones and everything in between and images never transfers complete. Not even with Konad polish. The scrapper scratched all my plates as well.Very disappointed."
8014,1,"Great foundation!_I started using this foundation about a month ago and I have not stopped using it since. This is my go-to foundation and I use it daily.I have oily/combination skin and this keeps me non-shiny and smooth all day.PROS:-Stays on ALL day, doesn't smudge or slide.-Color matches well and they have a good color selection.-Sets quickly, stays matte all day.-Works great with oily/combination skin.CONS:-Has good coverage, but I still need concealer for my under-eye area.I would highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to spend too much on foundation but is looking for a foundation that is wonderful!"
2942,1,"GREAT!_Update :10/1/12  Love this set! Very little fall out. They work so wellI'm loving these brushes more and more all the time. They are so soft, and no matter how much I wash them they don't shed. Great brushes!These brushes are so soft, and yet still pretty dense. They all work so well. I'm very pleased about these, I'll probably order more soon :)"
380,1,"NARS blush for nc42/43 skin tone_When searching for appropriate colors in nars blush for my skin tone it wasn't so easy! So I'm writing this not only to review these blushes but as a color guide to anyone with a medium dark complexion.It's important not to go too light because the blush WILL look chalky or there will be no color payoff. So far these colors have been most flattering1. Mata hariMatte mauve pink. Gorgeous for everyday adds a natural looking flush to the cheeks. It is lighter than MAC slave to love blush which was one of my old favorites before I tried NARS!2. TaosDescribed as a dusty rose, but has coral tones on my skin tone. Has some shimmer but not very noticeable once applied to the skin. This one is very long lasting. Nice for brightening up your day...and your complexion!3. Taj mahalLooks very gold in the pan but adds such a pretty warmth to the cheeks that's a little shimmery and lit from within. There are many ravs about this blush on beauty blogs and YouTube and its true!4. DesireA scary bright bright bright pink in the pan but also very good quality giving cheeks the natural flush you crave for everyday. I've also seen this one on deeper skin tones and it still looks natural and flattering5. Love joyI was wondering if this would show up or just look like shimmer on my skin. After application it was a brownish berry color with slight shimmer and the blush I choose when I'm doing a strong smoky or colorful eye look. Looks very natural on my skin tone. Can't really be used to contour because it has the berry tone. The nars site describes this of a bronzed rose but on skin tones similar to mine would be berry toned.6. Exhibit AI've seen this on light medium and deep skin tones and it is widely flattering! Turns more red than orange on my skin but can look more orange on you depending on your undertones. Every woman should have this one in their arsenal. Some people believe this gives the most natural looking flush of all. It also photographs really well and looks good on video! Lol :)Start your collection with any one of these if you're skin tone is similar to mine. NARS blush is one of the best blush brands out there I encourage you to try at least one even thought they have a higher price point. They are very pigmented and last a long time too!"
4638,1,"It stays on for hours and I really like the color_I received my Revlon Just Bitten Lipstain and Balm, Twilight 0.09 ounces. It stays on for hours and I really like the color. I would order again from Revlon Consumer Products Corp.Thank you,MLP"

6339,0,"Don't like texture, creamy but oily and not a good smell_Been using this cream every night for a week or so now and can't say that I notice anything but even if that takes time, I don't care for the texture or the smell or the feel of the cream. I am very selective, as you should be too, about what you put on your skin and I feel this is just not the right quality. Giving it a 2 1/2 stars but rounding down to 2."
8551,1,A NICE SCENT WITH A SMOOTH FEEL_First I would like to say that I have been using Dove soaps for many years and I wouldn't think of using any other soaps in the shower. I love how smooth they feel without leaving my skin dry and most of their fragances are fresh and soothing.I tried this new scent and I really liked it. The color of the soap is a pretty lavander and the scent is not too strong but just enough to give a fresh and flowery aroma. I would highly recommend this soap especially if you like Dove soaps!
3941,1,"A MUST HAVE!!!!_Even though this palette took a long time to ship, I must say that this is one of the best products out there. Mainly because it offers a wide variety of colors in a compact, slim case, which is great. It has a great mix of neutral and standard colors, as well as bright, eye-catching colors. I can't wait until summer and spring so I can really use all the colors and have fun with it. Also, all the colors are very pretty and pigmented and I just can't get enough of it!!"
4435,1,"How to purchase a legit GHD like mine!_Okay so to begin I wanted a GHD being the top of the line hair straightener in competition with the sudo but I didnt want to pay the $200 price tag so Amazon was my best choice.I want to say my previous hair straightener was a Solia which is also one of the top hair straightener and I purchased it straight from folica.comCompared to the solia the GHD defiantly beats it and I'm very happy I purchased it.A lot of complaints for the GHD was that people kept getting FAKE non legit ones, I am happy to say I received a legit GHD and you can too.The best way to know if it is legit whether it comes from Amazon or not is to check the sellers reviews (always do so). I usually buy from those who have usually more then 1000 reviews and score at least a 97%. That is how you know whether you are getting the real deal.Second, when you receive it, to test its authenticity sign up for its warranty from the little paper they give you included. If it has the shiny sticker inside the clasps of the straightener it is most likely the real deal but to make sure you should sign up for again, its warranty. If it goes through, congrats you have a REAL GHD!This is how you can tell if your GHD is a FAKE FAKE FAKE!-if it is made in china (it is manufactured in P.R.C. or South Korea)-if the warranty does not work-if you do not have the shiny sticker in itAlso, be cautious when buying from a third party seller.Also, the warranty will most likely be voided if you buy from Amazon, but you should still sign up for it to check for its authenticity.Hope this helped guys"
4235,0,"Mineral Not Physical..._Burnout's Ocean Tested mix has some organic ingredients but this is not an acceptable mix for a high ZO. BurnOut is uzing the ZO mix as a marketing tool to sell chemicals to individuals who do not read the ingredients or have no idea about ingredients. From alcohol to gum to hardeners. I make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not, I need the same formula as I use in my organic sunscreen mix with fewer ingredients. Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection.Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide (non-nano) 18.9%Other Ingredients: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Polysorbate 60, Stearic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Stearate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Stearyl Alcohol, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Ricinoleate, Isostearic Acid, Lecithin, Xanthan Gum, Carrageenan, Helionori, Punica Granatum (Pomegranate) Extract, Plantago Lanceolata (Plantain) Leaf Extract, Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C), Ethylhexylglycerin.Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin's DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful of 90% plus certified organic ingredients and FREE OF; fragrances, perfumes, additives, softeners, thickening agents, gums, alcohol, biologically harmful chemicals like Avobenzone, Oxybenzone, UV Chemical absorbers, paraben, phthalates, PABA and 1,4 dioxane. BABO has 22% ZO with conventional not organic ingredients which is a higher amount of ZO than an organic brand like BADGER with 18.5% ZO. But ZO is not the only ingredient in BABO so there are few issues with BABO formula. ZO is like mud, the higher, the better protection but ZO stays on the surface of the skin for protection so for many, high ZO will not work since it will be too heavy. One needs to try different mixes to find the mix acceptable to them based on ingredients, feel and performance. For a small investment, sunscreens may offer the possibility of sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with skin exposure to the sun."
4019,0,"Don't waste your money_There are multiple problems with this product:1- it dispenses too much at a time, you end up wasting half the product.2- it does NOT keep eye makeup from creasing.  The color stays, but I still get a crease.3- looks cakey4- for those with fair skin and light bags under your eyes, it is too light to be used as an all day concealer.  But, if you use concealer over it you get raccoon eyes.Don't waste your money on this.  There are far better eyelid primers."

3106,1,"Loved The Retractable Part, But..._This was a great product until one day the retractable part broke and I had to throw it away. I don't even know how it happened, but I didn't abuse the product to happen that way."
580,1,"Works pretty well_My skin starting breaking out pretty terribly, worse than it had in years, soon after I got pregnant. Once my dr. gave benzoyle peroxide the 'OK', I ordered this kit. It has returned my skin to normal - which for me means just a few minor blemishes here and there. I'm no longer embarrassed!A downside to all benzoyle products is the bleaching of fabric. I have avoided this so far by switching towels, using the wash only in the shower, and using the lotion only at night with old T-shirts and white sheets. Once a day is half of what's recommended, but works for me.I haven't used Proactive in years, but I am at least as pleased with this product now as I was with Proactive as a teen. It's VERY similar, and certainly cheaper, esp with Subscribe & Save."
3458,1,"Officially a convert!  LOVE IT!!!_I bought this product on the advice of a friend and after the first time using it, I am officially in love!  Absolutely no creasing of my eyeshadow and eyeshadow in general looks so much more vibrant.  It last all day and I will never go without this product again!"

5157,1,Great value_I discovered L'Oreal Paris Youth Code Regenerating Skincare Serum Intense Daily Treatment through Allure's list of award winning products.  I hadn't expected Youth Code to feel so smooth but I immediately felt that it moisturized and gave my skin radiance.  I've become a big fan - it's one of those products that gives you department store quality for drugstore prices.
5716,1,"Red Jello Candy - Oh so pretty, and decadent, cured under LED lamp too_This is my absolute favorite color. It is bloody red, vampires will drool over this. Hard to imagine how CND gets this color to be translucent, like jello candy, not opaque. Color does not match bottle - the bottle looks darker and more brown. I prefer this color over wildfire which has a tint of orange and more opaque. Cured 1 minute under LED lamp. Red is difficult color to apply in general but as long as you go with thin layer it will cure fine, otherwise it can run to the side/cuticle before you cure it."

6670,1,"Great combination of sunscreen and moisturizer_Actually used this when we went to the beach last time and it worked great as a protectant and also a nice lotion. Why didn't the sunscreen companies think of this ages ago? Smells good and doesn't seem like you are applying sunscreen (if that makes sense.) Applying sunscreen always feels like a chore, and this makes it less so. Highly recommended."
7318,0,"Caused serious hair loss_My husband has used Head & Shoulders anti-dandruff shampoo for a good 15 years, so I thought it would be interesting to have him try this product. After a week, I asked him what he thought and, in his typically manly-man fashion, he shrugged. 'It's OK, but I don't use it anymore,' he said. After a bit of prodding and asking specific questions, I found out that he noticed a significant increase in the amount of hair in the shower drain after he washed his hair with this product. For this reason alone after three days he stopped using the product completely. He also commented that his hair didn't have that 'clean hair smell' after shampooing.I will add that I purchased another CLEAR SCALP THERAPY product for my own use, and had absolutely the same problem -- a noticeable (seriously noticeable) amount of hair in the shower drain after shampooing. I don't know if this is a problem with all CLEAR products, but it has been with the two that we've tried.This will not be a product we will buy in the future, as we both found it causes serious loss of hair. I now have two full bottles of this product (one for men, one for women) and neither will be used again."
527,1,"Totally Worth It!_If my house caught on fire, I would run back in to get this hair dryer.  I didn't think a dryer would make that much of a difference in the health, style and look of my hair.  When I tearfully confessed that I was thinking of going to my natural hair color (gasp! no!), my hairdresser suggested I upgrade from my $15.00 travel sized dryer.What an amazing decision.  I looked at $80.00 dryers, but there didn't seem to be much difference between a $20.00 dryer and an $80.00 dryer.  Then I picked up this dryer, my new best friend, my secret weapon, my happy place...It cuts drying time.  It makes your hair soft, smooth and silky.  It sings you a song while you put on your makeup.  Well, maybe not the last one.  But, in all honesty, this is one of the best beauty purchases I've made.  Ever."
344,1,"Fun smelly soap_This isn't a gentle or moisturizing soap -- I don't use it on my body much less my face. But it's cheap, it smells good, and it looks cute stacked in baskets or big jars (plus it has wrappers that are great for decoupage), so why not grab some for the kitchen sink?Not to mention that if you grate it or soak it in warm water overnight, it makes a great scented laundry soap for all your natural fibers -- you can have all your clothes or linens smell like sandalwood. Or scrub your linen shelves with it ad have *those* smell spiffy."

The benefits of having this mirror in the shower is Easy to see where you are shaving and no mess on the floor afterwards.

8600,1,ok_Lysol touch of foam  soap is not too bad. The only complaint I have on this product is that after you've washed your hands it dries the skin out extremely and if you do not have any hand cream my hands become rough and cracked. The soap itself is a pleasant smell and it does foam as it says it will it leaves no residue on your hands so they feel gummy or sticky. I'm not sure I would buy this on a regular basis unless I was trying to take precautions during a flu or cold so I would not pass on my germs. Outside of those thoughts I think I'll probably just stick with what I currently use as I do have very sensitive skin.I hope this recommendation and my opinion is helpful!
726,0,"No coverage at all._This powder is more like translucent powder rather than a base.  It has very light coverage that does not last more than a couple of hours (if that long).  The color is a bit pasty and flat and simply sits on the surface.  While using the foam pad included with it, most of the product remains on the pad, while using a brush to apply, it flies all over the place with product loss.  I feel that it is best applied with your face a bit moist in order to secure the powder in place.  Personally I will not purchase again, I am not happy with the quality."
6988,1,One pump is all u need_SKIN79 BB Cleanser with Skin Detox Effect I really like this face wash cleans my face but doesn't over dry and u only need one pump to do ur face with. Takes off makeup and is a nice addition to my daily needs. Very happy with this cleanser ^.^

5313,1,Great Sunscreen for breakout prone skin_Since I hit my 30's I've had issues with breakouts and I have to be very careful with what products I use on my face. I have tried many facial sunscreens bad this is my current favorite.  It's lightweight and wears well under my makeup. The best part is that it doesn't cause my face to breakout any more. Great find!
5542,1,"Teenage Dream - super holographic sparkle_Before buying Teenage Dream, I looked over tons of photos and read a lot of descriptions but somehow missed that this contains quite a lot of holographic glitter. It's a bit too eye-catching on my entire nail unless it's a holiday or a party (even under fluorescent lighting, it catches and reflects light like nobody's business), but for everyday, I do like using this to paint on a bling-bling pink French tip on my toe nails. That's just the right amount of sparkle for me. The really nice thing about this polish is that it's PACKED with glitter... with this, I don't need to build up thick layers of polish to get the dense coverage of glitter I want. Just one coat is all I use - there's still visible nail line with 1 coat which doesn't bother me, but if VNL bothers you 2 coats will do the trick (or use a coat of white nail polish as your base, then put Teenage Dream over that)."
9038,1,LOVE_I got it for my back and i LOVE IT! it gets my whole back with ease and its not to soft but not to hard...its JUST RIGHT!
1813,1,"Really does make a difference_I bought this product after doing tons of research on flat irons.  I was so paranoid that I would end up damaging my hair, but loved the look that a flat iron achieved on my short, prone to random waviness, locks.  I've used the thermal guard almost every time I use the flat iron and my hair is in fantastic condition.  Granted, I do let it go au natural on the weekends and whenever possible, but still end up flat ironing at least three to four times a week.  On the days I don't use the thermal guard, I notice that my hair seems frizzier and doesn't have the healthy bounce that usually accompanies heat styling.  While this product will never replace my beloved though discontinued Thermasilk Heat Guard, due to its sticky texture that really only makes it suitable for direct heat applications, its day-to-day performance ranks it as one of my styling 'Must Haves.'  The only detractor...and it's a personal one...is the smell.  Others rave about its scent, but I'm put off by the strong aroma of men's cologne or aftershave that this product has.  As such, I always make sure to style my hair early in my morning routine so as to allow it to dissipate some before applying my own feminine perfume."
6247,1,Awsome_This is my favorite Garnier Fructis conditioner! it smells so good and keeps my hair so smooth shiny and healthy looking!
5208,1,"Smells really good!_This body wash smells amazing. After I shower you can smell it in the air with the mist, so it definitely makes you smell good, unlike some other body washes that leave nothing. I don't have dry skin, so this product is good for me. However, if you do have dry skin, then this might not be what you're looking for. But Olay's triple moisture body wash (I think that's what its called) is amazing for moisturizing, and still smells great (I wrote a review on it as well). That one makes your skin like silk practically."

I like the dark rather than the clear as the dark fills in any little spaces between your own or the false lashes."
1042,1,"consistent results, great maintainence cream._YES.  I am 26, with dry, sensitive skin.  Taking birth control for more than 5 years has left me with hyper-pigmentation and uneven skin tone.  I purchased this cream after recently quitting smoking as part of my 'taking care of myself' routine... and I couldn't be happier.  I use this stuff AM & PM, and have found it to be extraordinarily well-tolerated.  I used to exfoliate my face with St. Ives (I know.) every morning.  If I didn't, I would end up with nasty flakes, no matter how much moisturizer I used.  My skin would feel like an oil slick, but still dry underneath, and this would lead to breakouts.  I have been using this cream as an exfoliant in conjunction with filtered jojoba oil, and the results have been just really delightful.  Even, bright skin tone (noticeable results after a week, although skin feels better after the first use), minimized pores, and an all-over glow that is SO EXCITING!  Don't be afraid of the tingle/itchiness for the first few days; it subsided after a half hour or so and did NOT lead to breakouts.I bought mine at Ulta for around $15.00.I really recommend this cream, and am planning on purchasing another jar.EDIT (still using 3 months later):I wish this came in a pump container.  ONLY complaint.This is a fantastic, affordable alpha hydroxy cream.  It has a reasonable percentage of glycolic acid to use as a nightly exfoliating product.  It's gentle, doesn't break me out, and provides consistent improvement.If you want something heavier, I would recommend Skin Laboratory's 35% glycolic peel.  This Alpha Hydrox cream will NOT give you the dramatic results a peel with a higher percentage will.  It WILL, however, maintain the results from said peels and will refine your skin.  I really recommend this cream as an alternative to manual exfoliation.  It also works as a spot treatment.Lastly, make sure you use sunblock religiously, as with any alpha hydroxy.  This is really important.  Not only will your hard work be canceled out, you will see OPPOSITE results (i.e. dark spots will become darker, etc.).  This is why I recommend using this cream at night.A++ HG material."
2784,1,Wonderful_I use this and have found it has given me great results with the other L'Oreal products that I use for my skin care.
6814,1,"Very nice_This is very pretty. It feels great on the lips, like a chapstick or lip balm. You have to build the color to get a decent pigmentation (which I like but some may not). I purchased Berry Smoothie and Peach Parfait.The Berry Smoothie is like a sheer fushia with a bitt more pink. The Peach Parfait is like a..... I can't really explain it but its pretty.They have a bit of shimmer in them but not enough to look cheap or feel gritty. Its like a grown up lip gloss, it has a bit of shine/gloss and more color than a lip gloss but not as much as a lipstick. I would definitely buy these again.I will add that I liked the colors on me and I am a lighter-skinned black woman, just in case you are wondering how this will go with your skin tone."
8182,0,"Not a good experience_My experience with this cream, sadly, was not a positive one.  I can't speak to rather or not it actually reduces cellulite over time because I could never use it more than once.  First of all, the bottle insinuates it has a raspberry scent but in truth it smells terrible.  I can't stress that enough. It has this awful chemical smell.  Second, it doesn't want to absorb into your skin for anything.  The directions tell you to vigorously rub it in and they're not lying.  I had to press and scrub my hand over and over my skin before it would even begin to rub in.  Third (and perhaps this is the cause of my fourth problem, I'm not sure) I am terribly intolerant to caffeine.  My body just cannot handle it and I've been known to get sick from drinking decaffeinated coffee because of the trace amounts of caffeine that still remain.  I wasn't aware until I already applied the cream that caffeine is one of its leading ingredients so if this is an issue for anyone please be aware of this.  Fourth, within thirty seconds of rubbing it into my legs, my skin began to burn and itch.  After less than a minute I ended up needing to go wash it all off my legs and even then they continued to itch and burn for 5-10 minutes afterwards.  So I can't vouch for rather or not it actually will reduce the appearance of cellulite, but from my experience I can't recommend anyone trying."
4818,1,"Glossy but runny!_This is a great top coat creating a really glossy shine BUT it is a little runny. Try to put it on really thin and stay just off the edges....don't try to go all the way into the sides. By the time you get to the light to set it, it'll spread to where it needs to be on the edges. If you spread it too perfectly, by the time the light sets it, it'll have pooled on the side of your nails creating ridges."
2677,0,Completely ineffective._I tried this for a mild yeast infection and it did absolutely nothing after taking three a day for close to a week.  I knew it sounded too good to be true and I was right!  I should have figured that a homeopathic treatment in a non-specific probiotic base would be useless.  I'm just wondering how other people saw any improvement with this sham product.  I'll stick to my refrigerated probiotics and more verifiable herbal treatments for yeast infection relief in the future.
8095,0,"Smells Terrible_I suppose on the merits of the fact that this sunscreen works, I should give it more stars. I simply cannot. The smell of this sunscreen left much to be desired though.The sunscreen did not leave me with any sunburn. Given my fair complexion I was impressed. The smell almost caused me to wish to take the risk though.This sunscreen is fairly cheap, but I can't really think of a good reason why someone should have to settle for something as flawed as this product. Most sunscreens don't come with putrid smells. Go buy one of those and don't waste your time being nauseated by this product."
5971,1,"Nice for the price_This hair dryer is pretty good for the price.  It has alot of options as far as speed and heat, plus has the turbo option and a cool shot.  It doesn't dry my hair faster unless I use the turbo option, even then it's not a big difference.  I still like the hair dryer though, it's easy to handle and does it's job."
2067,1,Husband's favorite for soothing rough hands_My husband loves the non-greasy formula of this product.  And the price with Amazon was better than in the store.
9556,1,Axe Face Wash_I have a few face washes from axe and they all preform well for the asking price.  This product is no different.  You can use this as an everyday face wash as it's a smooth/gentle formula without any 'micro-beads' that other washes have for a deeper clean.  The scent is pleasant and fades quickly after you're done washing.  My face was left feeling smooth and clean.  Definitely recommended.
154,1,"Exactly the right size_This is a &#34;travel&#34; version but it's the only one I use at home - five jumbo curlers are exactly what you want for some wave, body, and curl but NOT Shirley Temple-style ringlets.  They used to come with metal hooks, but now they come with white plastic jaw clips which are much easier to use."
7209,1,"Slows down hair loss_Bought this from groupon for 19 bucks. After 2 washes I already noticed the decrease in hair loss. After 2 weeks of use (I wash my hair about 4 times a week), hair loss has slowed down significantly. I used to see hair everywhere in my bathroom floor and it was horrifying to see how much hair I lost each day(my hair loss might be due to stress and lack of nutrition and sleep). After using this product for a few month the hair loss has reduced about 70%. I can't say this product helps to promote hair growth, but it does work to prevent hair loss.This shampoo has a gel texture. It cleans very well, sort of like a clarifying shampoo. It's perfect for peole who have oily scalp like myself. It maybe a little drying to people who have dry scalp and hair, but you can still use it regularly as long as you condition your hair well after washing ---to me a $5 panteen hair mask does the trick.By the way, although this shampoo is pricy, it lasts a long time because a little goes a long way. I have long hair and I usually shampoo my hair twice before applying conditioner. A bottle will last me at least 4 months."
9568,1,"pleasant scent but I like Apollo and Deep Space better_I&#8217;m not picky when it comes to body wash. I just don&#8217;t want it to dry out my skin and I want it to smell good or not have a scent at all. It should also be fairly inexpensive. Axe isn&#8217;t particularly moisturizing but it lathers up nicely and it&#8217;s inexpensive. Axe Harmony is described as a calming shower gel and it does have a relaxing scent to it (if that makes any sense). I smell clove and mint but I&#8217;m no expert on scents. All I know is that it smells good and my wife agrees. She thinks it has somewhat of a soapy, zesty smell. I have also used Axe Apollo and Deep Space and I have to say I like the smell of those better so I probably wouldn&#8217;t get Harmony again."
2004,1,"Silky smooth_These make-up remover wipes are perfect.  They remove every trace of makeup from your skin and leave your skin silky soft and comfortable!  I can't recommend them enough.  Of course, they are gentle and good for your skin, they are from Neutrogena.  Great product!!"
7359,1,"Great Soap for Sensitive Skin!_I love the clean smell of this soap. It's works great on sensitive skin and won't dry you out like some other bar soaps do. The price is good too. The best inexpensive soap out there in fact! Also, if you drop it in the shower it floats!"
3906,1,"Helpful product_I've been using the NutraSonic for about a month, and I like it.  I debated buying this, because I have some manual pads for years that I never used, but kept meaning to.  Buying this was enough of a incentive to actually use it daily.  I have combination skin.  While the oiliness has not been reduced, the dry flakes are now minimal.  I had hoped the NutraSonic would have reduced my pore size more than it has, but there has been some improvement.  Maybe with continued use there will be more.My face cream seems to absorb better now."
6056,1,works_Works really well on my long hair.  Keeps the extreme ends from splitting and being fly away.  I would recommend.
9072,1,"Light and practical_Cassani was our first fogless shower mirror we've tried, and we are beyond thrilled. It is very light, easy to attach on the wall, has a nice razor wall mount, and is very affordable. Although my husband is shaving in the shower for a long time, never used a mirror, but did quite a good job shaving. Now, with the awesome dimensions of this mirror he is able to see every inch of his face and neck no matter how steamy the shower gets! I definitely recommend it."
5196,1,Starry Long Lasting Waterproof eyeliner-gel_I have tried through the years high-end department store brands and drug store brands and never really liked any of the eyeliners. Saw this and thought why not one more. Best eyeliner that I have ever used. Easy to apply even with a not so steady hand. You can use it a little or apply more. I bought black. Highly recommend!
406,1,"Pleasantly surprised._I am down to the last few drops of my camomile gentle eye make-up remover by the body shop. the nearest body shop store is about 45 mins away from me and I can't drive there within the next 2 weeks so I purchased a cheap ( compared to the one from body shop) makeup remover from my supermarket to hold me over until I make it to the body shop.For giggles sake I applied my camomile eye makeup remover to one cotton round and this neutrogena oil- free eye makeup remover( after shaking it) to another cotton round.I placed both cotton rounds over my eyes to remove my eyeshadow, liquid eyeliner and mascara.I held each pad on eyelids for about 6 seconds so that each product can soak into the makeup. After 5-6 seconds, I wiped and looked at the difference. Neutrogena removed 98% while my wonderful camomile only removed about 85%. I turned the cotton round over and with the second wipe, neutrogena removed the remaining 2%, no traces of mascara left!!! The body shop camomile removed about 93% so I had to wipe a couple more times ( but this was my normal routine using it anyway).In the end after that camomile soaked round was used up, I still had a small bit of mascara residue on lashes so I used the neutrogena cotton round to remove it.I just permanently replaced my body shop camomile eye makeup remover with this neutrogena one. I love the moisturizing effect too, my skin is normal type."
6251,0,"Gold is horrible as a shatter_I own almost all the shatter colors and gold, silver and white all make horrible shatters. They only look decent with certain colors, which is not many colors. Stick to black or blue or purple"
9205,1,Five Stars_i cant wait to use all of these colors
3523,1,"Great brush for blending!_I know a lot of people have a negative opinion on this brush, but I love it! Maybe I just got a good one&#8230;..It's perfect for blending, I haven't had any issues with it. The bristles are really soft and it works well for me, plus I think I got it for like $2.00. Short and sweet, I don't have anything negative to say about it."
9974,1,"I Love How Dead Sea Salt Products Work On My Skin Type_Like I said before, Adovia has wonderful products. I like them all. This is just another one that I was happy with. I love products with Dead Sea Salt in them because they work very well on my skin. This particular product is very gentle on my skin and I can use it under my makeup or at night before I go to bed.  I'm happy that it has Vitamin C in it because I love the way that Vitamin C makes my skin feel and look too.The consistency is light and like the company's description states, it really is non oily. I don't like to use anything too heavy or oily on my skin, because then I'll usually end up breaking out. It also definitely moisturizes my skin a lot. My skin feels nice-it's soft, firmer, and smooth. My husband and I have noticed that my complexion looks more clear and over all better. It must be the sea salt and Vitamin C doing their jobs!The bottle has a silver pump top, which I've said in other reviews, these pump tops make it easy to dispense a small amount at a time. You really only need a couple of pumps (at least that's all I use).Happy as usual with another Adovia product. I can't wait to try out something new by them as soon as possible.Recommend? Yes!I received a free bottle in exchange for my honest review. All opinions expressed are 100% my own, and in no way influenced."
6579,1,"Colorful_I really love this nail polish set, I like to paint my nails a solid color and then use the glitter nail polish to put on the tips of my nails. I personally love the bright colors :)"
2521,1,"Good, sturdy tool._Like others, I do my own gel manicures at home.  I've never been good about pushing my cuticles back, etc, but with gel you MUST or it starts to lift right away.  So I got this to help me have nice looking manicures.  It works quite well.  I use it in conjunction with cuticle remover, and it does a pretty good job. I do think it was designed for toenails, but it works for fingernails just as well."
230,1,Great Comb!_This comb works great on my hair. I use it while I have conditioner on my hair to remove tangles.

9222,1,"Thank god this liquid gold isn't priced as such!_It has so many uses and really does work wonders, the omegas and antioxidants seem to be thereason why. I have found that there isn't a body part head to toe that can't benefit from it'suse (I really do use it on my toes as pedi oil and it works better than any pedicure oil I'vetried). One of the best uses I've found is to prevent razon burn in extremely sensitive areas,I think it is also helping prevent any ingrown hairs along with it. This one is legit fromwhat I can tell it hasn't been diluted it has that arganny smell to it (bittersweet and nutty),the color is right and it isn't toooily either, and it absorbs into the skin just like it is supposed to."
550,1,"Smooth shiney full hair_I swim in a heavily chlorinated pool every other day. My hair was getting more and more dry. In addition, my scalp was itching. I had tried four different shampoos before trying this one in desperation, thinking that I was possibly allergic to some chemical in the regular shampoos.This not only relieved my itchy scalp, it gave me a totally gorgeous head of hair. My hair is smooth without being dry, frizzy, or oily, but perfectly balanced. I tend to get frizzy hair but this smoothed as well or better even than my previous favorite which was Frizz-Ease.This does lather, in spite of being sulfate free, and has that herbal/medicinal scent which I find pleasant. It is dark brown and rather thick. The suds take a while to develop, and are small dense suds, so you just slosh this through your hair at first, then it later lathers.I can't get over how soft and smooth and happy my hair and scalp are. I love Aubrey Organics for their skin moisturizers and now I'm sold on this shampoo. They make so many types of shampoo I didn't know which to get but this one seems to be perfect.For reference, my hair is fine but thick, tends to frizz in humidity, is wavy, and has been getting oily frequently lately, probably in response to getting dried out and beat by the pool water."
9861,1,Has a really nice smell._I really like this product.  I have seen results from the very first use. It has really help with the puffiness and fine lines under my eyes.  I also like that is has a great smell and it is 100% pure.  I highly recommend this product.
1953,1,Wow. The most POWERFUL face mask I have ever worn._First off I was desperate for an acne medication. I searched acne on amazon and this came out first. I searched it up and bought it at Vitamin Store for 6.49$. It works SO well!!! It really does pulse! the formula I do: 1 tablespoon clay mix 1 tablespoon RAW Apple cider vinegar. This will make more than enough clay mixture for your face. I will do an update on this in about a week.
1503,0,"I didn't buy this product from Amazon, but the CD sight directly......._It makes your hair smell good. That is the only benefit that I can see that came from it. I did not purchase it again. As a MOF, I still have half a bottle left. Thanks, but no thanks for making my hair smell good. I'd rather have healthy hair that is not hard, than hair that smells good. No, this didn't add any moisture to my hair I don't think."
3386,1,Perfect timing!_Having a halloween party tomorrow and I needed some quality eyeshadow at a low price. I'm not a crazy make up girl but I do wear it occasions inlay. And tomorrow I defiantly need it for my super cool costume. And it came just in time too. I received it today!! Can't wait to try them out. They are extremely vivid and have great colors. None were broken.

3895,1,"Great lipstick_My first Vasani and I'm not disappointed! the color is true magenta-wine, like the texture and leaves  a nice stain.Love this!"
2387,1,"great results_I've been using this product once a week for about the past 6 weeks.  I use it on my face, lower arms and decolletage.  It smooths rough skin and leaves it glowing.  I am really happy with the results.  You only need a tiny bit (1/8 of a tsp mixed with either water or cleanser).  This should last quite a long time and since it's in crystal form you don't have to worry about an expiration date. Good product to use before self tanning lotion as well.Update 2/4/14:  I've been using this product for a little over 6 months now (2-3) times a week. I've noticed lately that my age spots are fading.  I think it has to be as a result of this product as I haven't changed anything else in my beauty routine.  These crystals are a great find!"
125,1,"Love_I've recently switched SPF moisturizers and am so very pleasantly pleased with this purchase.  It fits all my requirements, does the job quite well, and is within budget."
714,1,"Good, affordable product, no miracles..._I'm in my late 30's and normally have dark eye circles if I don't get enough sleep or stressed out.I don't believe any products can create miracles, that's why I didn't fall for expensive brand name eye treatment. After doing some research on the internet, hyaluronic acid and ceramides, retinol, neuropeptides, vitamin C and E, etc were found to be important ingredient for anti-aging eye cream. However, debates over whether these are real effects or just placebo are still very hot..I bought this product to give it a try mainly because of affordability. After using it for about a week, my office mate did notice my dark circles faded a little, but I also had some good night sleep as well. I would rather believe it is a combination effect.I didn't have any bad reactions to the cream, but I only use it at bed time since it is known that retinol will increase skin sensitivity with sunlight.After all, I think this eye cream will help, but nothing dramatic; healthy life style, diet and plenty of rest are more important. In the long run, I think it should be beneficial comparing to using nothing at all. If you want instant results, I recommend surgery."
541,1,"Perfect product for the switch from conventional to healthy_I recently attended a health seminar that made me realize that every thing you put on your body ends up inside your body - it enters your bloodstream through your skin and eventually circulates to all your internal organs.  So basically, if you wouldn't eat it, you shouldn't put it on your skin.  So I decided to throw away all my chemical-ridden drugstore beauty products and start buying all organic.  Soap and lotion are easy, but I was unsure how the shampoo would go.  As mucb as I want to be natural, my hair is very long and needs to look good.  I am happy to report that this shampoo did not dissapoint.  It leaves my hair as shiny, bouncy and healthy looking as my Pantene used to.  My only negative feedback is that the smell is very strong - it's floral but kind of in an unappealing way.  I don't really care for it.  It's almost like roses mixed with sulfur or something. But luckily, you only smell it while shampooing and once your hair dries the smell is pretty much gone.  I am going to experiment with some other shampoos in the Aubrey line to see if any have a better fragrance.  The Chamomile volumizing shampoo (not the blue chamomile) is next on my list.  Chamomile sounds much more mild smelling than rose, so we'll see how that goes.  In the meantime I am still using the Rose - the smell is not enough of a deterrent to make me stop using it."
80,1,No palm oil in this soap._I switched to this soap after finding out the 'cruely-free' ones I had been using contained palm oil 'hidden' in the ingredient lists under different names. Palm oil production is driving orangutans to near extinction. Not exactly 'cruelty-free' as those soaps claimed. This brand is great for sensitive skin.

4779,1,"i really like it_I have only dried my hair twice with it, because I bought it 2 nights ago. I do like it, it feels quality to me. My hair is a lot less frizzy even After letting it dry half way then finishing with the dryer. I actually have very curly hair that is banana curls underneath and waves everywhere else. I did half my hair with the diffuser for the curls andhalf my head straight(no I didn't go out in public like this) and I like it for styling both ways. It's heavier then my red Revlon dryer and blue contair but it does a better job. I hated my blue dryer b/c I always had frizzy hair afterwards. The red dryer was like a someone blowing on my hair themselves no power at all. So far so good, I purchased mine at target, they have the dryers they sell on display so you can pick them up and feel the weight and shape I would suggest finding a local target that offers that before buying a new dryer. Make sure it's right weight for yourself, I was ok with it and I have corporal tunnel ion both my arms."
9119,1,"Love the Vinylux line and this is a great basic color_I am simply smitten with my recent (how did I just learn of this:!:!) discovery of Vinylux. I was once a fake nail girl. Expensive, time-consuming, toxic and destructive. After a few years without, I swapped to shellac. I love it at first, but discovered it too hurt the nail, was somewhat time consuming, and I worried about the effect of the light on my skin and nail beds. THIS stuff is the bomb. I dries super fast, no light required, and does last amazingly well. My nails peel and chip within a day with regular polish. This stuff is the bomb. So happy. I haven't kept it on a week yet. It's so quick and easy to change colors (no soaking, just regular polish remover). Love it!"

8100,1,"Banana Boat Nails It With This One!_I wear sunscreen every single day.  Even on the cloudiest, dreariest, cold Ohio day, any exposed skin gets sun protection.  Even if I'm going to stay inside all day, I wear sunscreen.  The sunlight, however diminished, is still there.  I have a enough sun damage already from my younger days when UVA/UVB sunscreens weren't available.I useCeraVe Moisturizing Facial Lotion AMon my face, but I have a devilish time trying to find a fragrance-free body sunscreen that contains skin-friendly ingredients beyond the sunscreen actives.  I wind up using body moisturizer and apply sunscreen on top of it.Which brings me to the price of this sunscreen.  It seems a bit high for this brand, but I don't have to use two products.  This isn't loaded with fantastic skin-care ingredients, but enough that it will do.  It feels more like a moisturizer than a sunscreen when you apply it.  In short, I love, love, love it!The only gripe I have is the green color.  The product is like a green and white swirly.  I could live without the color, but I'm not going to ding it for that.  It's the last ingredient, and does not show on my skin; nor does it irritate my skin.  The plus side to it is the kids will like it."
3685,0,"Not for Me..._I purchased this product from my doctor. The office price was more than Amazon, of course. My doctor told me this was the best so I faithfully used it for maybe a year. I noticed not even the slightest improvement. I wanted to like it because I paid so much for the Lumere(I like the name) and the packaging is nice. Well, this product simply did not work for me."
5476,1,"Keith Urban Fantastic_This stuff is amazing!!! I got a tiny bottle of the oil as a gift, and likes how it worked and smells yummy!!! So tried this leave in and I think it is the better of all the oils you could moisturize your hair with. It certainly does not dry it out like one of the other top oils does to me, and a few other people who have said they had that in common as well......so this is 5 stars in my book."
7035,0,"Not so much..._I am a Neutrogena girl. I feel like there isn't anything they make that's not great. However, this product I was not impressed with. I was testing this brand against &#34;Clean & Clear&#34; and I have to say, I like the &#34;Clean & Clear&#34; version better. When I applied a sheet to my face, it stuck to my face and lifted my freshly applied make-up right off, I could see it on the sheet. Give them a try for yourself maybe, they'll work better for you, but I'll stick with Clean & Clear for now."
8338,1,"The Shield scent is really nice for sensitive skin_My husband has sensitive skin that reacts easily to harsh ingredients, but the Shield scent, which is designed for this skin type, has been great for him!  It doesn't burn or cause redness, and it doesn't leave his skin too tight-feeling or stripped after he uses it.  The scent is also a little more mild than some other AXE scents he's had, and it dissipates pretty quickly, so it doesn't linger too long."

885,1,"best bronzer I've ever used_This is honestly the best bronzer I've ever used. It's not orange at all, it's a very natural color. I'm fair skinned, and while I've found that a little goes a long way for me with highlighting my cheekbones, it can easily be layered for a darker effect.  The packaging looks nothing like what is pictured (mine is black with the words 'Fake Bake' on it), but it's a decent sized compact with a mirror large enough to use for travel"
7137,1,Good product for curly hair._This is one of the best shampoo products I have used on my curly hair.  My scalp feels quite clean and my hair does not feel stripped after.  I have tried many less foaming shampoos and have been underwhelmed with the results.  This product is actually much better than expected.
5938,1,"Reduces Wrinkles & Improves Skin Texture!_This is a TREATMENT not a daily cleansing system so this product can not accurately be compared to the Clarisonic/Olay/Dove cleansing systems. This machine VIBRATES because the puffs contain crystals that can be too harsh if used with a circulating machine! The puffs contain the same microdermabrasion crystals that are used by professionals. Amazon has the best price if you are able to take advantage of their free shipping offer.I love this microdermabrasion treatment. It sloughs off dead skin and my complexion looks so much healthier. The texture of my skin is smoother & so very soft! I use this system twice weekly but Neutrogena recommends using it up to 3x weekly MAX! I apply a hot wash cloth to my face prior to treatment to open pores. I run the puff (already applied to machine) under hot tap water before and during use so that the machine glides smoothly over my skin throughout the entire process. If you use this on a WET face there may be enough moisture in the puff. Be sure to use the FULL specified time on EACH area WITHOUT APPLYING PRESSURE! My first treatment was the most dramatic because my wrinkles were less noticeable after all of the dead skin was buffed away. I apply 100% Aloe after each treatment. I have light acne breakouts which improved but I still have to use my store brand Sulfur Mask as an overnight spot treatment on occasion so this treatment is not an 'acne miracle' for HORMONAL breakouts but with continued use it will keep pores unclogged and improve the appearance of acne scars. This is something that I will use LONG TERM not just once or twice so keep this in mind & be patient.I recommend watching the 'NEUTROGENA' Microdermabrasion System tutorial on their website. It's also on You Tube. I found other You Tube reviews helpful but be careful when following the advice of others because some of them did not follow directions and ended up with red, inflamed skin after pressing down too hard. You should not be in pain after using this product so if you are, back off on the amount of pressure you apply during treatment. This machine is very easy to use and the instructions are simple. You should NOT have a problem with the puff staying on the machine so if you do exchange the product for another one or contact the manufacturer."
7697,1,"wow_I really like using this with the Dr. Dennis Gross extra strength alpha beta peel.  Within days of starting the combo, I could see a difference and so could others.  In fact, I recently stopped it for about 2 months and the change in my appearance was noticeable.  Glad to be using it again!"
9652,1,"AMAZING !!_I've received my brushes and I'm very blessed with them , they are very soft and the quality is amazing just like Sigma or MAC ... I'm sure I'll repurchase again these set :) THANK YOU !"
2517,1,"Awesome Little Tool_I don't get a ton of blemishes, but when I do I can't resist the urge to pop the little buggers. My girlfriend pointed out one of these types of tools in CVS one day, but being the Amazon-addict that I am, I waited until I got home to order one online.This is a very well constructed piece of 'equipment' and serves its purpose admirably. It does an EXCELLENT job of extracting white heads and black heads. One end is used for white heads and really gets all the gunk out, the other is used for black heads/clogged pours. This requires a bit more work, but still does a great job. Best of all, it doesn't leave my skin agitated and puffy like my fingernails do.If you get the occasional blemish, get one of these. They are cheap, easy to use, and effective.Recommended: Absolutely!"
9863,1,"soft skin right away_I just received this serum and I like it very much. It goes on smoothly, no stinging, and leaves my skin soft right away. Quite remarkably, it smooths my skin out as soon as I put it on. that sounds unlikely, but I notice a difference immediately and keep checking the mirror.. My face cream and make up goes on smoothly and no flaking as with some serums. I am looking forward to seeing my brown spots and wrinkles lesson because of the quality ingredients and processing.  Building Collagen is key in reducing wrinkles and flaws while improving skin texture. I like this product a lot. Good customer service and fast shipping. The company stands behind the product with a full year guaranty so there is no risk to try. look for my update."
3521,1,"Good Quality Eyelash Curler_This is a good quality eyelash curler!  Unlike so many of the cheaply-made models on the market, this one feels sturdy and curls lashes without squeezing it so hard.  It even comes with a replacement rubber part.  This is so worth what I paid for it.  I can confidently recommend this to others."
4135,0,DO NOT BUY_i cant stand sally hansen pens. they are watery and only last for like one or two use. it is so very annoying it is not a good buy at all.
6224,0,Not happy with this lipstick_It looks chalky and came damaged. Horrible packing unless mine was previously opened. Perhaps I will use it mixing it with another more moisturizing balm because this lipstick seems dry. I will not be buying any more of this brand. It was cheap and I guess I shouldn't expect much from it to begin with... My bad.
5286,1,32 color eyeshadow kit_I have this already and I like it very pretty color's I do not want to be chared two times any more
5244,1,Lengthens lashes like no other!_This mascara lengthens lashes like you cant even imagine!  I've been using it for years and often get asked by other women what I am wearing.The only problem is that it does flake after wearing it for extended periods of time and can be difficult to remove with soap and water.
3282,1,Unscented & gentler than medicated pads_I think this face wash is gentler on my skin than those medicated face pads.  And I really like that there's no real scent to it.  I wouldn't want something overly fragrant; I have sensitive skin and can be effected by that.  It does a good job of cleaning my pores and makes my face feel fresh and clean.  I like it and would get it again.
4322,1,"One of the best!_This is my favorite drug store mascara. It is only one of the few that actually lengthens and volumizes my eyelashes. Because I'm Asian, my eyelashes are short and barely visible but this mascara brings out my eyelashes. However, I only use this as a base and use about 2 or 3 other mascaras to give my eyelashes the full volumized effect. This mascara alone does a pretty good job, but using other masacaras combined can give me the look I want"
5089,1,Recommended._This was recommended by a hair dresser. Cheaper on Amazon than the salon. A tiny amount of the shampoo is needed to create thick lather. My hair feels amazing.
4859,1,pretty color_it could pass for black but it has a slight purple/deep red hue to it. Very pretty color and this brand is great quality
1299,1,"Great Mask_I really like these - I get gobs of light in my room despite the heavy curtains, these block it out. They're also really soft and plush. Here's why they lose a star: The front material picks up lint like CRAZY, and I suspect that the dye they use in these has been leaving purplish streaks on my skin and pillowcases. But you know, they let me sleep!"
1856,1,"flawless lashes...._The seller was prompt price was good, now this product does give you volume and lashes are long now the only thing about this product it dries quick, now me my self i use 3 different mascara because i love thick long lashes now i safe this product for last because it dries quick!  I  like it so i still gave it a 4 star because even though it dries  fast my lashes are flawless and i will reorder this product again....hope this helps you"
973,1,I Want More! Get This Product._This stuff makes my face feel so silky and soft. I'm already out. I need to buy more. I ordered it to prep my face for my wedding and it was great!
4814,1,Wonderful as is or with French Manicure_This is a great color to use as a natural color for the French Manicure or if you are looking for a more neutral color to wear. I mean lets face it we can't always wear bright blue color everyday. Especially useful if your growing out your nails because it makes them so much stronger.
7938,1,"Good Stuff_I just received this set and it is true to the description.  I haven't used it yet, the dotting tools are sturdy and are all different sizes, the brushes look amazing, you get a black case and a gift, i got a beautiful pink file.  I received this product in three day after purchase, super fast and it was pack very well.  Love this seller they are fast and sell good quality and good pricing, my second purchase with them and i will continue to purchase from them."
4372,1,Simply the best!_This product does exctly what it says . You must use a generous amount so I strongly suggest no trying to save some. I use this bottle in 2.5 uses meaning i get 2 uses out of each bottle basically but its does its job so its wortth it.  So its needs to stay affordable because we have to use so much to make sure this protection serum doesnt break down while wearing your various styles.
8889,1,Way better than bobby pins_I have long thick hair and it would take 8-10 bobby pins to achieve a reasonable hold.  Then the pins would damage my hair as I was taking them out.  One of these little guys does a great job with holding my hair and 2 is better than a dozen pins.  The blonde pins blend nicely with my hair.  Great product.
3721,0,"Not for my hair_I have extremely fine, naturally curly hair that I pull straight most days. Since it frizzes at just the mention of the word 'humidity,' I need thick, heavy duty conditioners to help keep it under control. This conditioner is thin and runny, more a simple de-tangler than a true conditioner. For me it's unusable. Smells good, though!"
7645,1,Great for crafting_I used this for a phone case I wanted to decorate. They were very cute and just like the picture I plan to use the on other thingsproslight weighcute
271,1,Love it!_OPI is always my favorite...and now so is this color. It's a dull (not shiny) color...but that is just what I was looking for.
3052,1,"The Remington Shine outshines the competition!_Having four women (a wife and three daughters) in the house, we also own several own curling/straightening irons.  We own a couple of low end Conair products, a more upscale Wahl and this Remington Shine.  I would rate the Shine far above the Conair entry-level products and a step above the Wahl. Wahl had taken the approach of including components which snap onto the heating plates to infuse conditioners into your hair.  Remington has taken this a step further.  Unlike having to replace conditioning plates ever few weeks,  the Shine's permanent plates are infused with Vitamin E and Avocado oil.  When heating, these conditioners transfer from the plate surface to your hair.  The advertised life of the plates is 4 years, which also matches the product warranty.  Naturally, personal use (how often you use it, how hot a temperature you set, and so on) will affect how long the plates remain infused.  There's no reason to assume that even after the plates are no longer infused,  you couldn't continue to use the straightener.Performance-wise, the Shine is great.  It heats very quickly, leaves hair straight and nicely conditioned, and there is no odor noticeable from the heated plates.  I found that the Wahl tended to over-condition hair a little, but the Remington Shine leaves hair just right.  I'm using the product on long hair, one natural brunette, two natural blondes, and one bottled blonde.  They all love the Shine.What's in the box?  Shine S9950 Straightener  Instruction GuidePROs:  Very fast heat up, getting to 390 degrees in about 40 seconds.  Good temperature range,  300-430 degrees.  Bright LCD display.  Swivel  cord,  over  5 feet in length.  Shuts off automatically in 60 minutes.  Hinge lock to keep straightener almost completely closed (keepslittle or big hands from getting  badly burned).I didn't find the product to have any `cons'.  This is a really good straightener, and your hair looks nice and straight and perfectly conditioned after use.  Even though there are higher priced straighteners out there,  I would consider this a professional grade product and it is very reasonable priced."
772,1,"Deep Moisture Body Wash_This body wash is very good for dry skin.Does what it says, with deep moisturizing.Very little foaming or suds, but great for shaving legs etc.Rinses off easily but I'm not impressed with the scent.The scent is very weak and mild, but smells almost like baby powder.Good product for dry skin but I'd prefer a better smelling body wash."
8640,1,Excellent_It is behaves exactly like the original formula and the package is very easy to open and easy to seal again. the wipes feel smooth and cool on your skin. This is a very nice solution to those annoying zits. It does not work perfectly but comes very close.
8391,0,"Ehhh.._I wasnt really happy about this product because it was too small to hold on to the eyelash.. It was a little hard to get the eyelash with it too. It cheap with is good, so im not too mad about this product."
7417,1,Great buy_I recieved my dotting pens today! Right on time. I love the quality of the pens nice and sturdy. Im going to have fun learning how to use them there pretty!
8597,1,wonderful on dry skin_My husband has very dry skin and this product is great. It makes his skin so soft and takes away the ashy dryness.
5713,1,Another winner from CND Shellac_I chose this and Tropix as my summer pedicure colors and could not be more pleased.  I love the Shellac process and do it myself.  This is really a bold bright summertime pink!
2479,1,Great !_For Audrey is the perfect tiffany-ish blue matte color. I have put CND super shiny over it and just worn it with out a shiny top coat and it looks great either way! It's a gorgeous year around color and a great addition to any nail polish collection.
8890,1,"Great for my thick, high maintainance hair_This is the best &#34;conditioner&#34; type hair product I have ever used.It is very thick and rich and smells very fresh and clean.The product is thicker and more moisturizing than the regular Wen.  They are incredible for my hair when used together.  Thank you very much for a great shipping and shopping experience"
8654,1,"Gorgeous_Fantastic color. I keep looking down at my nails and marveling at them because they look so awesome. I had some issues with it smudging the hour after I put it on when I thought it was dry, but everything's blue and glossy and shimmery and awesome now. :)It took three coats on most fingers to make it opaque, and four on some that needed extra.This polish also looks extra fancy under street lighting at night."
563,1,Great for weak nails_Sticky base + shiny top coat = the best manicure you can give yourself at home. Works great with my Julep colors. It also provides a thick protectant coat for my weak nails.
8590,1,"A Good Idea to ease Shaving._These disposable razors come with a tiny strip of hydrating material on each side of the razor. This helps to moisturize skin as you shave. It works, and I recommend this product. The strips are a bit narrow, thus the 4 star rating."
9272,1,"Fekkai Prx shampoo is a delight for the senses starting with the delicious vanilla scent_Fekkai Prx shampoo is a delight for the senses starting with the delicious vanilla scent.  This delightful shampoo lathers up into a soft, creamy lather that pampers the hair and scalp.  It left my hair soft and moisturized.  My chronically dry scalp felt nourished.  I didn't notice any exceptional shine (but I went on to use the Prx oil which left my hair with an exceptional sheen).  Unfortunately the lovely vanilla scent did not linger."
8076,1,Noticed a difference_After reading other reviews about this product gave it a shot.  Good delivery and good price.  I use twice a day along with Elf primer and only after a couple of weeks my skin looks cleared more refreshed.  My fine lines especially around my eyes are not as noticable.  I am 48 do not have deep wrinkles but I feel this product definately makes a difference.
2567,1,Very good_Love these. makes lines easier to make. It works for my needs.They also seem to be able to last a long time.  I have no complaints about these brushes.
9250,1,Great stuff!_Definitely love this stuff!  A must buy!
658,1,"So So_Had to &#34;air it out&#34; for like a month, because the fabric smelled like burnt hair. Still kinda does... : (  Good product, besides stink, but is too big for my likes. Just too much material. I'll give 4 stars only because I'm sure it works well. Material is def. thick enough and plenty of it."
9581,1,"Wonderful lotion...so silky_I have been using this about 2 weeks it is amazing. A couple days ago my husband mentioned how soft my skin felt, I realized it had that newly shaved silky smooth feeling and well I was not newly shaved it was this wonderful lotion. Furthermore; I have very dry skin in the winter and this was worked miracles for that as well lastly, the smell is light and pleasant I can't stand overpowering sweet smells I love this lotion. Highly recommended!"
6565,1,"Perfect and Pretty!_What can I say? These are just nail files...NOT. They are very pretty glass nail files, which I had never tried before, and probably would have never considered, if not for all the great reviews from my fellow Amazonians. They feel a little weird to touch, if you are sensitive to that kind of thing, but not much worse than touching a standard emery board...a bit &#34;chalkier&#34; feeling. They work great, are stylish and colorful, and are reasonably priced as well. The only downside I can imagine is that they will break if dropped on a hard surface. Still worth it&#8230;just have to be extra careful. :)"
5800,1,"night cream_only used it for two weeks, but like it very much. Seems to even up my skin during the night and does not give me irritation on my very sensible skin"
5618,0,"HORRID_I got this (someone bought it off my wishlist, and I threw the box away, my MISTAKE!) This thing hasn't turned on since I got it. Not once. I dont even know what the thing sounds like. Now I'm completely pissed, never got to use a supposedly brand new product. And my friend spent 10$ for nothing. DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY."
8772,1,"So Smooth!_Dove has really reinvented itself in the last ten years or so.  They have gone way beyond the basic bar of soap! I have been a big fan of their hair care line for awhile now. The products really are salon quality but probably at least one third the price! This conditioner is no exception! I recently colored my hair so it felt a little too crunchy for my taste. I was very happy  with the outcome after using this conditioner just one time. My hair felt smooth and silky and smelled fantastic! It rinsed clean, leaving no gross residue. And the texture of my hair has only gotten better and better the more I used it. This is a wonderful product at a great price!"
5066,1,"The BEST!_For years my hair has been falling out (various reasons: medication, salty water, straightening / dying, etc.) and I have tried all sorts of remedies (various shampoos from salons, vitamins, oils, etc.) and while some were semi-effective, this is the ONLY product that has stopped my hair from falling (not sure if its because its sulfate-free or some other reason) but since then it has been the only shampoo that I use. It has also restored my hair back to its health that I dont even need to blow dry or treat it (I have soft slightly wavy hair but it can get frizzy, esp in the humid climate in my country). I recommend it with the epic volume conditioner."
4843,1,"Perfect white for gelish french manicure_I have been using gelish for about a year now and I normally just do a color nail polish. I've been wanting to try the french manicure by gelish for some time now and I'm glad I did. This is the perfect white to do this. I read through other reviews to make my decision and I'm glad I took their advice. It does need about 2 coats to become the perfect white. Make sure you apply it in thin layers because it tends to bubble up a bit. I put a foundation gel first, then cure it, then one coat of white, clean it up with brush, cure it, then another coat, clean it up with brush and then cure it again.Then I put Simply Sheer over the top and cure it again. I also use the Top coat by gelish for this."
1510,1,"Great Acne Relief_I have struggled with acne for several years and tried just about everything.  This product gets it under control.  After I use it, any blemishes that I have heal much quicker and leave less scarring.  I haven't noticed a whole lot of difference in my pore size/black heads, but I have been using this peel for several months now and I am excited to move up to the 30%.  As soon as I'm done using it, my skin it much softer and there is usually minimal visible peeling.  Definitely worth a try if you suffer from acne.  I only wish that there were a natural alternative that produced these results."
2613,1,"100% helping my weak nails_I tried few nail strengtheners but this one is the best. I use it for 3 days applying layer by layer and i can see the difference! I found the cure for my weak, peeling and easily breaking nails!"
2089,0,"Works okay but too many harsh ingredients_I returned this after a week.  I didn't care for the smell and upon closer inspection of the label, found there are chemicals that I am trying to avoid.  It probably works just fine but I found other more natural creams that work and don't include the harsh chemicals. Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment is the one I tried after this and I'm still using it."
7948,1,"Love this color!_On me, this is an inky purple, almost black, with a subtle red-orangish flash. It's amazing, and my boyfriend loves it so that's a plus. It's an OPI so the formula is flawless. Love this!"
2715,1,"Actually dries fast!_I'm really impressed that Vaseline came out with a lotion that dries in about 15 seconds. It really works, you rub it in and you can turn doorknobs again almost right away instead of having to remember to leave the bathroom door open so you can get out. Plus it smells pretty good too, and the container is huge--a good value for the money. Definitely recommended."
1412,0,"Dimethicone Face_Well, not super pleased with this one.  Don't know why people raved about it.  It goes on like coating your face with silicone (oh wait -- it's &#34;dimethicone&#34;, which is silicone!), and doesn't really soak in.  I'm just not sure how I feel about coating my face in that stuff.Don't use under makeup, as it just makes it look smeary and oily, yuck.  But would probably be okay for night time use.Definitely protects skin from drying out.  Unscented, yay.Won't be buying again."
8517,1,"An Effective 2-In-1: The Sensitive Formula Works Well With Dry Scalp_Truthfully, I've never really taken the extra step to condition my hair after washing it. Maybe I should have, as I have very fine hair, but I've just not been inspired to make the extra effort as long as I was clean and presentable. I have, however, tried about every two-in-one product on the market. For years, I used Pert Plus. But as I got older, my scalp started getting a little dryer and so I started to get more geared toward dandruff shampoos. Dove Men+Care Fortifying Shampoo + Conditioner Sensitive Scalp 2 in 1 (wow, that's a mouthful of a name) seemed to address both of my concerns as it is formulated to work against a dry scalp.Having tried this product for a while now, I say that it is a decent shampoo. It lathers and rinses well, and has a pleasant (but not overpowering) scent. Its magical formula includes both caffeine and tea extract. I'm not sure what the caffeine does to your hair that makes it an appealing choice, but I know I've used a variety of beauty items that include tea extract. I like the semi-tingly sensation that I get from this shampoo, makes me think something is working. And best of all, I haven't noticed a lot of flakes or anything. Am I so impressed that I would go out of my way to pick up this new Dove? Perhaps not. But I like it and wouldn't hesitate to use it again. KGHarris, 2/13."
8709,1,"Spectacular!_When I read the reviews my first thought was, yeah right!  Especially the one where the lady needed to get to the beauty shop for cut and color and used this instead.  Her lunch friend raved about her hair!I used this for the first time today and at lunch was greated with, 'did you just get your hair done?'  It looks FANTASTIC!  So there you go.  My hair for the first time in years no longer looks like hay, oh joy!  Now I, too, am a convert!  Oh by the way I think it smells terrific.  Similiar to Caress soap."
1576,1,"Nice features-great warranty_I liked the features of this dryer; the retractable cord, the removable filter cover for easy cleaning, the dual controls for heat and speed with the cool shot button for setting curls and waves. I usually air dry my fine wavy hair because a hair dryer just tends to make my hair frizzy. But with this dryer I am able to dry my hair in a few minutes, adding volume with no frizz. I like that it comes with both a diffuser and a concentrator. The 3 year warranty is a plus. Con: It is a full size dryer, heavy at 1 3/4 lbs.with the diffuser."
360,1,"Rosy cheeks, no-effort exfoliation_Doesn't matter how my skin is when I woke up...If it's dry, this is my water (yes, it is actually a quenching feeling).  If it's broken out, this is my quick repair.  If it's cold or warm, it gives me the rosy cheeks I adore (without blush or pinching).  This product works really well for me. I have combination skin with an emphasis on combination.  Some days, super oily and others super dry.  Either way, hope mellows my skin the minute I put it on.  Sometimes later in the day, I seem to have a sheen over my skin if I am having an oily day, but overall I love love love this product.  A coworker gave me the 8oz one time for $40 and it has been a struggle to not buy another jar...I gave in.  The texture, the weight, and the results of this product are amazing.  I can always count on my skin returning to a natural and comfortable state as soon as I put this on.  As an added bonus, it really does exfoliate during the day....without having to do any hard work ;)"
5452,1,"Good product, Faulty pump_This is a great product, I have had it before and love it! Very light weight coverage and the hope moisturizer is fantastic. I love that I get a light foundation, moisturizer and sun screen in one product. The problem with this one is the pump does not work properly and sticks so the product sometimes shoots out. This has not happened with the other ones that I have gotten at  department stores. Maybe just a fluke."
5681,1,"Maybe I should be giving 5 stars_I admit, I don't know how to use hair styling products so for me it's too complicated so I didn't bother reviewing it but when my friend came over and did my hair using this it looked so easy.  Also I have other friends who used it and said they love it."
5553,1,"pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the product_This tool kit is just perfect. The blazer is sharp but will not hurt the delicate eye brow, the scissors is made of very good quality stainless steel, it is very handy, i use it to trim my hair, trim my dog, absolutely love this product&#65281;"
4523,0,"foul smell_The bottle I got was less than 2/3 full.  I wrote to the company and they said that was normal, but it didn't seem right to me and I felt a bit ripped off.  The consistency is nice, and a little drop goes a long way, but to me it smells rancid.  For a high quality oil I thought it would smell more neutral.  I resist putting it on my face at night because I don't want to smell it or have it on my pillowcase."
9466,1,Love this styling whip_I have always been a fan of Fekkai products and this styling whip just reconfirms my opinion.  This mousse gives great body.  I have medium length hair and noticed how much more volume I had at the roots.  This has a wonderful smell and I could really tell the difference between this and another mousse I was using for volume.  This wins hands down.
3164,1,"My favorite_I have used many different lip glosses and lip sticks and this is by far my favorite and not even expensive, great for the money and I highly recommend it."
9512,1,"Holds well, no clog pump, smells light_Although this is marketed as a kids hair spray I use it and I am an adult. It's named swinging' coconut, which I thought it would smell like and that is why I wanted to try it. It actually smells more fruity to me. It's alcohol free and I have no problems with any type of clogging of the pump. It's a very nice soft hold that lasts for 4-5 hours. I have medium thick natural wavy hair that is currently little over shoulder length, I wash it every two to three days as to not dry it out. I can use this spray and brush it out without flaking or stickiness. If I need all day hold I use bed head brand but that has to be washed out. I really like this suave for easy hair days."
2815,1,Works great._My skin gets really dry and itchy.  I love this lotion.  It doesn't have a strong smell and isn't greasy.  I hate greasy lotion.
7564,1,Nice Makeup Brushes_these are nice brushes.. Very soft and at the same time firm enough so as to give good application of makeup..! Worth buying!
5490,0,"So disappointed_I am disappointed because I was really looking forward to having a salon style blowout. I do a better job with my round brush and blow dryer. I also feel like it is damaging the ends of my hair. Bummer, I was hoping it was all the reviews said it would be."
9394,1,Makes my face feel refreshed and toned!_It absorbs into your skin very quickly and feels great on your skin. Since I've been using Natures Best Vitamin C Serum I love the way it makes my skin look more refreshed and toned. My face feels more firmer also. It makes me feel like I'm doing something good for my skin!
8004,1,"Love the colors, love the wear_Beautiful long lasting colors, shades for every style, concealers/ lipsticks/ blushes/ brow shadow/ eyeshadows all in one convenient box  - it's fabulous! Downside? Same as every multi-product compact: your powder debris gets into your creams if you're not careful. I just cut a piece of freezer bag (because it's heavier plastic) in strips the size of my concealers and one for the lipsticks, then pushed it down on them to keep them clean - problem solved!"
6044,1,"Electric Manicure Nail Art File Drill Pen Kit with 6 Bits_Electric Manicure Nail Art File Drill Pen Kit with 6 Bits..I just love this drill, it works as good as the professional ones in the nail salons. Awesome price too...."
6859,1,"Great_Very inexpensive, 5 of them came.  It is so nice to have my nail polishes organized and looking like they would look like on nails, not in the bottles.  Now it is so easy to hold each colour up to my hand when deciding which colour I should paint."
8797,1,good_the only reason I didn't give this a 5 is because I received more gold than silver but overall I love these
2059,1,"Good Night Cream_So far I really like this cream.  It goes on easy, isn't too sticky or gooey.  It keeps you moist, but you've absorbed it by the end of the night.  The smell is light and pleasant.  I only have a few wrinkles and they respond well to any moisturizer, so I can't say for sure- I just know I like it."
5585,1,"Wow! Can't believe it really works!!_So, I was browsing Amazon's 'best' products and ran across this nifty little gadget and all of the glowing reviews. After reading so many positive ones I decided to give it a try. I am thoroughly impressed by the product and the authentic reviews. It totally brightens my skin and has reduced the lines above my lip. It hurts and leaves a 'sunburn' appearance just like all of the other reviews have shared which help prepare me for what I was in store for and eased some anxiety I might have had otherwise. I am trying it on my legs now to see if I get some improvement there as well. Excited! Definitely a great find!"
3477,0,"Takes A Whole Lot of Soap for a Little Bit of Lather_I was excited to try a new body wash - especially one with a Papaya scent.Unfortunately, I was disappointed.The fragrance in this body wash is a bit too faint - which is a preference that varies from person to person.  So no stars deducted for that.However, I like a body wash that lathers up well.  The more suds, the cleaner I feel.  With this body wash, I had to pump out a lot of soap and still produced only half of the suds of similar soaps.Being made from natural products saved it from a one star rating from me.  But that is the only positive thing I have to say about it.It's not something I would consider purchasing."
7806,1,soooo bright and pigmented! perfect and easy to use_i want more colors to match my work uniforms...pigment is really intense and easy to apply over a thin layer of hair gel mixed with a lil water
3829,1,"I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it!_It is not as described, is much better. The colors are super pimentados and long lasting. This brand of cosmetics is not expensive, but if it is good. He had purchased the set of 22 brushes of coastal and was equally pleased. This palette is fantastic! I recommend it!"
3012,0,"Gets in my eyes_It seems like a good idea, and I have used some clear ones I like, but this one irritates my eyes a little. I think it gets in them."
3494,1,It works_I love this product.  I works.  I hate the price of course.  In the past I have stopped using it and replaced it with cheaper products but I keep coming back.  This product delivers beautiful glowing skin.
1188,1,"Great Deal!_Okay, so these are a far cry from Salon quality, however I contacted the seller (Jessica's Beauty) before purchasing to make sure I at least wasn't going to be receiving a dollar store brand like Love my Nails. She replied super promptly that I would not.I only received one brand I'm completely unfamiliar with, which was the scented one, the label looks super cheap so I question it's origins. Otherwise I'm super happy with the colors I received, I really got a great variety not just in colors but also a great mix of cremes, shimmers, and glitters. There's maybe one or two colors I won't make much use of but for the price I'd gladly order again in the future, especially if the seller would be willing to work with me to insure I didn't get repeats from this order.I haven't used them all to be 100% sure on opacities, but described them as best I could from the bottle. So here's what I got!CQ1.Ivory - a nice creme yellow2.Pistachio - a very pale mint green3.Eggplant - a dark grey...weird, thought they were purple lol4.Milk Chocolate - pretty self explanatory5.Shimmering Bark - a medium shade of brown with with a pink pearl undertone6.Gem Green - a light translucent green with a bright green pearlPetites: All of them are from a collection called Color Fever.7.Solar - A very deep purple shimmer8.Snowflake - A translucent shimmer white9.Fiji - a shimmering turquoise10.Virgo - Teal with white shimmer undertones11.Zodiac - A very bright jelly purple with glitter12.Raspberry Ice - Shimmering Magneta13.Neon Dream - Hot pink with a slight pearl14.Galaxy - a burgundy jelly with glitterSally Hansen15.Salon Laquer: All the white stuff16.Hard As Wraps: no name, kind of a mauve color17.No chip 10 Day top coatEssie18.Spaghetti Straps - a translucent soft pink, be great for french tipsWet n Wild19.Resolution - A shimmering turquoise, pretty close to Petites Fiji.BubbleGum:20.Scented, I assume it's Grape - an almost neon purple with holo glitter."
9295,1,"Who can really not like this stuff!?_This was a gift for my Brother's GF and she loved it, of course! I also got her a nail polish which is amazing!!! I love buying for her, I just think of what I want and *poof*. LOL I LOVE Essie!!!"
1480,1,"makes a real difference_Both my regular manicurists and me can see the difference---fewer hangnails, less dryness, longer lasting manicures.  I usually apply at night before bed and put on gloves in order to spare my sheets from stains and allow for maximum absorption."
1987,1,"Another great Konad plate!_Love this plate for doing at home french tip manicures. It takes a little practice to get the tips lined up just right and make sure they are applied evenly on the edge of the nail, but once you get it down, it's a breeze!"
9531,1,"Nice scent, good gently cleaning ability, not all that much lather_I like the scent of this shampoo &#8211; light and somewhat floral, but not really. It&#8217;s hard to describe, but it is quite nice. The scent does not linger excessively after being rinsed out.I can&#8217;t fault its cleaning ability or the fact that it is a pretty gentle shampoo. It does not lather all that well, however. Certainly not as much as other Suave shampoos I've tried.It&#8217;s a decent, but not spectacular shampoo. I prefer other versions of Suave over this, but it still merits 4 stars for its performance and scent (loss of 1 for its less than ideal lather)."
4516,1,love love love_Love me some bundle monsters. I have all their series and their binders too. This is a great starter set for a newbie to stamping.
286,1,"Works!_I have been using this for about a month now. I can certainly see a difference! My hair is fuller, is more manageable, and feels clean. I bought this because of a receding hairline. It has helped! Although, I can pick this up at VitaminShoppe in northwest Indiana for about $7 a bottle."
9966,1,great for children even_I did this with my daughter and she absolutely loved it I loved it the way it made the skin feel and I was worried about it because I have such sensitive skin so this wasn't an issue
9786,1,Makes your skin feel great_My boyfriend suffers from some redness and itchiness on his face so I was looking for the perfect product to try out to help him out with that. We were afraid of a bad smell that would be present but the mud smells so neutral and pleasant. It arrived in a very timely manner as well and was packaged properly. There was definitely no concern of it spilling anywhere and the box was in perfect condition. It dried quickly when it was applied in about 10 mins or so. It was easy to wash off with warm water in the sink. He said his skin felt nice and clean afterward. I really liked how his skin wasn't oily and it looked really nice the next morning. He said he noticed the redness seemed a little less and he wasnt that itchy. I really hope to have a nice long term effect to help his skin become noticeably less red and itchy without the use of prescribed medications. I will also be using this regularly to help me with the open pores i can see around my cheek area.
4116,1,"OMG...I LOVE THESE_I didn't realize they were going to be small, but the minute I started using them, I fell in love with them. But then again, that's what happened with all the rest of the Ecotools brushes I have. The quality is good and their price is even better. I made this brush set my 'brown' color brushes..."
532,1,"love this! better than BHA only gels_I was previously using murad's BHA exfoliating gel, but switched to this AHA/BHA exfoliating gel and it works better. BHA (aka salycylic acid) exfoliates the inside of your pores and AHA (aka gycolic acid) exfoliates the surface of your skin.I can definitely tell a difference by switching to a combination product because now the surface of my skin is being exfoliated in addition to the inside of my pores. My skin feels smoother and is clearer.I use this morning and night and also use vivant's derm-a-gel (a retinoid) on top of it at night. For face wash I use glytone's oily skin cleanser. I have moderate stubborn acne and this regime keeps me clear!"
2323,1,Life saver_A little goes a long with this stuff and if you purchased the Seche Vite Top Coat you will definitely need it. That stuff drys out so fast.. it is definitely a &#34;High Maintenance&#34; top coat.
7442,1,"Quality conditioner._We chose to try out the Clear Scalp & Hair conditioner to see if it's all it claims to be. Both my wife and I have used it, and I would have to say it's lived up to expectations. The conditioner is not as thick as the Clear Scalp & Hair shampoo that they recommend using with it for best results. We've found that the conditioner lathers up well and leaves our hair feeling smooth and refreshed. It has a pleasant smell which isn't overpowering, so both men and women alike should be able to use it with no problems or hesitation. Overall, using this over the past couple weeks in combination with the Clear Scalp & Hair shampoo, we've been mostly happy with the results. Definitely a worthwhile product to try and see if it's right for you."
1420,1,"Good, but not for those with sensitive bellies_I really like the company and have a hard time giving this stuff a bad review.  I bought it to help with constipation.  Unfortunately even the slightest amount gives me a distended belly.  I emailed the company with questions and got a response almost instantly.  I love that.  Plus all organic ingredients.  Gave it four-stars because of the reasons above, but also because it tastes yummy and helps me to drink more water.  Wish I could take it."
487,1,Strong smell but I love the product_I ordered these because my face has been looking haggard lately and needed something to tone my skin.  These work great after just two uses!  I noticed a difference in my face already.  The only con to these is the very strong smell! It got near my eyes and they were a bit sensitive to them (my eyes are sensitive to begin with).  It might not bother the average person but I did feel the scent was a bit strong (Although I do like the scent).
7464,1,"Excellent Conditioner for Long Hair_This conditioner has it all. It has a wonderfully feminine fragrance, and it leaves hair feeling nourished and conditioned, not dried out. And because it is highly concentrated, you use less of this product than you would of another conditioner. It is especially effective when used with Clear Scalp Strong Lengths Nourishing Shampoo. It leaves hair shiny and soft and fragrant!"
9706,1,"Leaves hair soft_I really like Clear hair products and this one is no exception. This is a once a week deep conditioning treatment that works for dry hair and scalp. You just use it as you would your regular conditioner. There is no strong scent and it rinses out clean. It did moisturize my hair pretty well. Not as well as doing a coconut oil treatment, but considering that takes hours to get good results, this does a very good job for a product that needs to be in the hair for less than 5 minutes. Even though Spring is supposedly here, the weather is still cold and miserable, so this product is great to have right now to protect my hair from the dry indoor heat and nasty outdoor cold."
4065,1,Compliments x 10_I never smelled this before I got it. But I took my chances with its great reviews and great price. I bought this approximately 4 weeks ago and have received at least one compliment every where I have been since. That's a lot of compliments. I am half way through my 1.7oz and am definitely buying the 3.4oz this time.
5751,1,Amazing brushes_I really noticed a difference in my makeup after using these brushes. My makeup went on smooth and the coverage was better than usual. Excellent quality.
5450,1,So thick and creamy!_I liked this product so much that I ordered it again.  Great price on AMZN compared to retail and arrives quickly.  This is one lotion that really makes my rough hands feel soft and pampered.  Also noticed a slight improvement in the appearance of my cuticles. Highly recommend.
4886,1,"a miricle_[ luv it!!!! This product does everything it said it does and more. It makes the hair silky soft the minute it goes on your hair. Its great for flat ironing, blow drying, and to use as a moisturizer leave-in treatment. you only need a dime size to  do the job. It  works like a shield toward breakage and dried-out brittle damaged ends due to flat ironing and blow drying.I luv all the chi products the entire line is fantastic."
9920,1,"Great hair dryer, but digital On-Off is tricky._My wife is using the Vidal Sassoon hair dryer, as my hair is very short!  She loves the feature of the &#34;digital touch&#34; slide bar for the heat & speed because it is RECESSED on the handle.  Her previous dryer had buttons that stuck out on the handle, and she was constantly turning them off while drying her hair.  What a pain!  Her only complaint is the &#34;digital touch&#34; recessed On-Off button. (Reason for 4 stars.) Originally, she thought the dryer was not working because it would not turn one, then realized that it took about five seconds for it to engage, and the same amount of time to turn off.....the paperwork says &#34;for a couple of seconds&#34;.  Overall, the dryer is a joy to use, and the digital technology is terrific.  It is lightweight, handles nicely, and easy to clean."
5483,1,"SUPER hot!_This iron is HOT! 445 degrees! My teenage granddaughters are using it here in the mornings One has curly hair and one has very thick wavy hair. This iron does a fast a job on both of them. They rave about how soft and silky their hair feels and it truly looks beautiful, and very shiny.In case you wondered, I haven't used it on my hair, because mine is super short and very, very straight! LOL!"
3207,1,Great light at a great price_I was very happy to obtain this since I can cure all brands of gel's with an UV light. This one has the added bonus that I can do both hands and both feet at the same time. Great quality for the price.
4062,1,so cute_just don`t use a flat iron while waering this it melts my daughter  did i told her to take it out what do i know i`m mom
2161,1,"Good oil_I use this for my hair and skin product concoctions.  I don't like the smell of Castor Oil much, but I usually add lavendar oil to sweeten it up.  The oil is moisturizing without being greasy, but I may use something with a lighter scent when this is finished."
9774,1,"Very good body wash... with one caveat......_Irish Spring has a distinctive scent, and this product carries it forward. The body wash works well.... cleans thoroughly, suds up and rinses off well.The one caveat relates to the exfoliating beads. The plastic beads that work so well for exfoliation are turning out to have, in aggregate, untoward effects on sewage systems. This product appears to utilize such beads, as do many other alternatives. You may want to be on the lookout for new formulations that work around this problem.In the meantime, if you're looking for a solid body wash, this is worth a try."
2543,0,"X-fusion applicator_Applicator worked great at first but then it started spraying the product out of the bulb that is pressed down. Purchased another one to only have a problem with that one too.  When it worked it was great, but it didn't last too long."
8910,1,"great for skin!_So, yeah-- black soap....What the?! Well ya know, I'm a believer, My skin feels great after using it; smooth and clean. The bar is a good quality and wasn't damaged in shipping. There is no greasy residue , no soapy feel and it deep cleans like nobody's business!  However, The run off in the shower is dark, so the walls of your shower look like you've been in the mud all day!! It washes away but knowing my hubby, he isn't going to rinse the walls down after his shower, so for that reason alone, I probably won't be sharing this with him."
294,1,A Nice New face_I can see a remarkable difference in the tone and feel of my face. It looks fresh and young again. I have been using this nightly for about a month now and I am really please. Expect you experience a minor exfoliation of the skin ( nothing drastic) . So this has become my nightly moisturizer. I will keep using it.
9820,1,"Great eyelash curler._This is a really nice eyelash curler. It's comfortable to use and curls the lashes very well. I can say that with other eyelash curlers I have pinched myself with them before but I haven't had that problem with this one. It seems like it might be a little wider than some which would make sense of there being no pinching on the corner of my eyes. Anyway, all in all this is a great curler and I totally recommend it for people with short lashes like me or even people who wear fake lashes. It will curl them beautifully.Disclosure Notice: I received this product for free in exchange for my personal and honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for this review and all thoughts and opinions expressed are my own."
4904,1,"This is for now on my 'One 'n Only'!_I'm in love with One 'n Only Argan Oil Moisture Repair Conditioner.  What I love about this conditioner is the conditioning affect can be felt the minute you put it in your hair as the strands of your hair becomes smoother and easier to manage.  The conditioning affect does not wash out, once you finish washing your hair and dry it the towel dried hair is still extremely soft, and tangle free.  Before I found this wonderful conditioner I would have to used a leave in such as Fekkai Glossing Cream in order to add manageability and to control but no more.  This conditioner has the best of two worlds for me and if they ever discontinue it I'm stocking up.As an Amazon Vine reviewer I've once did a review for Pantene Pro-v Curly Hair Series Dry To Moisturized Conditioner.  I had loved how nice my hair felt while I was in the shower with my hair wet.  After reading the ingredient list found that this quality if due to the ingredient Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone  and found  Dimethicone is a type of silicone used in conditioners to make hair shiny and slippery.  The Pantene conditioner did just this as long as my hair was wet but the minute I stepped out of the shower the silicone caused the strands of my hair to catch and tangle.One 'n Only Argan Oil Moisture Repair Conditioner not only contains Dimethicone but also Aragan Oil (Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil ) so the silicon (Dimethicone) remains lubricated which prevents it from snagging once water isn't providing that lubricant.I have tried the MoroccanOil brand and didn't find MorroccanOil to be all that great as it still left my hair frizzy.  The One 'n Only Argan Oil Moisture Repair Conditioner leaves my hair soft, shiny and frizz free and a great bonus is I do not have to use an extra leave in to once I step out of the shower.My hair type in case anyone wants to compare is usually semi coarse , thick, with a natural wave and once prone to frizzing.  It's black and I'm a Caucasion mix Asian heritage."
8143,1,"Very Convenient_My mom usually has to a few bottles of lotion that she uses everyday. When she goes out, she needs sunblock. At night, she needs body lotion. And when the weather is dry, she needs moisturizer. There's no problem with it until she travels. Nowadays, most people prefer to travel light and this Olay Total Effects 7 is a perfect solution for women who need lotions on a daily basics (like my mom). It works as advertised, nothing to complain about. When you have an all-in-one thing, you'll gain convenience. However, there's always a trade off. And in this case, it's money. The product is a little pricier than stand-alone Olay products. So, it's all up to you. I would recommend you have one for travel and use the stand-alone products on daily basics."
8800,1,Just like the photo_These look exactly like the photo & are the perfect size. I like that the colors were separated. The only problem noticed was that the gold ones turn silver when a top coat is applied. To fix that problem I secure them with a dab of nail glue instead of using the clear coat on top. So far so good & they seem to stay in place longer.
5629,1,"Love it!_This is a fun bright pink glitter, pretty close to what it shows in the picture, and you only need two coats perfect!!!!"
4417,0,"Proactive Repairing Solution_Overall I have used Proactive for many years and like the product, but I cannot give this more stars because it arrived in september (on time) but it expires this month in October.  So I basically got a product that expired 1 month after it arrived.  I had the same issue with the cleanser but the vendor refunded my money which I thougth was good customer service. So I have to give credit for that."
8636,1,"Fuzz fluffer_I stay away from hair dryers, for the most part, because they leave my hair wild and  frizzy. This one sounded like it might work a little better with the ionic feature.The dryer is quiet and the cool feature helps with the frizz.  I just haven't been able to get the hang of the 'difuser'. I keep whacking my skull. I think it would work better if you have very long, curly hair. Can't really pick up shoulder length hair."
7774,1,My fav&cheap_Im a bargain hunter...I was skeptical of the price but I fell in love with it.. worth the money in my book
2917,1,"Gentle on My Sensitive Skin_My skin tends to easily be irritated, and I appreciate Dove, as it does not irritate my skin. I do not like love the smell, however. Not sure how much more I should or could say about soap; but if you are like me the main thing you would be concerned about in choosing a new soap would be whether or not it is irritating to skin. It isn't, so 4 stars."
5061,1,LIKE THIS PRODUCT_A GOOD PRODUCT AND IT-S NICE TO MY ATOPIC EKSEM.LITTLE BIT HARD TO TAKE ON BUT OKAY.SMELLS OKAY.
4401,1,"Great product, weird smell._I love the results I got with this product. My hair felt soft and strong, and my curls were springy! I applied it like this: pre-poo (coconut oil and jamaican black castor oil), shampoo, then applied this to my hair with my fingers. Placed two plastic bags over my head and then wrapped that with a towel and left it on for about 30 minutes--I hate sitting under a dryer. Be sure to follow this up with a moisturizing conditioner. The only con is that it does smell like potato salad. I added a little lavender essential oil to mask the smell. I don't use the hair-typing system, but I have curly hair (picture Alicia Keys + Solange Knowles) that is partially springy curls, frizz, and tangles! I am definitely going to order this again. After reading other reviews, I think this product can be used as an intensive conditioner or a protein treatment, depending on what your hair needs. I don't think this is the correct product for a pre-shampoo treatment though (it's a little pricey for my taste to be the product that I immediately wash out)-I prefer coconut for a pre-poo treatment. The price isn't terrible, and it is definitely comparable to what I found in my favorite beauty shop. I feel this product is worth a try; if you don't like it, mix it with your regular conditioner for a deep conditioner once a month."
4125,1,"I love these!_I try to be as organic with what I put on my body as well as what I put in it. However, it seems to be hard for me to find organic hair products that I like.  I love these.  I have fine, long, thick hair and these do not weigh it down.  They seem to really nourish my hair and scalp.  Will continue to purchase these products!"
3484,1,"Wow, oh wow, oh wow!!_This is the greatest stuff ever!  It works as well, if not better than a S--box product that sells for 10x the price.  The pigmented gel that you use first looks too light, but the setting powder brings out the color perfectly.  SO impressed!My only complaint--and at $3, who cares--is that the provided brushes are wimpy.  Not a problem, there are plenty of inexpensive angled brushes on the market; use one of those.LOVE this product!"
8145,1,"Maybe It's Maybelline...._I'm usually not a fan of most Maybelline lip glosses...love this one, though!  And their Full n Soft mascara is definitely a staple in my makeup bag as well.&#34;Gleaming Grenadine&#34; is a gorgeous cherry red gloss with hints of blue.  My lips look full and sexy, and my teeth appear whiter thanks to this perfect red shade.  It can be worn anytime and I believe most ladies can pull this off, no matter what complexion you may be.  It adds drama to my already striking coloring (skin that ranges from light olive to very fair, depending on the season) and very dark hair.  It's bold without being over the top.  It doesn't come off on my teeth, either.  This is what I refer to as my &#34;bombshell&#34; gloss because I can wear a red lip every day if I want to, without looking clownish...it is a very classic red.  Kind of like an old Hollywood screen-siren type of red lip color.  It also leaves my lips feeling soft and hydrated.The packaging is very nice and simple...I love the doe-foot applicator as well, because it applies the color evenly and there is no gloss around the sides of the cap when the product is closed, which is a bonus.  The smell was initially a bit off-putting when I first opened it, but not unpleasant...kind of like a light citrus scent.  I prefer no scent at all in my lipsticks and glosses, but it's not a big deal.  I have no allergic reaction to this product.  I would definitely repurchase this.  One day I might try putting a bit on top of a red lipstick, just to see what it looks like when paired with another red...I'm sure the results might be even more intense."
2071,1,"Works Quite Well_This brand was recommended to me a while back but I avoided it because the name and packaging turned me off.  I finally tried three products in the line:  Come Clean Shampoo, Knot Together Leave-In Conditioner, and the Curling Custard.  Together, they work well to clean and define my curls. Be careful not to put to much in. The recommendations of trying a dime- or quarter-sized amount are sound."
9833,1,"Works very well!_I was asked to review this product.  All opinions are 100% my own.  I really liked this product.  I first tried it on my hair.  I have naturally curly, dry frizzy hair.  It didn't take much product on the little wispy hairs I have that are so frizzy.  It soaked in quickly so there was no greasiness.  I then tried it on my stretch marks on my stomach from my girls.  I noticed a slight lightening of them, hey anything is good there :).  I tried it on the heels of my feet.  I wear sandals nonstop in the summer which leads to dry heels.  It really helped the dryness there and that is not an easy thing to do.  I really enjoyed this product, it has many uses.  I would recommend it highly to everyone!"
236,1,"Free and Clear Cleanser_My four year old daughter has extremely sensitive skin. She was having rash after rash and other odd skin conditions until the dermatologist suggested this brand for all her cleanser, shampoo, conditioner, ect.  This cleanser works great and does not irritate the skin.  We  use for general hand washing and for bath time with ease.  My daughter doesn't love the same, mainly because there isn't one.  But it's a great product and would recommend."
6786,1,OMG :)_this tanning lotion is by far the best I have ever used. It makes you soo dark. The bronzers are strong too. I love this lotion. Im out but ill be buying more soon!
8183,1,"Good Cream!_This is a very interesting cream.  It is not greasy and is thicker than I expected.  The scent is a little strange somewhat medicinal with a hint of coffee.  When I apply it there is a slight tightening effect which doesn't last long, and my skin is soft and feels moisturized.  I did notice that it stated to reduce water retention, and in my case it does work for that.  Not much difference with the cellulite yet but it hasn't been that long."
5405,0,"Definately not worth all the hype_Sorry but this product suuuuucked to be quite frank:( It definately is not worth all of the hype it got or the money. You are totally paying for the name, not the product with this one. I didn't see a difference at all in my color and was very disappointed. It smells good, but that's about the only positive thing I could think of. I've never been a big fan of any of the australian gold products, but was hoping this would have been different. It's not though. I am more of a designer skin gal all the way. For me, their products are incredible and are the best when you want to achieve the deepest darkest tan. Obsidian is # 1. I've tried them all and that is the only one that gives me a noticable difference."
9985,1,mineral eye gel_This mineral eye gel also contains Vitamin E and Aloe Vera. I like the feeling and I like the fact that mineral gel. It absorbs into my skin. I only used like 4-5 times but already like it a lot.
2691,1,I love these towelettes!!_I love these! I use them for removing eye makeup!! Gets the job done! Highly recommend! AAAA ++++ And also smells nice!
8692,0,Not good_Disappointed - these were too dry to remove much of my makeup - barely took off the maybeline tattoo cream shadow. Should do okay with powder shadows but pretty worthless for waterproof mascara.  Hoping they work for touch up so it isn't a total waste of money.
6952,1,"Super Cute_I color my hair unnatural colors, so I can't always wash it because it'll fade.  This shower cap is fantastic, fits snugly so water doesn't get underneath and is adorable as well! Has a cute little bow in the front that you can't really see in the picture."
3007,0,Crap!_This stuff is crap. I don't even know where to begin. It is not waterproof. It smudges. The formula is too watery. The liner transfers to your eyelid if you have hooded eyes. I used eyelid primer and stay matte powder and it still transferred. The applicator is hard and doesn't apply the product well. After just a couple of hours I look like a raccoon. If I could find my receipt I would have taken this junk back. It's not worth a penny. I wouldn't give this mess to my worst enemy. Do not purchase this! Buy something else. Anything else!
897,0,"Contains cancer causing methylparaben_Methylparaben, which is readily absorbed through the skin, has been found in large quantities in human breast cancer cells.  In addition, when skin care creams containing methylparaben are exposed to UVB rays, cell death occurs and there is massive stress oxidation, which can cause disease and cancer.  I wouldn't put it on my skin and, as a skin care professional, I say not worth it."
846,1,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this!_Love this perfume, and was able to find it a lot cheaper than I did at a local store. Well worth it!!"
6931,1,"good quality_very decent, easy to stamp with, haven't had any problems and they are all standard size and fit in the sleeves in my books"
8330,1,"smells nice, feels good_I like this face wash.  It does provide a slight cooling sensation and has a fresh pleasant scent. However, at over six dollars for a 5 once tube, I would not consider this a good value because there are many other face and body washes for men from known brands available for significantly less.Additionally, the ingredients list Sodium Laureth Sulphate as #2, so if this is a chemical you've been trying to avoid, you should consider something else."
6653,0,"will not come off._Huge mistake...First, it didn't make my lashes 'bold and full of volume' as it promises. Just regular - after 3 coats!Second, at the end of the day this mascara wouldn't come off. I used my regular face wash, oil-free makeup remover, then another round of soap, and more oil-based makeup remover. The mascara stayed on, but did flake off a little bit. The next morning I had racoon eyes full of flakes. The mascara still partially stayed on. I will never use it again.I am going back to using CG's Exact Eyelights Eye-Brightening Mascara - does a great job on my lashes and comes off easily at the end of the day."
9578,1,Great Crystals!_The small crystals shines like a Swarovski crystal. I use these on nail designs and their shine lasts unlike some cheap crystals. Definitely worth buying for you nail designers.
585,1,"favorite conditioner_I've been using Aveda's color conditioners for a long time.  I use the Madder Root most often - especially now that my hair is darker.  I've had red hair (colored) for over a decade, which always fades - this does a great job at kicking it up.I don't know about the woman who said it doesn't smooth or detangle very well - that's precisely why I love it so much.  I have very fine hair that tangles easily, and my hair ALWAYS feels much softer & is easier to comb through when I use this, as opposed to any other conditioner."
1950,1,"This stuff is incredible, throwing out all of my expensive product. Look no further. FOUND IT!_I love love love it!  I have used so many of the more expensive products out there and this one is no joke. My face does pulsate as the mask dries and pulls.  I am a bit redfaced after I wash it off, but after that subsides, I am SO SHINY clean! I KNOW it pulls the dirt out of my skin.  NO other product that I am EVER used makes me shine they way this does.  I swear by it now and tell all my friends to throw out the expensive stuff.  This is the bomb diggity and I have no problem claiming it to be the best skin detox.  Twice a week with the apple cider vinegar is my routine.  I join the rest of the hundreds out there that love this product."
2405,1,"Way better than cutting up a sock, especially for the price_This is way better than cutting up a sock. It forms well and holds without bobby pins (unless you have heavy hair, of course)."
1866,1,Easy to Use_Just as described and easy to use for separating the hair into sections. This is perfect for long or thick hair in terms of conditions and styling as well.
4006,1,"Best value, works on hairline_After spending a great deal of time reading medical literature and trying different hair regrowth products, I can confirm that this product does work on the hairline. Oddly, the hair doesn't appear identical to that it replaced as it is thinner and more curly. It also can cause acne in the vicinity.  My hair loss was minor and I started using this product at the earliest sign of hair line recession.  This enables me to avoid appearing as the most senior gorilla in the &#34;band&#34; (presumably the evolutionary reason for male pattern hair loss).*********Other interesting fact:  Dermatologists have long said that gray hair could NEVER be reversed. As it turns out, cancer drug Gleevec, which costs about $30k/year, has shown to reverse gray hair in some patients."
8296,1,"A nice product_I'm not sure how well I can judge a product that's designed to be used in conjunction with another, because part of the overall effect of freshly washed hair comes from the shampoo that's used before the conditioner is applied. That said, I think this is a nice conditioner.I'm the sort of person who changes shampoo and conditioner every time I need to buy a new bottle, so I've tried quite a few brands. This one is better than some: it doesn't leave my hair (which is longish, straight, and very fine) feeling stringy or oily, and it's got a nice thick consistency straight out of the bottle. (Some cheap conditioners have a watery consistency that doesn't massage into hair well.) It also has a pleasant scent. I didn't like it at first because it's rather potent, but the scent dilutes once the hair is dry. And after about a week, I realized that I actually like how it smells.I can't say that this is the best conditioner I've ever purchased, or that I would specifically seek it out the next time I go shopping, but it's not bad."
3629,1,"Great color, slightly messy_I have blue eyes, this is a great accent for daytime wear without being too dark. I also have the burgundy color which I like but would probably be more flattering on brown or green eyes. The pigmentation is good, also would suggest trying the eyeshadows from L'Oreal HiP. I do not use this is in my waterline because I just feel a little iffy about putting loose type powder in this area, so I use this on my upper and lower lash line. That being said, a loose powder does sprinkle a little bit down my face if applying using a drawing motion but easily wipes away. I would recommend using a dabbing sort of motion to avoid this. This applicator tip is awesome, retains its shape and would be easy for beginners I think. Definitely worth a buy."
4746,1,Works as well as most light-less gel_I bought this and the gel cure. It works just as well as most light-less gel. Personally I think the UV gel holds better but this is good when you don't own a UV light or just don't have the time to wait for the UV gel to cure.
7105,1,Neutrogena Pink Grapefruit Cleansing Wipes_These cleansing wipes smell really great and are strong enough to remove waterproof makeup.  They leave your skin squeaky clean.
8053,1,"Superb Shampoo for Older Users from Pantene_I've been testing the Pantene Expert Collection Pro-V AgeDefy Shampoo for weeks and have to rate it highly. I think it does a fine job in controlling dandruff, even though that's not listed as one of its features. Designed for treating aging hair, I think this is a shampoo that should appeal to users of all ages. What it claims it does do is to reduce breakage, prevent split ends, tames frizz, controls unruly grays, minimizes lackluster color, minimizes the look of thinning and minimizes dryness. I can only attest to its usefulness in minimizing dryness; its other attributes may require further weeks of testing. It can be used with or without the accompanying Pantene Expert Collection Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner."
9173,1,"Great Set, and for a simple start, it was awesome!_These tools are very good.  I am having, for the most part, very good luck with both the stamper and the scraper.  It has been suggested to me to  buy different stampers to get a feel for different brands, which I plan to do, also.  There were a couple of designs I had to redo several times from plate to stamper, but after that, it worked great with terrific results.  Only thing I would say about the scraper, if you clean it with acetone, as I did, the paint comes off.  The manufacturer could just eliminate the painted part on the scraper side and it would be perfect."
3741,1,happy with my purchase_I bought this for my sister along with a white konad nail polish and one konad stamping nail art image plate for her birthday and she loved it.
5533,1,Best shine_I have used this since it can out.Have tried so many others n always come back to this one.Shines the best.Doesn't crack.Dries fast.
798,1,"Easy to use, barely visible difference_Easy to use, but only makes a very subtle difference on blonde lashes. Seems to build up a little over time, so I've even using it once a week to try to get a more noticeable tint."
9697,1,"Clear makes great products_I am not always a fan of drugstore brands, but Clear makes a quality product. This shampoo smells nice without being overpowering. It cleans without drying my hair out. The bottle has a good design, as it can be turned upside down when it is running out. If given a choice, I still prefer to use higher end products like Biolage, but I keep coming back to Clear as it is a great product that can be easily found in stores."
9074,1,"In love_A must have for any pink polish collector. Bright &#34;Barbie&#34; pink that wears bright. I have heard the pinks fade, but since I just put it on yesterday I cannot say much on that fact. The picture, as usual, does not convey the true color of this pink. It is not as dark. Remember to check for swatches before buying!"
3332,1,"SULFUR OIL MIX FOR HAIR GROWTH - AA REVIEW_I have 4 a/b hair and bought this to help aid my growth.  I made my mixture and have been using for 2 months now and I'm shocked and suprised to see that I have gained an inch 'EACH' month since I've started using it.  This mix works better for me than the MN Challenge and I have seen resuls much faster.  I highly recommend purchasing this powder if you are looking to make a hair sulfur mix just be extremely careful NOT to inhale any of the powder, I put a scarf over my nose when handling this powder.  The recipie I use is:NJoy's Sulfur Mix for Hair Growth1 heaping tsp Sublimed Sulfur Powder4 oz Organic Jojoba Oil2 oz Jamaican Black Castor Oil2 oz Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)4-5 drops Rosemary Oil (optional)4-5 drops Peppermint Oil (optional)'My' mix1 heaping tsp Sublimed Sulfur Powder4 oz Jamaican Black Castor Oil4 oz Wild Growth OilThe way I use it is I apply a small amount in my problem area on my scalp every night or every other night, baggy (cover my head with shower cap) and wrap my scarf around my head and that's it! I personally don't get a lot of buildup on my scalp and I usually wash once every two weeks or once a month."
2455,1,Feels devine_I received this 2 days ago and really like the smell and the texture of this product and it's a plus that is all natural. I think this is a product that would be perfect in the winter time for my dry chapped hands. My hands felt silky smooth the next day. I would purchase this product for sure and it would make a great gift!
195,1,"A Gentle Sunscreen_This product is an excellent source of texture refinement, sunscreen and moisture.  I actually prefer a stronger SPF, so I use the regular Regenerist Regenerating Serum and add a stronger sunscreen."
7579,1,"Hair Saver!!_This is the best product I've used for my hair.  I have cut the split ends off my hair until it's all the way up to my shoulders and it's still splitting. I only blow dry it every now and then so the ends aren't because I over style it. My hair started doing this when I was pregnant, I'm assuming with the hormone changes. My hair looked like hay at the ends. This set has FIXED my hair!! You will not be disappointed."
6149,1,love it_I love this product... before I heard about this on youtube.. I would have to hold my wigs in my hands to brush out or style but with this I can actually clamp it any where i want and style.. it really holds tight to whatever you put it on and it can be adjusted really easily.. love it love it..
1723,1,"Great color without clumping... perfect for sensitive eyes_For those with sensitive eyes and skin, it's essential to find mascara that doesn't clump excessively and that refrains from irritating the eyes. While skin sensitivities are clearly a highly personal and unique matter, Ecco Bella Brown mascara was the first mascara that has ever worked for me without in some way causing irritation to my skin and eyes. I am also thrilled with the ease by which I am able to control how much mascara is applied at any one time, so there is no risk of clumping lashes together.This mascara is the perfect color to complement my eyelashes, and I found it even works as a means for coloring sun-bleached eyebrows, when carefully applied in moderate quantities. It's wonderful to know that this mascara is natural and organic... something that those with sensitive eyes and skin will rejoice in, as they are able to wear it free from pain and irritation.Ecco Bella brown mascara comes with a completely surprising and very delightful feature -- a mirror built right in to the side of the bottle, so it's always easy to see how much mascara is being applied, even if there's no wall mirror available at the moment.Ecco Bella Brown Mascara is the perfect long-lasting, non-irritating mascara for blondes and light brunettes who wish to be able to carefully control the amount of mascara they apply without clumping. It's awesome!"
1194,1,"Will change how you see foundation_The best thing with this sponge is you can use the cheapest makeup and have it look flawless. If you don't already have one, purchase, it won't disappoint. And the cleaner will last you half a lifetime"
6846,1,"INGREDIENTS; lathers well, rinses clean with no build-up, smells great..._My husband has been using Suave Professionals Men's 2-in-1 Ocean Charge Shampoo & Conditioner for about 2 months now with great success. It cleans and conditions all in one step, is inexpensive, lathers well and rinses clean with no build-up on his hair. It leaves his hair clean, shiny, healthy looking and smelling great (he and I both love the scent). We give this shampoo two (or four) thumbs up.ADDITIONAL INFORMATION YOU MIGHT FIND USEFUL:According to Suave's website, Suave Professionals Men's 2-in1 Ocean Charge Shampoo & Conditioner  'was designed for the specific needs of men's hair and is suitable for all hair types' and it 'is salon proven to clean and condition hair as well as American Crew Daily Shampoo'.American Crew Daily Shampoo is for normal to oily hair and scalp and is advertised as a 'Gentle, natural, cleanser that doesn't strip natural oils from the hair, adds shine and strength, and avoids drying hair and scalp.'INGREDIENTS (Suave Professionals Men's 2-in-1 Ocean Charge Shampoo & Conditioner): Water (Aqua), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Dimethiconol, Sodium Chloride, Fragrance (Parfum), Carbomer, Glycol Distearate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, TEA-Dodecylbenzenesulfonate, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Citric Acid, PPG-9, Panthenol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Blue 1 (Cl 42090), Red 33 (Cl 17200)."
623,1,"I love is stuff!_This is the perfect stuff to use before shaving! Nothing works quite like it. I got really into it after buying it on impulse when I was at Costco quite some time ago. The thing that bums me out though is that I bought it at Costco for $5/16 oz tub. FIVE DOLLARS! I bought three and then they were gone from Costco. So, when I went to buy some online, I was shocked to find out that it was sooooo much more expensive. I wish it wasn't so dang expensive. But, the product is great."
1943,1,"Bouncy is the secret!_I like this product so much. It makes my hair feel bouncy and not flat!  I recommend it on clean hair - wash your hair well, apply it and put it under the steam for 30 minutes then rinse and feel heavenly.So here is how I use it in details: I wash my hair with shampoo very well so it is not oily and clean.  I then put the mask on it by dividing it into strands. By the end of this process, all my hair is covered with the mask.  Just under my house there is a beautiful hair saloon which has a steamer. So I go use it for 20-30 minutes and wash it afterwards.  It feels awesome!"
5199,0,"Not for me_This product had a bad odor and I contacted the seller who told me that it is natural.  I could not stand it so I threw it out.  If you can handle odd smell, go for it."
4410,0,"Not so great_This palette isn't very pigmented and the lighter colors are very chalky. The white eye shadow has a green sparkle to it. The colors are also very hard to blend. You could easily end up with muddy eye shadows. If you do buy this palette, be prepared to pack on the color."
9703,1,"Ok_I have thick, curly hair and this worked fine, but was nothing remarkable. Worked much like Pantene products I've used in the past"
9230,1,Nice Staying Power_This actually really helped get a lot of volume in my hair while blow drying with a round barrel brush.  The product is white and is a lotion consistency and does not make me feel greasy at all.  The product gives my hair substance so when I am blow-drying it with a barrel brush it latches onto the bristles of the brush and allows me to get a nice lift.  The product smells nice and works well and would definitely recommend.
1979,1,"Great for stamping_This polish is great for stamping! I tried quite a few different brands of black (Sally Hansen, China Glaze, Wet n Wild) before committing to buy this. I'm very glad I made the switch. The other polishes were alright, some worked better than others, but they weren't ideal for stamping. They were too thin, too translucent.The Konad Stamping polish is very thick and very opaque. It's perfect for stamping. Your designs will stamp very crisply and neatly. This color shows up very well against a variety of base coats.You can certainly make do with other polishes but the Konad polish really is formulated specifically for stamping. You don't need all of Konad's special polishes but I recommend at least getting the black and the white. They will truly increase the quality of your stamping."
153,1,"super easy to use, great curlers_super easy to use, get nice and hot but the curlers have cover-y things that keep me from burning my hands.  It's pretty small so it didn't take up a lot of space when i packed it in a carry on last week.  They give nice curl or good volume depending on what you are looking for.  The only thing I wish is that there was an on/off switch instead of it just turning on when plugged in."
2986,1,"Beautiful!_Now that it's almost holiday season, I will definitely be using my red Konad polish a lot more! Show's up well and that's the important thing!"
8005,1,bigger than I expected_I LOVE this stuff! I use it to set concealer under my eyes I wish I would have found this stuff a long time ago and I will buy it againRecommend this product for dark undereye circles works wonderss
3068,1,"It's good_It's a nice starter to the more high end irons. It is ceramic and all that. I mean it's a reasonably priced high end iron. It does snag the hair thought and that sucks. And the Argan oil they sent me spilled in the box all over my cute little pouch for the iron. I like it, and it's held up well. It worked great when I did my BKT. It does make me want to by a CHI or FHI now to see how much greater it can get!"
3,1,"Lurrrrrrrrv....._So I got this about a month ago. I had no plans of buying anything that day, but I ended up getting it. I absolutely love Prada Candy, I have worn it everyday since I bought it- I practically ditched all my other fragrances!!! It is a far cry from the Prada infusion d'Iris...and all the other Prada fragrances. They got it right this time..... Like everyone has said, it's a warm and sweet smell but it doesn't last long...I practically douse myself in it!! I guess the only solution is to spritz this over and over (rather cumbersome!! I know, but hey, no other solution in sight), or better-still layer it if they decide to introduce its body lotion or body cream into the market. One other thing that I wish they'd change is the spritzer thingy ( I don't know what it's called )- it's not very reliable in my opinion as you could easily pull it off in trying to figure out how it's used. Otherwise, it's a great fragrance and I love it."
1435,1,"Excellent_This conditioner is just great.  I have very dry, fine, curly hair.  Did I mention it was dry?  There is something about this product that my hair really likes, particularly the dry ends.  It does a great job of adding/keeping moisture in.  And I really like the fact that it's a leave-in product.  That means all the moisturizing goodness is absorbed by the hair shaft rather than washing down the drain."
1495,1,For my daughter_Cheaper then the retail stores. My daughter has long hair and uses this quite often. She loves it. I tried it but it didn't give me the exact result. Different hair.
217,1,"Can't do without this wonderful product!!!_This is one of those products that I just can't do without! It smells so heavenly that I don't mind doing dishes.  It smells of roses and geraniums. I am extremely sensitive to scents as I have allergies but although this scent is 'obvious' (I dont want to say anything too strong to deter someone from trying it) I have absolutely no problems with it - as does the rest of my family.  My 5yr old also has allergies and when I clean the counters with this scent, he'll 'sniff' the table :-) and sigh.As an added bonus, it cuts grease wonderfully but the BIGGEST benefit in my opinion is that it MUST have that special vegetable ingredient like in her Counter Top Spray that cuts odors (try cooking something stinky in your microwave or spilling tuna water from the can on your counter...use her Geranium Counter spray, wipe it down and sniff it out...nothing but heavenly geraniums to please your sniffer.)  I SWEAR, I have an extremely sensitive sniffer and can't keep 'smelly' items in my garbage can in the kitchen even for a little bit, I have to take them to the outside trash (tuna cans, overly ripe veggies, etc).  With one teeny drop in a tuna can, swirled around with some water - no scrubbing on my part, it cuts the odor so well that I can toss it in the trash and not think of it again. I can wash a cookie sheet of fish sticks with no odor and so many others.  Did I say that I can't be without this product?? :-)I just wish that Amazon sold a package of her various products or in single bottles...I can't very well keep 30 bottles of several of her items in my home...that would be insane."
8632,0,"Too flowery for me..._This is the first time I've tried a Nexxus product and eh, it was ok. I used it in combination with the leave-in conditioner (Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Leave-In Conditioning Foam, 5.5 Ounce) for 2+ weeks. This review combines them both, as I always used them together.I've tried several hair products in the past, but I've never been impressed enough to switch from using my regular 2-in-1 from Suave.Anyway, I didn't really notice much difference in my hair, except for reduction of static! Now, was it the shampoo...or conditioner...or the weather? The weather has been changing, and I usually only have a terrible problem with static during the winter. Hard to say...?I focused on my ends when applying the conditioner. It, too, was ok, but I didn't notice much, if any, difference in my hair for the extra step of work it took me. I always think foam conditioners are hard to apply evenly. Globs in one area, nothing in the next...The scent of the shampoo wasn't my favorite. It was more floral than I prefer. When lathering, I got a quick burst of citrus, but a flowery smell is the prominent scent. Thankfully, it was light and didn't linger on my hair. Well, a very slight clean floral smell, but not like some shampoos where every time you turn your head, you get a huge whiff of your shampoo all.day.long. So, it was ok, but I personally wouldn't buy this shampoo for its scent. The conditioner also had a similar floral smell.I think hair care products are hard to accurately review as everyone's hair is different, so results will vary from best-ever to worst-ever! Also, scent is a very subjective matter! What I hate, you'll love...and vice versa! So, you'll just have to try it yourself - you may love it! For me, it's back to good ol' Suave."
8605,1,"Quick Solution For Awesome Nails_I use these when I am feeling lazy and don't want to bust out all the powders and stinky liquids plus do a design! Great for painting- cheap and expensive nail polish  can be used without noticeable nail quality compromise! These hold color well, no colors light or dark that I have used bleed and it lasts. For the price - I love these!"
5014,0,"Doesn't do what promise_I bought that eye cream because I've got dark circles and puffiness. I bought products from Watts Beauty before and that was the main reason to have chosen Vanish.I use it 2,3 times a day and for more than 2 months and really I have notice any single change.I'm not buying it again!"
2425,1,"For Natural Hair Care_I use this product to seal my natural hair during the winter..it does wonders!! I have woken up in the morning with an itchy scalp due to the dryness that cold weather brings. I have a tight curl pattern after transitioning to natural hair. As part of my hair care regime, I mix aloe vera gel, NOW Foods Vegetable Glycerine and a bit of MSM powder in a spray bottle. The Glycerine acts like a sealant on my hair, not too greasy or oily. It definitely stops the itching (along with the Aloe Vera gel too). I recommend this product and keep it around all winter."
2148,1,Great product!_I discovered this product a couple years ago and used it in a moderately hot climate witout breaking out with sun rash.  Up until then my sun sensitivity kept me covered up all Summer.  Last Summer for the first time I was able to wear tank tops again.  I am now in a the superhot Afghan climate and so far it has been protecting my skin very well.  Great product!
2441,1,"Surprisingly useful_I've seen these advertised, and though I was interested, I was very skeptical about the claimed results.  After using this on myself and my resident teenager, I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised.If you're looking for a cure-all, you'll be disappointed.  It works best on blemishes that are... well 'ripe' is the word that comes to mind.  You know what I mean - the ones that you're itching to pop, even though you know better than to do it.  It's no use at all on blackheads or cyst-like pimples (and the manual spells this out).The 2.5 minute heat treatment isn't painful, but it is a bit uncomfortable and it leaves behind a red circle that looks like a mini-sunburn.  The redness fades after a couple of hours, but it makes me reluctant to use it in my morning routine.The instructions claim that most blemishes are clear after two or three treatments, and that proved accurate for the 'ripe' pimples I treated.  I also tried it on an emerging pimple on my chin.  After two days and three treatments, the bump is smaller and less noticeable, though it hasn't completely disappeared.The device does a good job of providing feedback through LEDs and tones.  The treatment tip is good for 45 uses - after that you'll need a replacement tip."
210,1,Serum_Serum goes on smoothly and sinks right in.  I always use the Perfecting Cream on top in daytime and the night cream over it in the evening. My skin seems clearer and softer after only about a week.
2995,0,falls apart when using_Maybe I am using it wrong but I keep trying to do it and it kept breaking the tip off. I will never order this one again.
6158,1,"The best at removing makeup so far_I really like this facial cleanser. I was looking for a nice moisturizing facial cleanser that would remove all of my makeup, especially the mascara. Though it does not completely remove all of the mascara, it comes the closest of the many products that I have tried."
9308,1,VoilaVe For Me_VoilaVe For Me or should I say my wife! I ordered this serum for my wife in hopes of combatting the Dry Arizona weather and of course the effects of the blazing sun. At this point I can say that her skin is looking refreshed and not so tight and dry as it was. She loves the ease of application and was really pleased with the follow up that we have gotten. All of this and great shipping experience too!
4807,1,"Bare Escentuals & Oily Skin_I bought the two-pack, came just as you see in the picture. The product works well, I have tried worse, so I am most definitely pleased. I have oily skin and I can definitely notice a difference when using these. I usually use 1 sheet at a time for my normal oily days. If it counts for anything, Bare Escentuals is the makeup I use nearly everyday and these oil absorbing sheets don't seem to take any makeup off my face- just oil. Does what it says and I'm content so 5 stars."
4111,1,Ok_They work well enough. My only complaint is that some of the smaller brushes are so stiff that they can be uncomfortable on the delicate skin around my eyes
7050,1,It works and I will continue to use_I love RoC products. They work and you can see and feel a difference. Sometimes it can burn near your eyes but my face feels smoother and softer. It does not do much for wrinkles though. No miracle for that except Juvaderm and Botox
2491,1,Excellent_This is perfect for my lazy manicures. I just throw on a coat and then do whatever because it dries so quickly. It leave my nails with a nice shine and makes them look like I put way more effort into my hand maintenance.
680,1,"One of the Best Men's colognes ever designed_I have tried hundreds of colognes and own scores of top of the line ones myself. Over the years that I've been studying, using and exploring men's colognes, this is without doubt amongst the best that I have seen. A true timeless gem in the world of creative perfumery. Thank you Mr. Armani for this wonderful gift to the world of men's fragrances."
461,0,"Disappointing_Did nothing to prolong manicure.  Many other base coats to choose from, this isn't a good one.  Too bad.  I really love CHINA GLAZE nail filled."
7422,1,"Clear - Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Shampoo, Total Nourishing Care_Note: This review was made by Ron's girlfriend as she used the product.This shampoo has a great scent and silky texture!  I am able to use a smaller amount than my regular brand to create a nice lather that rinses easily (and I have hard water, so that is a challenge with some other shampoo brands).  I haven't needed to use a conditioner after I use this shampoo, because it does a great job on its own of making my hair silky, soft and non-frizzing.  I've also been able to use less product in my hair to keep my hair from being frizzy or unmanageable.  My hair feels lightweight and very clean, not the heavy or unhealthy-looking buildup you can get with some shampoos. So, economy and effectiveness get scores of 5, but the only negative I experienced is that my hair is significantly less shiny than normal.  Usually when I can achieve less frizz then my natural hair gloss comes out, but not so with this shampoo.  Nonetheless, I will continue using this product, and will try other varieties of this company's shampoos, because of all the other positives."
3997,1,"Seems to work_I think this product is making my age spots fade away.  Only thing is, it has a strong perfumy smell.  To keep the smell from my face, I have decided to use this on my arms and legs.  Small, but noticeable difference.  I bought this in a two-pack and gave my 78 year old mother one.

8997,0,"Why would I use this?  Ick ick ick._Oh my.  This is some interesting product for hair.  I'm not entirely sure who it is intended for: if it's for men then maybe that's the problem.  But for a woman, I'm not sure who would be satisfied with this.I have nothing against powders: I like the Oscar Blandi dry shampoo that blends in well and adds a day extra of clean hair.  But this is a styling product that just feels gross and annoying on my hair.For one thing, the blending in: it suggests at the roots and at layers.  For that, it's difficult to blend in and feels like my hair is suddenly dirty with residue on my scalp.  Not a great feeling, especially as that residue seemed to migrate down my face as the day went on.  Then there's the question of what the style is: is it for volume? Shaping?  Piecing?  None of these seemed to happen when I used this as described.Additionally, it's messy for clothes and for bathrooms: when I opened the box it spilled all over (the dispenser is not very tight), and when I went to use it I found it everywhere."
1277,1,"Astonishing Magical Hairbrush_I just can't believe it.  Seriously.I have wavy/curly hair that tangles and mats pretty easily, especially while I sleep.  I've never been able to brush or comb it after washing it, while it is still wet; that just pulls, rips and shreds my hair.  I also avoid blow-dryers since those also trash my hair.  So obviously it has been a major hassle having to wait for my hair to dry naturally and then fight with the tangles and mats.  After years of this, I really found it a daily dread.The only reason I bought this brush was that so many people left positive reviews; but even with that, I was dubious.I just got it and tried it today.  I absolutely cannot believe it.  Not only did it untangle my hair and some bad mats while my hair was wet, fresh from the shower, but it did not hurt or pull while using it.  It also did the job amazingly fast, I mean like in a few minutes.When you look at the brush, it doesn't appear to be any different than many other brushes.  Touching it, you can feel that it has a very loose flex, which seems like it wouldn't be capable of doing anything.  That I think is the secret.  As you brush, it grabs and untangles the hair at the surface first, then works down into the deeper part of the tangle.  The bristles will glide over the deeper mats.  So, just like you would do manually to untangle your hair, the brush pulls the tangles apart gently from the outside in.The fact that the bristles will so easily glide over the core of tangles that it hasn't yet worked out, is why the brush doesn't hurt.  It won't catch up in the midst of the tangle and yank on your hair.I strongly recommend that you give this brush a try. It's worth taking the risk for the low cost and the fact that so many of us have found this to be downright miraculous; hopefully it will be for you too.  Just remember the key is to let the brush do the work.  Don't try to force it, but just keep gently brushing.  Let the bristles glide over the tangles as it will.  Soon you'll begin to feel that the tangles are loosening, and the bristles working in deeper naturally, until the tangles are gone!"
8387,1,Super pretty_The colors are pretty but they aren't divided great but oh well. The stones have height so they definitely stick out a bit but there still pretty.
7939,1,Awesome Tools_Great price for great items. I use them all the time and never have any problems. Bag is big enough that I have room for my other brushes.
6210,1,"love it!_This works great for my brushes. it really gets all the guck and dirt out of my brushes.because you have to clean your brushes weekly i just wish the bottle was bigger so that way it would last me longer, but over all great product."

3754,1,"Gets The Job Done!_I am writing this review as i sit under the dryer. I recommend this dryer just because it gets hot quickly, stays hot, and is quite portable.The pros:Large bonnetLong hosePretty decent length power cordGets hot and stays hotCons:The lid has to stay open while the dryer is on limiting where you can sit it, and I almost broke it off one day by accident.The hair in back get dried first and you have to spot chec the front.The hose gets really hotThe bonnet is really large so if you plan on doing conditioning treatments you will have to jerryrig the bonnet to not fly off. I just gave up and bought a conditioning capMany other reviewers state that their bonnet has ripped, or the hose clip has broken. Mine has not yet but i can easily see how that can happen. I try to take great care in not taking the bonnet off too fast and i try not to really move much when i am using the dryer.Good dryer for the cost and i hope it lasts foralong time"
9285,0,"Overpowering scent_I am mildly allergic to most Herbal Essences products (they cause me scalp to break out in sores), but when I saw that they had a &#34;Naked&#34; Cleansing Conditioner, and when I read that it is a competitor to my expensive infomercial cleansing conditioner, I bought it.  I thought the &#34;naked&#34; label might mean there are fewer chemicals in it, and thus I would have fewer issues.Thankfully, I don't seem to be allergic to this cleansing conditioner.  That's a good thing.  HOWEVER, a bad thing about this cleansing conditioner is that I don't think I can use it very often because the floral scent is SO overpowering that I feel sick when I first pump it into my hand.  It gives me a terrible headache!  Washing it out doesn't help all that much because the scent lingers.  Ew.I tried it cleansing conditioner a few times, and never got accustomed to the floral scent.  It is very, very strong.As a product, I think this cleansing conditioner is about as effective as a 2-in-1 shampoo.  While this product doesn't contain sulfates, so it isn't as harsh as a 2-in-1 shampoo, it isn't effective as a conditioner at all.  My hair wasn't left feeling soft in the least.  Therefore, I'd say this is NOT a competitor for the expensive infomercial cleansing conditioner."
763,1,"Pink Hair turban wrap_I own 2 of these already in 'White' and they're great. I thought the pink was cute and I liked the packaging so I've given these to 2 of my friends as gifts. Both of them love them. So much better than using a towel on your head, which falls off. These hair turbans are the best way to go! I recommend having 2 of them. One for back up while the other is in the wash."
7967,1,Beautiful color_I really love gelish. I've tried other gel polishes and those don't have the same consistency. Gelish always seems to be super easy to put on and is pretty opaque after two layers of color.
4261,1,"Perfect!_I have a really cheap, crappy, laminate vanity in my condo right now. I was really afraid of burning it and making it worse. This works great for protection - I use high heat (350-400 degree) tools. One day I even forgot to turn one off. Came home, nothing melted, nothing damaged."

6099,0,"LONG LASTIN ?_I buy this product becuse the reviews all them say this lipstick arelong lasting like you well see that reviews , BUT NOI give two stars because have nice colors are creamy and soft to usebut the true is are 'not long lasting at all' in my opinion this product are over priced"
3236,1,"Too big_I placed an order thinking they would be the medium size clips, but they are actually the large size. Will have to return them because i only use the medium size. This one give me a headache"
7409,1,"Amazing!!!_First off I received this super fast and in perfect condition! It's such a great palette shadows are very pigmented with great color payoff.I am a makeup junkie and this is my first sleek makeup product, now I plan to buy more and for  the price you cannot beat this!I highly recommend!!!"
9971,1,"Skin feels refreshed!_I have the facial serum, mud mask, and the soap as well as the conditioner. Using these products have completely changed my skin! The firming serum has done wonders in almost eliminating my crows feet, and even helped to tighten up underneath my chin, leaving me with just one again ;) I have sensitive skin and NONE of these products have caused any type of irritation or reactions when using them! Plus the serum does not have the oily feel, or heavily scented smell other products produce.Adovia's skin care has truly been a godsend in helping to restore my skin to the younger looking 26 year old I am,instead of the old tired woman I looked like!If you are in the market to try something new, I would suggest ANY one their products! They are wonderful!"
8374,1,"Beautiful_This is a beautiful sparkly blue, just like sapphires.  It fully covered in two coats.  I would recommend to everyone."
8321,1,"Suave Products Are Great_I've never been disappointed with Suave.  My family uses many of their products from body wash to shampoo to hair spray.  They are quality products for a reasonable price.This is a new shampoo for me, but I really liked it.  The scent was fresh and clean and not so like perfume.  I don't like strong scents.  It washed well.  I also used it for bubbles in the tub, and it worked well for that use.  It left my hair soft with a nice clean scent.  My husband (who is very sensitive to scent and has many allergies) even commented that the scent was good for him.My one complaint is that I wish this was a shampoo/conditioner.  I like to use a 2 in 1.  I did use it without adding conditioner and am finding that it works fine.  But I'd like to see this scent in a combination shampoo/conditioner."
4767,1,Slide & Glide_This little Godsend is ideal for when you are literally having a bad hair day and want to smooth it all over.  Remington has been a long established brand in hair restoration and this high-tech flat iron will gentle hair gone awry and is very easy to use.  You do get high caliber results and the digital controls on this product lock so you don't have to worry about overheating your hair.  Just be sure to follow the directions that come with this item and you will enjoy plenty of smooth hair sailing days.
4705,1,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff!!_I am 41.  I started using this back when it was called 'Malibu Hemp Golden Glow'.  This product is first a great moisturizer.  It has a lovely smell and makes my rough skin feel super soft.  I apply it just out of the shower, and once I am completely dry, I apply it once more.  It makes my skin feel like silk!  Second, it is a sunless bronzer.  It isn't as dark as most bronzing lotions are, which is perfect for people with very light or light complexions.  Don't expect to see any color with just one application though.  I am very very pale, and for me, it takes 3-4 applications over a couple of days before I will notice my skin get any darker.  Anyway, I don't really use it for the bronzer, I use it for the moisturizer, which is way better than anything else I have tried.  In fact, I applied it 4 times in one day once, because I wanted to see how much color I'd get, and by the end of the day my skin was so soft it was almost slippery.  Even my boyfriend commented on how soft my skin was.  I always keep a couple of bottle on hand.  My big worry is that some day they will quit making it.  My local Target used to sell it, but now I can only find it here."
8821,1,Nice :)_I use this more often before I color my hair and I can tell it makes a huge difference. Also makes my hair shiny and so very soft. Defiantly a good buy and will buy again.
9027,1,"Super amazing product! You will NEVER but another Shea Butter_I love shea butter ... have bought it for years ... lots of years.  It is the best thing for my skin and my family's skin.  I wanted to try a new brand and I loved the reviews this one received.  WOW ... I.N.C.R.E.D.I.B.L.E!!! First of all, it smells ... AMAZING ... I mean ... it is beyond gorgeous.  Another plus is that is it so refined that it absorbs immediately.  My eight year old daughter, who hates ALL lotions, loves this one.  I think it has to be the scent and that it absorbs so quickly.  I have to get mad to her to put lotion ... no .. here she does it on her own.  My husband uses it for his hands, elbows, and knees.  I bought two more and one is in our family room because we decide to apply while we watch TV.  I assure you that you will love it.  I give it a SUPER high recommendation.  A+++++"
9277,1,"Just right._If a foundation brush is what you use for foundation, this one is exactly right. I don't know if it has to do with  the height, density yet softness ,or all combined, but this one is a keeper.  Good purchase!"
1888,1,"One of the best!_This serum is one of the best in the market, you can feel the difference right away, in your first use, and when you keep using it, it work wonders!"
9178,1,Good product_This was really a good product . After having a baby my stretch marks were really bad after using the product I really noticed a difference
3388,1,"THE BEST BB CREAM OUT THERE!!!!_THE BEST BB Cream out there. Color is perfect, I am fair. I am 64 and when wearing this bb cream people comment on my skin, even asking me if I have had something &#34;done&#34;. Foundation was making my skin look much older, so glad I found BB Cream, and this is the best by far. I finish it with rice powder, also bought on Amazon and it is beautiful."
5285,1,works great! Huge bottle!_works great to remove even glitter polishes. Doesn't stink up a storm. A little goes a long way. It comes in a huge bottle so this should last a while. I am a fan of this!
2322,1,Apple on the go_Love my DKNY and now I can have it on the go.  This is the perfect size to fit into my purse of hand bag.  It has a great roller ball for quick application and I do love this perfume so this was a must.
1745,1,"A luxurious gift for a mother to be_I have been rubbing this (lavender & sweet almond oil & other plant extracts) on a scar from knee surgery and although it's too soon to tell whether it will have an effect, I had to write now just to say how divinely it smells and how luxurious it feels to rub it onto my scar.  It's a sensually pleasurable experience.  Not every pregnant woman ends up with stretch marks but any mother to be would feel very pampered and wonderful rubbing this oil onto her belly, and if it should prevent stretch marks too, so much the better."
435,1,"Good product_I like how big the bottle it. I use it everyday, but I wish it had some kind of pump to get it out. I luckily had a old facial wash bottle with a pump and poured some in there to use. It makes it so much easier. This bottle def last for a long time. I will be buying it again."
801,1,"My fave!_I yet have to find a better shine spray then Biosilk. Yes, its expensive but sometimes for a good prodcut you gotta drop the cash ;)"
8642,1,"A Salicylic Acid Miracle!_I'm going to piggy back off of the review I did for Clearasil's Rapid Action Facial Wipes and talk about how I use the 2% Salicylic Acid this gel wash also contains and why this is such a good product for a person of any age (not just the teen set). As I mentioned in my previous review, Salicylic Acid has been around since ancient times and there are many many uses for it in medicine. It's an anti-inflammatory, a preservative, and a topical skin treatment product, among its many other medical, curative/healing uses. It comes from a variety of plant sources around the world including some types of tree bark but I think what we use today mostly comes from natural fruit sources like berries, melons, tomatoes, peppers, olives, and some mushrooms. I use the wipes at night before I go to bed so the product stays put while I sleep and have been using the wash in the morning which I rinse off completely. When I say my skin looks absolutely smooth and even without even a sign of a blemish, believe me, it's true. The natural exfoliating alone, thanks to the 2% Salicylic Acid you get in these Clearasil products, is miraculous. 2% is more than enough. You don't want to overdo any type of acid/exfoliating product. The older you get, the more helpful exfoliating is.The gel wash is about 7 ounces and runs just under $10. I would recommend using these in conjunction with the wipes. You won't be able to buy even one Prestige item for the cost of both of these. Salicylic Acid (2% is enough) is the only ingredient you really need so don't waste your money on super expensive versions.Highly recommend."
7029,1,"Maybe, maybe not_After buying this product about a month ago I've been using it twice a day every day and I want to say that it works but I really can't tell. I'll still keep using it to see if it is really working or not"
4351,1,"I have eyebrows!!!_My eyebrows are starting to turn grey in some places so they are fading away.  I've never had great eyebrows so I really didn't want to lose what little I have.  I purchased this and I LOVE it!  It works great on eyebrows and it lasts quite awhile.  Definitely doesn't last a month, more like two weeks, but it's worth it to me to have my eyebrows back.  Oh and there is no reason to use the whole capsule for one application.  I get probably 4 applications out of each capsule so just go gently and you'll be able to figure out how much you need for your situation."
4202,1,Love them!_I am such a fan of travalo's. They have saved me many times from breaking a whole perfume bottle in my purse or suitcase. They are great for touch-ups when you feel that your perfume has worn off throughout the day.
4129,1,"Great Hydrating Makeup remover._For the price, this is a great makeup remover. I find it easier to apply using my fingers and rub it around for a bit to break up product. Because it's slick, there isn't a lot of tugging on the skin to damage or cause premature fine lines. However, it isn't unlike any other product on the market and isn't *exceptionally* hydrating. But it still works and I still like it, so 4/5 stars!"
3892,1,"Great for IBS C_All of these oils are great, and especially the lavender which smells and tastes excellent and is very calming.Still, I felt compelled to write about this peppermint oil because I read that it helps IBS C sufferers. In my case, it definitely worked and I felt the effects within an hour of consumption.I definitely recommend this is you're looking for natural alternatives to constipation.*** AS an added note: I find the orange oil works almost as well as the peppermint. Main thing is a tiny drop can be added to coffee and it really is good. It also works pretty fast!"
8431,1,"Really good mascara_I really like this mascara. It is a bit wet to start and takes extra time to build, but that's a very miniscule issue compared to the good things. If you're looking for a natural look, this is a good choice since it darkens and defines lashes in just one or 2 coats. It is buildable though for more dramatic looks. It doesn't clump, doesn't flake, doesn't give me raccoon eyes. In fact, it withstood me crying! I don't think it's a waterproof formula as it washed off pretty easily. It didn't give me any awful allergic reaction either. What it did give me was long, full, defined lashes. Overall, I'd definitely repurchase, especially for the price! I got mine at Target for $3 bucks. It's overpriced here on Amazon, but if Amazon drops the price below $3, Target will honor the price listed here! I say try it, it's a great product. It's not a huge investment if you end up not liking it."
4545,1,"I liked it personally_I bleached my hair to a golden blonde and it came out a peachy color. However once i toned my hair again and re applied the color was pretty and bright and thankfully pink. I didnt have any out of the shower bleeding thankfully. Color holds up pretty well for me (gotta love a demi) and when it did fade it went from a magenta looking pink, to bubble gum, to strawberry lemonade as my niece calls it."
4564,1,"good product_Weleda is my one of favorite brand, I would buy any product from them, because they have better practice in natural skincare products, I like this product, except price,  it's not too strong smell. I would buy again."
4158,1,Great_I love this product . It leaves a thick acrylic wrap on your nails n they grow ! Must have . Drys up fast though
8708,1,"Saw Results but used it Differently_I purchased this because I wanted a hair treatment since my hair started to feel dry and look a little frizzy only a couple weeks after my trip to the salon. I didn't want to go back to get a trim because it wasn't necessary so I started to look for damage repair treatments. I bought this after reading the label and the directions, I didn't have any reviews to go on since this was a new product and I'm happy I did.I have fine hair that doesn't hold a curl, barely holds a pony-tail holder and I need to readjust and tighten bobby pins frequently if I ever wear them. Basically I can only blow dry my hair straight with a round brush and call it a day, on top of that I have an oily scalp which inhibits my use of any products like mousse, serums and heat-protectors. My last trip to my stylist I really paid attention to what she did and started to mimic that at home, mostly blow-drying on hot (not warm) and because of this my hair started to feel drier more quickly.The directions say to use it after the total repair shampoo/conditioner, leave on for 3-5 minutes then rinse, I knew I wouldn't be able to follow this with my fine hair (plus I didn't buy the same shampoo/conditioner, I worshipYes To Carrots Scalp Relief Shampoo, 11.5 Fluid Ounce) so I decided to try it as an overnight treatment and that's where I saw my results. At night, before bed, I used about a nickel-sized amount, smoothed it into my hair mid-shaft to ends, gently combed it through then tied it into a loose pony tail with an ouchless elastic band and in the morning I did my routine as usual. It washed out and didn't leave residue or extra weight to my finicky hair.I started to see results after about three days, my hair was less frizzy and dry where I treated it and it looked a tad shinier as well so I started to inch up closer to my scalp and saw the same results. I still don't do my whole head for fear of causing an imbalance but I'm very happy with the results I have seen. It doesn't have an overpowering smell, it dissipates after a while and I've seen no damage to any pillows or any cloth products that have come in contact with my hair while the product is in it. Since I only use this at night and in such small amounts I suspect this could easily last me a year."
844,1,"Nummers!!_I really like this smell!  Before I bought this, I didn't usually wear perfume, but now, I make sure to always spritz some on!!  Smells like an adult version of toasted marshmallows!"
3465,0,"Poorly made_I purchased this two pack of wig caps and upon opening the package for the first time, both of the caps had holes in them. I would not recommend buying this product."
9196,1,"Almost perfect._For my combination dry and normal skin, this product was nothing short of a miracle. I honestly thought it was only a concealer, so I only used it as a concealer while I used liquid foundations. Operative word: different liquid foundations. I was on the hunt for the perfect one, but they all seemed to not work cause I still look super haggard and it looked like I wasn't wearing makeup at all.After accidentally coming up on a YouTube review for this foundation, I realized I can actually use it for the whole face. Lol.So I did and guess what? My search is over. It was with me all the while............the search is over.. it was right ..before my eyes...This one did major coverage without seeming fake, it wasnt as thin as the liquid foundations. It leaves a semi powdery residue YET it doesn't leave your face looking like its fully caked or anything. You might need to re-apply after 5-6 hours though.I use Maybelline primer before using this, by the way."
354,1,"A happy, not expected reaction... ;)_I had purchase a small tube of this a couple yrs back at &#34;Whole Foods&#34;. The 2oz tube was much more expensive THERE than this 4oz.!! I used it on & off then just forgot about it. After moving, I found the tube amount my things & decided to try it again. I am in my early 40's ( though I never admit it!)  & let's just say I'm noticing the affects of AGE on my body , lol. My &#34;monthly&#34; is all whacked out, it's either very heavy & lasts for 7-8 days, or spotty for just a few days! I get twice some months, oh what a joy.... ;(  So, figuring these symptoms, I thought maybe using this cream may help? Since we lose estrogen as we age, why not replace it, maybe it will reverse some of the issues of LOW estrogen! Well, I started using what I had left of my 2oz tube. Within about 2weeks I notice a weird feeling in my breast. Not only were they a lot more sensitive , as they were in my 20's, but they were..uummm... Bigger?? They had a feeling of fullness, I remembered them feeling like this in my teens & thru 20's just before I'd get my &#34;monthly&#34;. But I had not had that happen in a LONG time, especially after having my daughter 10 yrs ago. I had a full D cup, when I couldn't breast feed her, they quickly DEFLATED! I cried for only a few months, .. Now left with still a D cup yet instead of a FULL, I was now a LONG!! ;(  My only recourse has been the PUSH ( way) UP bra. I sleep in them! Well, anyway, this cream somehow was giving me a bit of my lost fullness back. Don't know how, why, don't care.. I quickly bought this 4oz tube off Amazon at a much cheaper price, as I have almost always found with everything- Go Amazon!  So,I put this on my...ummm.. Well, Breasts! Why put it on my arm or leg & wait for it to work it's way to the area I want it it affect?!  So alittle tweaking on my part w/directions- I use it 2x a day ( if I remember!) & apply it directly on my breasts. If it keeps doing what it's doing ( sensitive &full) I'll buy STOCK in the company!  Yea, I recommend it... ;)"
790,1,Shea moisture leave in_I thought this product was a bit pricey but I suffer from dry hair so I was willing to try it. This is my first time trying a shea moisture product and I am pleased. My hair felt so soft after using this and it continues to work almost 2 months later. This leave in also smells good. I will continue to buy this product.
7120,1,"Good stuff_Similar to Egyptian Magic (I can't tell the diff, except this is better priced), try Sweet Bee Magic.  Very good product.  Rather similar to a petroleum jelly, seals in moisture, but is organic and not a petroleum-based product."
2016,1,"Good blush at a good price!_My only complaint about CoverGirl Cheekers Blush is that it should be in a slightly larger container, so that I could pick up more product when I use my own blush brush. That being said, the pros most definitely outweigh that little problem. The color is excellent. I can use this blush and get a fresh, rosy glow without ending up with a clown face when the oils of my skin start reacting to it during the day. The application is perfection -- I don't have to constantly build to get any color saturation. It's just right!If you are looking for a new blush to add to your collection, but don't want to spend a lot to try something new, you can't go wrong with CoverGirl Cheekers Blush in Classic Pink."
2119,1,"So far it hasn't burned out._Usually when I buy these products from Conair and Revlon they die really, really quickly even if I am diligent about removing hair from the brush. Then you are left with half a head of dry hair, wait 10 minutes for it to start working again, and repeat. It can get very annoying. However, I have owned this product for a few months and it hasn't died on me yet, which is making me very, very happy. I would recommend this blow dryer over the others."
2351,1,Great item_Works very well for prepping and finishing gel nails. I used with my gelish products and am really satisfied with the lerformance
1860,0,Product was unsealed!!_I am so unhappy about this product.First of all it came in dirty package (There was a foot print on it Looks like someone stepped on it) very disgustingsecond product was unsealed!!Third I check it and it looked dryfourth I tried it on and it didn't give volume nor length.Fifth made my lashes clumpy so they ended up looking like little spider's legs!
4701,1,"Great product with great results_I have used Proactiv products before so I was familiar with the refining mask.  The ones that I recieved are all good and won't expire until 14 months from now so I am sure they will be used by then.  THe product works really well for me.  After I use the mask I can see a more even skin tone and reduced redness.  The mask also helps me prevent breakouts, and if I do breakout slightly I put a small dab of the mask on overnight for a spot treatment that works wonders.  I really love this product.  If you haven't tried this before I would suggest trying.  If you don't want 5 bottles at first try one and see how it works for you.  The pack of 5 is a great deal given the price that Proactiv charges."
3730,1,"AMAZING for acne prone skin!!_I live in Southern Arizona, aka the desert, aka the sun beats down on you nearly every day. I've been using sunscreen as a daily am moisturizer on and off for years now, but there were key things that were preventing me from using it on a regular basis. No matter how many sunscreen brands I turned to, they either made white streaks, my skin more oily/shiny, and broke me out! This has been an absolutely lifesaver, while my skin still gets oily, it doesn't break me out or flake or leave white streaks! Absolute lifesaver."
701,1,Fabulous._I purchased this for my destination wedding in Mexico this coming January. I've practiced with it a few times already and it seems to work great. It sets all your make-up and gave me the extra confidence that while getting married on the beach my face wont melt off in the process!I wore it for a whole day special event and fell asleep without washing my face (bad girl) and it all still looked pretty perfect in the morning. I'm happy!
6292,1,"Smells devine!_Does any product smell better than Chi? For me, next to the smell of the aroma oil Eucalyptus & Spearmint, the smell of chi is the best. I mix this with fractionated coconut oil and Jamaican Black Castor oil. Chi disguises the smell of the castor oil which is great for healing and maintaining healthy hairline but have an off-putting smell. I apply this mixture to my scalp and it is helps to keep my scalp and hair healthy."
5117,0,no improvement_i used this product as directed and had no real improvement in hair growth or quality. would not recommend buying such expensive vitamins
9911,1,"A Product To Love Cause It Works!_I love my PureSol Konjac Facial Sponge! Yes, I do! After using it for the first time, I am convinced that this sponge is one-of-a-kind, amazing product that actually works. I can definitely feel that my face is cleaner, brighter, and smoother after my initial use of this sponge. I also love that it's extremely soft and gentle, so I can actually use it everyday. I don't have to worry about harsh chemicals because this is 100% natural and eco-friendly. Oh, I also love the suction hook that came with the sponge. It made cleaning and drying it so much easier. Overall, I am really impressed and satisfied with this product!"
1438,1,it is great and smells very good_At $12 is a great expensive buy (this is why only 4 stars and not 5...because it is expensive). At $22 list price no way!
4470,1,painless and effective_i was intimidated by my kinky hair but i brought this brush and will be buying a few more. Great!!
5571,1,"My fave CND color so far_I got this color in a kit. Didn't think it would be a chart topper for me, I typically go for a deeper burgundyish red. But as it turns out I gave it a try and it looks fantastic on my pale skin. I think it will work well in any season. Classy.Applies super easily. I've used it twice now. Performs as promised."
7925,1,"Not just for babies_I've used several Cotz products now, and I find they are great for sensitive skin. Cotz uses zinc oxide--remember way back when, when lifeguards had white noses slathered with the stuff? My skin develops sensitivity to most sunscreens after a couple of months, but never with these products. Another big plus is that it never runs into my eyes when I work out in the summer--other sensitive skin products still sting a lot if they get into your eyes. The only negative is that it goes on thick and white in spots when you first apply it, but I find that waiting a few minutes and then rubbing it in again solves the problem. It's a good motivator for applying the sunscreen before going out, which is what the experts recommend anyway. This product is great for all ages."
8735,1,"Beautiful Shade_Brag brand, great colour! What more can I say? I will be buying this shade again. Particularly nice for summer wear, or cruising season."
7190,1,"It's a shower cap!_There is nothing special and as another reviewer said they are flimsy BUT I use them in the shower not for treatments just to keep my hair dry.  I'd like them a bit bigger and a bit sturdier sure, but the cost very little and they work well enough for me."
2556,1,"Nice and a bit different_I don't know why but I don't recall ever seeing these mesh scrubbies configured in this manner before.  This works nicely.  The mesh is soft but full, and it seems to be making even more lather from a small amount of soap than my regular, round mesh scrubbies do.  It's not as abrasive feeling as my round scrubbies, either, but it still seems to do a good job of washing.  The shape and handle etc. are all well done.  The mesh is laced onto a thin bar of the plastic handle which runs the entire length of the back area of the mesh section.  One thing about the handle that is particularly nice, besides the logical slight S curve in it, is that the part where you hold it is shaped to fit in the palm of your hand with some ridges to help hold onto it.I don't think this is what you want if you are looking for a really firm, stiff scrubber.  But if you want a nice, soft one that will work great to soap and wash you all over efficiently, this works great for that.There's no getting around the fact that mesh scrubbies generally have a bit of a garish look; however, I got the blue one and it really isn't as bad looking as I thought it would be.I'll also add that I think this is a nice, generous size; it's not dinky, it's not ridiculously huge, but it is what I would call a large washing brush.  That makes it very quick and efficient to use, since you can wash yourself completely without a lot of fiddling with re-soaping and scrubbing with a smaller brush or scrubbie that has much less actual surface area than this one does."
2855,0,WTF???_2 of them were broken when they got here.I wouldn't be so quick to order these from scunci they did not package properly and the broken product on arrival makes them absolutley useless to me...thanks a lot scunci.
3100,1,"Translucent is no joke!_After having such a hard time finding makeup that matched my face I was so excited to find this color. It actually ended up being a little too light for me. It worked great though and didn't seem to make my face as irritated as other powders/cover ups. I wear it alone as foundation and its perfect.BUT if you plan to travel with this makeup, prepare for a mess! Its not in the best container. That's important for me and the reason it's only 4 out of 5 stars."
8062,1,"Works great_Smells good, but not at all overpowering. I love that there are no harsh chemicals in this product. It has a lovely, moisturizing lather."
7141,1,"Love it!_Got this for my daughter's hair (she's half African American), and this works great for her hair. It's easy to spread, it's not as greasy as products with stuff like petrolium jelly in them. it softens her hair great!!!! I also bought the conditioner (that you rinse off after shampooing) and I'm really happy with how managable her hair is. Her hair is thin, but still has the &#34;fro&#34; going on..."
8243,1,"I love it!_I've been trying all the BB creams recently, I really liked L'OrealL'oreal Studio Secrets Magic BB Cream, Light, 1 Fluid Ounce, but decided to purchase MaybellineMaybelline Dream Fresh BB Cream Medium 1.0 Fl ozsince it had SPF also. The L'oreal BB does feel very light, but I attribute that to the lack of sunscreen. On the whole any sunscreen in a product will feel a bit heavier, but it's a must so I live with it.  I'm a beauty junkie while also going for the 'natural' look most of the time. I'm good with mascara, sunscreen(even in the rain and snow!) lip tint and cream blush. I liked the idea of adding a BB cream since I can always use some extra coverage love now getting to the ripe age of 32. Plus I'm lazy and like that it mixes together moisturizer, light coverage and SPF.  I got the Hydroxatone BB cream in Tan. I usually go towards the fair/light but found my Maybelline to be a little too light, especially in the summer. This 'tan' is a smidge dark on me, but it helps on the whole so I don't look so pale in the winter, so I'll probably use it year round! I have freckles I hate(sun damage in my book) but in the past have always found trying to cover them, it's too apparently I've 'tried' and not succeeded. With this, I don't have that problem. I actually had a friend ask where my freckles had gone, thinking I'd done something more extreme.  This Hydroxatone BB cream goes on very smoothly and it's pretty much foolproof! A couple of swipes around, using it like you would a moisturizer - and you're done! I'm picky about what I'm willing to splurge on, but I'd definitely purchase this."
2799,1,"Such a Smooth Feeling!_I love to shower with this body wash.  It makes my skin feels so soft.  I feel clean and fresh! I am very satisfied.Guess, what, I updated my comments on 10/9/2013:I decided to use both the Olay 2-In-1 Advanced Ribbons Soothing Cr&egrave;me + Advanced Moisture Body Wash 18 Oz (Pack of 3) with the 'Dove Visible Care Cr&egrave;me Body Wash'. The experience was both revitalizing, invigorating and rejuvenating.Also, when 'I bathe, I find that I do Not leave a dirty, bathtub ring!' I'm sold, ring it up and get it to me quickly.  They work fabulously together."
1747,1,"Oh thank goodness_Sing hallelujah! Over the past three years I've gradually become sensitized not only to chemical sunscreens but also to creams containing only physical sunblocks as active ingredients (Neutrogena Baby Free and Clear, California Baby Super Sensitive, Eucerin for Sensitive Skin). I was at my wit's end and Vanicream was the last thing I could think of to try. It doesn't sting and burn my face! I am so relieved.An extra plus is that, like other reviewers mentioned, it doesn't sting eyes, so I can rub it right up to my lower lashline and put it on my eyelids if I so desire. I also really like that it doesn't leave a white cast. It leaves a very shiny surface behind, that's true, but shiny is much easier to cover than white! I've found loose powder to do an excellent job of covering it up and creating a nice, longlasting, dewy and even look. I use Coty Air Spun but probably any decent loose powder would do; swirl it on with a kabuki brush. My skin has stayed fairly matte for up to four hours with one application of powder; it really clings to the film the sunscreen leaves behind."
9364,1,"Great for Cuticles_I haven't had a manicure since last year, and my cuticles were getting out of control, so I decided to use this on it, and in under a week, they just magically disappeared. You'd think I got frequent manicures if you saw my nails. I use it on my chapped lips too, and it works great!I did try it on my naturally curly hair, and I didn't notice much difference, but I already use a lot of oils, so I can see why it probably on't make much of a difference.I also noticed a lot of people are complaining about the smell, and it easily disperses. I believe it goes away in less than 2 minutes, plus the smell of unrefined shea butter is worse, so I guess that's why it doesn't bother me as much."
67,1,Great toner_I used the toner today after doing an at home facial and OMG it smells good first of all.  I didn't expect that because I never thought to smell it once it arrived.  It goes on soothingly and refreshes the skin.  I'm glad I purchased this product.
2494,1,Love it._Use this (and the shampoo) and have used it for years.  Get the large size and it will last your for a very long time.
4436,0,"Does nothing_I am working on growing my hair out and was told to use a more natural shampoo and conditioner.  I bought this because of the great price for the size.I DO NOT like this product.  My hair looked aweful!  The first few uses were okay.  This shampoo doesn't lather and the conditiner is very thin, but that didn't bother me.  I was told that my hair needed time to adapt to the product, but the longer I used it the worse my hair got.  My hair was very oily and frizzy at the same time.  I tried shampooing multiple times and only applying the conditioner to my ends, but that didn't help the situation at all.I stopped using this product and wont use it again."
7329,1,"Beautiful, pigmented colors, cheap packaging_The colors are really pretty and they are said to be dupes for MAC shadows. The packaging is really cheap though and the shadows themselves are very soft, so they are rather powdery and they can also break easily. But you can buy this cheaply at the drugstore. I'd say it's worth it."
477,1,Great Little Brush_The nice thing about this brush is the small brush tips allow you to clean the shed hair out of the brush easily. The brush feels sturdy and is easy to hold in your hand. A good buy that should last a long time.
4967,1,"The best of the Ponds cleansing towelettes_I use a towelettes every evening before bed and have tried several brands.  I have also tried the different types of Ponds, but find the Evening Soothe item the very best.  Certainly not the most expensive on the market,but I find them the very best.  I used to buy them with my weekly grocery order and inverably discovered that they were out of the Evening Soothe - always a good sign of a popular item.  Anyway, I was delighted to see that they are available from subscribe and save."
4365,1,"We fill soap dispensers and even the soap foam pumps with this type of soap,  a great way to save money!_We purchase these larger refill bottles to refill the smaller soap dispensers that we have throughout our home.  We also use this in the foaming dispensers.  In a foaming dispenser we put in about 15 to 20 percent of the bottle's volume with this soap and slowly add warm water to fill the bottle.  Screw on the pump and shake the bottle to mix the soap and then it pumps perfectly.  You have to use water in a foam pump as the soap is too viscous to pump and foam in those type of dispensers.You can fill these bottles for pennies instead of buying a whole new pumping foamer and have the same quality of cleanliness as you had with the original soap/foamer purchase.  This is a good buy and this size of bottle will last a long time.  It is a great way to save money and still use the brand and fragrance of soap you want to use at a lower cost.  We use this in the bathrooms, kitchens and even at the soak sink in the garage.  With seven sinks in the home this saves a lot of money.  This bottle is good for 800 dispenses of pure soap and in a foam dispenser you can get thousands when you mix in the water.  I posted a photo of the bottle for your information."
7562,1,"awsome_these stamping plates are really fun. there are some really nice designs, but there are some that I would never use. takes some practice to know how to use it."
9464,1,"Good purchase_This item has a little grainy texture . A pale color and a little , tolerable sent . I used it to rub my skin. It is heavy ,but still it gave me a smooth skin."
9019,1,Impressed_This was pleasing to the eyes for the fact that the presentation is so pretty. Different from the other plates I have collected which usually just come wrapped in plastic. The designs are very pretty on each and every plate. I wasn't going to purchase any more plates but when I saw someone reviewing this collection on YouTube I caved in and got them. Didn't have any problems with my order and I checked all the plates.
7353,0,"Shipped from HongKong!!!_And will take forever to get this product!  I could not see anywhere in the writeup that  was obvious to the unsuspecting buyer that it's being shipped from HongKong!  I bought this last week and the shipping says I will receive it between 6-2-14 and 6-19-14!!!!  What a deal! YeahRight.  So buyers beware, you won't get this product for a while.  It's already taking too long for my liking....and I still have a ways to go to get it!  What a scam!"
7365,1,"perfect color_I love love love how this color contrasts against my pale skin. Even my boyfriend said he liked it!  It has subtle shimmer in it, but it's barely noticeable. I tend to avoid shimmer, so that's how subtle it is. Perfect summer color!!!"
8104,1,"Works Well As Does the Sport Coolzone By Banana Boat._I tried both the Banana Boat Sport Coolzone and Protect and Hydrate SPF-30 sunscreens. I liked them both but found subtle differences between the two.The Protect and Hydrate has a bit more of a scent that the Coolzone and smells more like an aloe moisturizing lotion than a sunscreen (if I want to smell like the beach  I will have to look elsewhere.) It is a pleasant scent and would be fine to use anywhere.It lasts a long time and seems to make my skin feel nicer than the Coolzone. I took a quick look at the ingredients in this and the Coolzone and the Protect & Hydrate seems to have mineral oil and the Coolzone looks like it does not. I assume there are more and/or higher amounts of soothing ingredients  in the Protect and Hydrate as opposed to the Coolzone.I used this at a pool party.  It seem to last after I got out of the pool but I put a little more on just to be on the safe side.The Sport  Coolzone has a very mild scent. I have used Banana Boat products for years and associate them with vacations and beaches, in part, because of a pleasant sunscreen smell. This has scent that was barely noticeable and is great if I am going to party in someone's backyard where  I don't want smell like I am getting ready to got to the beach. It would also be great for sport type events as well (hence the name).It absorbed pretty quickly when I put it on my skin. Sunscreen has gotten so much better over the years. It used to greasy and now it is not. It also felt fine on my skin as well.Most importantly it seems to work and last. I was at an outdoor picnic/craft fair and I put this on at noon and did not put it on again until dinner time.  This goes against the instructions which suggest using every two hours. I did not get any sunburn.I like both products. Both protected my skin. I would use both for any outdoor activities. The Sport Coolzone has less of a noticeable scent for me.  The Protect & Hydrate makes my skin feel nicer and has an aloe like scent."
254,1,"Great stuff_I use this for washing dishes, vegetables, as a bubble bath, washing my hair....I could go on and on.  A bit expensive but worth it.  Love that it is all natural.  Almond is my favorite scent."
1809,1,another item of which I should've bought two_I really love this; I can use it for everything. I even put a little in the bath sometimes. a little goes a long way and it makes my skin and hair softer and smoother.
8912,1,Smooth plus nice color_This NYX Butter Lip Gloss goes on very smoothly .  The color is flattering to my pale warm toned complexion.  I recommend it.
9527,1,"Smells divine, works great_I'm honestly not someone who usually cares about conditioners. I've found most of them to be pretty much the same, and buy whatever's on sale most of the time.However, this one was a pleasant surprise for a number of reasons:  First and foremost, it's not heavy -- and thank heavens. Most conditioners I find to be way too heavy, but I suffer through them because I want my long hair to be well conditioned and strong. However, with Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Awapuhi Ginger and Honeysuckle leave-in conditioner, I love the fact that the texture is so light and oil-free. Blow-dry your hair after application and it just disappears, but with a noticeable shine.The scent is also divine -- it's not quite honeysuckle to me (it's my favorite scent so I tend to be a tough critic) but it's light and floral and very nice.  When I used the leave-in conditioner even in just a week, I had friends and strangers compliment me and ask about my hair.The best thing I can end with is that I already bought a replacement. It's worth keeping around if you have long or thick hair and value great conditioning, light feel, and beautiful scent."
3519,0,"Not as good as their original conditioner_I love the Moroccan Oil treatment that you put in your hair before blow drying as well as their shampoo and conditioner.  They are some of the best hair products I have ever used.  However, I was not impressed with the restorative treatment.  I have used their standard conditioning treatment and like it much better.  Like I said, the Moroccan Oil Products have been amazingly fabulous, and I would HIGHLY recommend them to everyone.  It's just that this particular one I found to be disappointing."
6192,1,"Used this in Oil Cleansing Method_I recently began using the oil cleansing method in my skincare regimen and chose this as my oil because it is antibacterial, doesn't clog pores, and moisturizes. It smells really bad, but it's not like you're slathering that stuff on your face as a mask, so it doesn't bother me at all. I use it at night before bed. It removes excess makeup hiding in your skin also.Since using this every night to cleanse before bed, my skin has become smoother, more moisturized (even in this ridiculous winter with my typically dehydrated skin), and most importantly--has MUCH more even coloring. I break out less and my skin looks healthier and more lifted/plump.I'll be repurchasing, definitely."
8342,1,"Axe face wash_I TESTED SEVERAL DIFFERENT AXE PRODUCTS BUT AM ONLY ALLOWED TO POST ONE REVIEW FOR THE 'FAMILY OF PRODUCTS' SO I'M COMBINING ALL MY THOUGHTS HEREEnergizing Boost:  I couldn't put my finger on the scent at first.  I thought incense, cinnamon, saffron?  But finally I decided it smelled like Earl Grey tea.  Nothing wrong with that-just not what I expected. I guess that unexpectedness is what is supposed to make it 'energizing'.  A small amount of gel produces a decent amount of lather.  The gel contains a sparse amount of 'micro beads' that I think could have easily been omitted from the formula.  Doesn't seem like there are enough of them to provide any derm-abrasion action. The lather rinses off with no residue and left my skin feeling clean but not irritated or dried out.  A little pricy to use as an all-over body wash but a good choice as a face wash.Cooling Face Wash, Chilled:  This is a more traditional product both in scent and that it doesn't have any new fangled micro beads.  I left it on long enough to 'feel the chill' and I wouldn't recommend that because my face felt a little dry and tight afterwards.  This seems to have some sort of astringent to it and would be better for occasional use than everyday.Oily skin face scrub:  Lots of microbeads for deep, exfoliating clean.  Fresh scent, rinsed clean.Foaming Face Wash:  This one dispenses as a foam- kind of pre-lathered.  It seems more gentle than the gel-style Axe face washes I tested.  It took a lot of water to feel like the product was actually rinsed off.  I think it must have a moisturizer included that is supposed to leave a residue behind as a skin conditioner.  This would be a nice choice for sensitive skin & daily use."
6093,1,"Had to have it!_I first sampled this product from a Beauty Test Tube.  I loved how soft and conditioned my hair felt!  I don't have color-treated hair, but it still keeps my hair feeling supple and soft with each use."
6677,1,"leaves skin feeling soft_Being a wee bit on the pale side (seriously if I don't hear the words 'you look a bit pale' at least once a week...), sunscreen is a must. Hawaiian Tropic Silk goes on very easily, absorbing quickly and leaving the skin feeling nice and silky (as advertised) without any sticky or greasy residue.  There's a definite coconuty/flowery scent when you put it on, but it does fade away a bit (guys may be happy to hear that).  The sunscreen holds up decently to normal conditions - the biggest selling point to this lotion is that it does leave your skin feeling great while protecting it.  The faint fragrance is an added bonus, unless that's something you'd rather avoid (due to allergies/sensitivities or preferring not to smell vaguely like flowers and coconuts)."
1775,1,"Works great_I used this toner every time I wash my face, and am very happy with the results. This is my third bottle."
9210,1,Beautiful_I was looking to make my nails a black pearl color and this was exactly what I was looking for. I have recieved a lot of compliments and really love this color.
2642,1,Love it_This is a very nice looking mirror that I can leave on my bathroom counter. I like the fact that it has a magnified side to it.
1949,1,"Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Deep Pore Cleaning, 1 Pound_Great mask I mix this with another great product ( Braggs A.C.V.) it stinks but does wonders for my skin. I notice that it cleans and buffs my skin from impurities and if I have a break out it sucks them to the surface for easy removal gross I know but also pretty cool if you need to get rid of those little bastards fast and furious :)"
7264,1,"Great brush for foundation application_I purchased this brush after reading so many positive reviews.  I have to agree with others that tis brush is very good for foundation application.  I used to use flat foundation brushes, but this one is much better.  It is a soft brush and makeup goes on smoothly.  After seeing some complaint about streaking, I realized that in order for the brush not to streak, it must be cleaned very frequently.  I have a brush cleaner, but mainly clean it with shampoo.  I use it daily and it does a great job!  I highly recommend it!"
8521,1,"Works well - smells great!_Both my husband and I had tried Dove Men+Care Sensitive Scalp Fortifying 2 in 1 because of our different lengths of hair. We both have very fine hair. His opinion is 'It works but smells like deodorant'. It's true, it smells like a sports scent - which isn't a bad thing. He doesn't mind it and I think it smells really nice. It leaves his hair soft and he doesn't seem to have problem with static (which is a huge problem this time of the year).For long hair (almost mid-back), I found that the Dove worked nicely. I didn't use conditioner but just the product and didn't find static to be an issue. It left my hair soft, quite manageable and didn't get greasy quickly like many of the conditioning type of shampoos do. If it wasn't for the manly smell, I'd be using this shampoo regularly myself.I like the container design - no messy dispensing and easy to hold/grip. It's easy to toss in your bag, fits nicely on a shower shelf as well as a shower caddy.Recommended."
2380,1,"so far, so good_My 17 year old son tried this and has used it for a week. So far, so good.His face is fresher and exfoliated and so far, it seems to work. He's had acne and has had prescription treatment for it. This is helping with only minor breakouts that have recurred after several years.Will update with new info later."
6754,1,Greatness has arrived_LOVE LOVE LOVE it! Best neutral pallet I have ever bought. All the right colors. Pigmentation is ok on some of the matte but the shimmers are awesome! love it highly recommended.
1660,0,"contains protein, so try with caution; hair may become dry_If paired with matching conditioner, your hair may become dry and hard to manage due to protein sensitivity or protein overload. Both the shampoo and the conditioner have protein, which can cause your hair to feel dry and not soft. This brand of haircare products do have the same ingredients that other commercial brands have, and only a few of products that are not harmful and artificial.  You'll know whether or not this is true when you read and investigate the ingredients, and maybe test the organix products for yourself. I had purchased together the coconut milk shampoo and conditioner from a drugstore about three years ago, and because of my dissatisfaction of these products, I still have them. I did like the conditioner more because of the slip factor it gave my hair after the stiffness my hair had after I had used the shampoo.  So, now in hopes of using it up, I either use the shampoo or the conditioner as the only protein product I put on my hair while cleansing my hair with other brand of hair products that don't contain protein.  I had also informed the organix company of my dissatisfaction but no response on their part.  I say if you desire to try this brand or any brand of haircare, know your hair--what its needs are and how it responds to the ingredients in products.  Taking this step can ensure and empower you with the knowledge you need as a consumer so you won't be duped by so many companies that try to lure you in with commercials, pop culture and lies."
2915,1,"Lathers and cleans well, light scent - love it_Any soap that lathers well is off to a good start, as far as I'm concerned. This one also manages not to dry my skin, which is a huge plus, especially in the brutal northeast winter we've had this year. I like the very light scent. It makes me feel clean without feeling like I've been &#34;scrubbed.&#34; Good stuff!"
1039,1,Just as described_This eyebrow kit is perfect. The stencils are gorgeous and the brow powder is semi permanent which is always a plus. Definitely recommend this eyebrow kit.
4633,1,great stuff..I love this stuff. If you can only get over the appearance.._I always give natural black soap a five star. great stuff.. Its good stuff...I would buy it again.. You should too.
9132,1,"Great affordable product_I don't wear a whole lot of makeup any more (did in my younger days), but I love this BB+ cream.  And the fact that it doesn't cost three arms and two legs (like many BB creams I've seen) makes it fantastic.I love the medium shade, just perfect for my skin.  The cream doesn't cause any irritation to my facial skin and actually smooths out many of the imperfections.  So for me, this means that this will be a product on my make-up table from now on.While I wouldn't recommend this shade to those who have very fair skin, I can find nothing wrong with this affordable product."
6899,1,Nice guy shampoo_This works great for my son who has curly hair. It smell nice and makes it easy to manage. I would recommend it to any guys you know.
9398,1,"Gentle on Skin_I have combination skin, that is sensitive.  The Nature's Best Vitamin C Serum arrived very quickly from Amazon.com.  It came packaged well in a glass bottle with a glass dropper.  At first I noticed the dropper was flat on the bottom, compared to other ones that have a pointed tip. After trying it, it actually allows for precision application.I have been using Nature's Best Vitamin C Serum for 1 week now and I am very pleased with the results. My skin is softer and my skin tone is more even.  I do not have those rough dry patches that I experienced before use.  I also noticed that the oily areas I usually have around my nose are gone too.  Overall I am very pleased with the results so far."
1428,1,"I love these!_I have 3 of them and Im so hooked. I'm for sure buying more. I use a primer underneath and they stay on all day without creasing. They are an amazing base under eyeshadows! They are really soft, creamy, and pigmented!"
3851,1,"NYX Cosmetics Powder Blush Peach_This is a great summer color, nice peachy cheeks and you will be good to go.  I do like putting a little vaseline first and then the powder blush.  I think it stays on longer.  This was wrapped well, delievered to the door with free shipping.  I am very happy with this seller and will buy from the seller again."
1409,1,"From the sea to my bath_This was part of a 'bath set' gift I got for my wife for her birthday.  A natural sea sponge is a bit of a luxury, but I figured birthday's should be all about luxury.My wife is thrilled with this, which makes me happy. This was her (and mine) first natural sea sponge, so I don't have much to compare it to other than the synthetic types.  It is soft!  I was surprised at how soft it is!  Much, much softer than synthetic sponges I have used.  It feels great in the shower, builds up a good lather, and soaks up water.  I thought it was a good size (about the size of a grapefruit)--there is some shrinkage when it gets wet, but I thought it was workable.It looks nice too.  I like how it retains its shape, and wasn't cut down into a ball or something.  It is a natural sea sponge after all! I want it to look like one.We have only been using it for a couple of weeks, so I hope the goodness lasts. I've seen some reviews that natural sponges don't last all that long. Seeing how happy my wife is with this, something tells me if it falls apart I will be buying her a replacement!"
2057,1,"Wiz of a product_amazing product.  I have no eyebrows due to chemo.  this draws  nice hair like strokes, and doesn't smudge.  It stays put, and looks very natural"
8404,1,If you've only ever had plastic ones in the past - you will kick yourself after you use this one with metal teeth._It's not that expensive & it far exceeded my expectations - the metal teeth on the comb don't come anywhere close to comparing with the typical plastic ones I've always had (and paid more for). this is definitely in a whole different league of cosmetic tools. Get it - seriously - just get it! You're worth it!!
1651,1,"Great conditioner!_I bought this, along with the Silicon Mix leave-in to use on my young daughter.This product is great. It really softens her hair.I shampoo her, then use this with a plastic cap on her head for longer than the recommended time (about 15 minutes).I think it's a good product."
1634,1,"Perfect tool!_I love this product!!! It works perfect!!!! Easy to use and light weight. No instruction comes with the product. But it is no problem., You will figure out how to use it easily. Highly recommended!"
6412,1,much more purple than expected_Upon use it became evident that this lipstick is very purple. It is grey-lavender. This is totally fine with me. It also does not stay on very long. Despite this...I LOVE IT! My boyfriend saw it on my wishlist and got it for me. It looks spectacular. It is a completely unique color!
2139,1,"The Best_This is by far my favourite hair care product. I love the way it smells and it's the only leave-in conditioner that really works for me. Over the years, I've tried other brands when this has been out of stock and they don't compare. My hair is long and dry and requires a lot of extra moisture that this leave-in provides. If it weren't for this stuff, I probably couldn't comb my hair, honestly. I was saddened when they retired it but later learned they had just changed it to be part of the Touchably Smooth line, although it makes me very pleased to find the original is still available right here on Amazon! Definitely buy! Everyone will tell you how wonderful your hair smells."
7482,1,"Very Good Conditioner_Before I get into the merits of this product, Amazon needs to ship it more carefully in the future. The bottle opens from the bottom, and my bottle spilled into the packaging. I'm all for easy-to-open products, but in this case it would be wise to use a small strip of tape to seal the container.Despite this concern, I found the conditioner to be very good. It made my hair easier to comb through when it was wet. It also has a nice scent, and my hair, when dry, looked healthy and shiny.I'm still a fan of Pantene, but this is not a bad conditioner."
9715,1,"DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS DEAL_These are comparable to my high quality MAC brushes. no lie!, I love to use them with both powders and creams!! The Seller is awesome, and followed up with a personal email to make sure I received the product in a promptly manner. They were genuine  and really nice, I can't wait to order more from the seller. I will be going to a makeup seminar soon ONO beauty school with pricilla ono and i will def be taking these brushes with me"
9378,1,"Love it_I have been using this for approximately a month and have noticed a definite thickening in my hair. I also noticed that when I take showers, there are less fallout a going down the drain!!"
4976,0,"I really wanted to like this_Okay, despite the bad reviews mixed in, I wanted to give this stuff a shot. Sulfur is really good for dealing with breakouts, and I was hoping that maybe this would be a step up from the mask I use.After very long debate, I ordered this and it arrived just in time to be tested at the tail end of my... hormonal time of the month. I had one large pimple, and this was effective at drying it out. The rest is pretty bad.When I applied it to the pimple, I also applied it to the area surrounding it. It shrank the size of the pimple I had, but cause a PAINFUL red lump under the skin next to it. I also applied this to a tiny white head in a different location. In theory it was so small I could have just scratched off with my nail if I were so inclined. Very tiny. It, too, turned very red, very painful, and inflamed to more than twice the original size!This can't be. I applied more to the red lump it caused, just to see, trying to give it the benefit of the doubt, and it went down. At that point, I'm kind of like... well maybe I shouldn't give up just yet. Some days later,  I applied it just to an area prone to clogged pores. (Oh, I'm a daredevil.) Yet again, I ended up with a large, painful red lump under my skin. Only this time, the sulfur ointment did nothing to decrease the size, but instead made it bigger when I used it again!I'm glad that some people have found this useful, but it's a bust for me. I was skeptical with this being in grease form, but took the risk. Now I know I wasn't missing anything good! If you do try this, the grittiness isn't *that* bad. It's sort of like A&D; ointment with a little baking soda mixed in as far as texture is concerned. I also wouldn't recommend smearing this over large areas of skin until you know if you can tolerate it. The smell wasn't too bad. If you're used to cleaning silver with a vinegar and baking soda solution, it's no where near that strong in odor. The scent is tolerable, and even though it's a small container, you don't need to use much of it for spot treatments.For me, personally, the terrible side effects outweigh the minimal usefulness."
277,0,"wish i hadn't wasted money on it_when i brought this i was originally looking for something to spay in my hair every day but i decided to get this instead it really doesn't do anything for my hair and yes i followed the directions and applied heat to my hair after i washed it but i could live without it. i really dont see what it's doing and i've tried it a couple of times...so yeah, but the chi keratin mist does wonders for my hair i love that product but this i wish i could return it but i already used it"
322,1,Swear By This...For Years!_I have been using the product for at least five years and it really has kept my skin in tip top shape. It smells so good and really does moisturize and lock in the hydrating power of your moisturizer. Just something to freshen the skin and add to your beauty arsenal as a must have staple. Perfect!
7100,1,"Gentle enough for first time users, but with results_I used this hesitantly because its TCA. After following the directions, I was pleased with the results, minimal peeling. I would say that the solution is likely buffered and not close the same as an in office peel. However; with regular use, it could be a great maintenance program."
9459,1,"2 weeks in- love love love this._As I'm getting older I've noticed those horrific lines around me eyes.  Unfortunately I've neglected my skin for the last 30 years.  Since I received the anti-aging cream, I've used it every day, twice a day for 2 weeks and I can certainly tell a difference in the elasticity in the skin around my eyes.  My dark circles are also less noticeable and my eyes look brighter.  I will continue to use this cream!"
5020,1,"Great!_I ordered this when I ordered the Olay Pro-x and the brush heads last super long, they work great for my sensitive skin!"
9830,1,Wonderful set of travel brushes_Wonderful set of travel brushes.  Stylish and enclosed in a fabulous leopard print case that has a chunky gold zipper pull.
7520,1,"Great stuff!_I'm very happy with this product! I use two coats before and two after color. I just make sure I rough up the nail before the base coat and the nails last for a very long time (3 weeks at the least). Good size bottles too, not the little tiny ones."
444,0,"NEW FORMULA NOT GOOD_I loved Atopalm. It was a rich fragrance free moisturizer that I could use on my entire body, including my face. The company changed the formulation in 2010, basically removing the parabens and adding fragrance. This made a huge difference to the efficacy of the product. It is no longer a rich emollient cream. It is now like many other drugstore moisturizers. And because my facial skin is very sensitive, the fragrance (although very subtle) STINGS my skin. I'll use the jar I have for my family (who it does not bother), but won't be buying again. Very disappointing."
164,1,"You had me at 'rose'! A lovely, effective moisturizing lotion._I'm a sucker for anything rose-scented, especially body products. I eyed this Rose Milk Skin Care Loton for a very, very long time before I finally thought 'what are you waiting for?' and ordered it. I must mention that have no nostalgia tied to the product, no memories of my mother or grandmother smelling of its elegance-by-association with as they kissed me goodnight.So, with no pre-set expectations, I opened it immediately (even as other family members were clamoring for their part of the order) and breathed it in: a powdery, true rose scent, almost old-fashioned somehow. Just the way I like it. I let out two sighs, one of relief, and one of delight.I've first I applied it a few times to my hands and arms, and later my body's shoulders, d&eacute;colletage, legs, and feet.My reactions:1) This is far more moisturizing than I expected! Many perfumed lotions will wind up only drying you out (Bath & Body Works, for example, has never satisfied my skin. And I only use one kind: Pink Peony, because it includes notes of rose.)a) The alcohol content of Rose Milk is not specified, but it does come towards the middle of the ingredients list, meaning the prime ingredients are: water, mineral oil, and glycerin, before the various types of alcohol start popping up.)(Comparatively, my B&BW; list reads water, glycerin, petrolatum, and then cetyl alcohol launched the longer list of ingredients.)b)  Maybe that mineral oil is giving it some staying power? All I know is, my skin feels so good, and I won't be reaching for the bottle again and again. That's a relief.2) The rose scent is light indeed. I'm not slipping into a silky peignoir made of rose petals, to be sure. But I won't be overwhelming innocent souls who must work next me to or sleep beside me. It's my personal fragrance in my personal space. I like that.A) This stuff does NOT smell like grannies! Despite the nostalgia factor for some, as someone whose grandmothers did not use t, I do not associate it with little old ladies at all, except that I think it would be a wonderful, useful, well-enjoyed gift for Nanas everywhere. :)3) The lotion is creamy enough for a little to go a long way. A dime-sized amount is enough the moisturize both my hands and arms.4) I'm noticing the fragrance seems buildable, perhaps. Apply in layers to carefully strengthen the scent!5) I have but one complaint: this is not a pump bottle nor does it have a snap cap. A loose cap is a challenge, no matter who you are, no matter how old you are. It can easily be knocked off the dresser or bedside and could roll out of reach under furniture. If there are dogs or children around, yikes! Danger! It's quite, quite frustrating, as I have a tough-luck history with such things (no, not children and dogs, but runaway caps.)Ultimately, I had to take away a star (I wish I could only dock it a half star) for the loose-bottle-top issue.But otherwise, this Rose Milk is a romantic, soothing, skin softening treat and and excellent value over luxury brands I haven't even mentioned."
3374,1,"Keeps my sensitive face clear!!!_This is great for people who have sensitive skin, while also being acne prone. It has a slight smell to it, but it is very subtle. While is has sacylic acid in it, I personally have not had any issues with it over drying my skin. Any acne product typically has the sacylic to dry out the blemishes. This line contains the face wash, the moisturizer, and the acne spot treatment for blemishes."
1327,1,"Great for international travel to 3rd world countries_Did you know that 90% of your immune suystem is in your 'gut'?Two TRUE STORIES that I experienced firsthand with Florastor:1) We were in the Amazon jungle and I opened my mouth while bathing with river water. The next day my bowels were in an uproar and I was bent over with cramps.  Fortunately, two doctors in our group had brought some Florastor with them and they began dosing me.  It took about 48 hours (and some strong oregano and lemongrass teas) but I was much improved. These doctors(from New Zealand) told me they took Florastor while they traveled around the world and they never had experienced bowel troubles.2)  Not long ago we were in Guatemala and one of my teen travelers was hit with severe vomiting.  She was rushed to an ER where she was put on IV and given a drink mixed with--you guessed it--Florastor.  The doctor wrote a 'prescription' for 10 days of Florastor to get her fully recovered.It is my understanding that in many countries Florastor is actually prescribed by doctors to fix/prevent intestinal ailments.Now I never travel without it."
8940,1,"It works_This product works, I tried everything for days to clear a blemish that appeared on my face, and ordered this as a last resort.  It worked overnight. It didn't effect the surrounding area around my blemish like the other items did, its a must have. Buy it and try it yourself, you wont be disappointed."
8802,1,Elegance_These nail art pieces has given my nails the look of elegance along with other pieces or just by themselves.
8881,1,Awesome purple color_This color is great and I can't wait to use it.  It is a great light purple shade and will be great for the spring and summer months.  I have a lot of OPI purple colors and this will work for the times I want a lighter shade.
9983,1,"Blends well and makes the circles go away fast!_This is not like a concealer...this actually make the dark circles and puffiness become less noticeable, Very good product and I love that it does not sting or burn my eyes since it has to be applied close to them. I also love that it doesn't have a strong smell. I use this all the time. Its the one I grab first!"
7980,1,"This is better!_This is the second brand of Hyaluronic Acid Serum I've tried, and I like this one much better.I use it at night after I wash my face, and in the morning under my make-up, with just a dabof moisturizer."
6106,1,"Mask_This product is fantastic. After only three days I felt my skin texture transform from tissue paper to copy paper. It feels much denser and firmer. I am 62 years old and if my skin can get such immediate results anyone's can. I use the mask, cleanser, toner and moisturizer. I highly reccommend this product. Some may feel it is pricey, but I assure you, you will get your money's worth. In fact I feel it will save me money. Try it, you have nothing to loose but signs of aging. My name is Bernadine Dunaway and I am not getting paid to say this. I only review products I truly beleive in and am very satisified with. NOBODY can pay me to say something they want you to hear."
1049,0,"Horrible! Unnatural (and Damaging too)_I don't write a ton of negative reviews, but I had to chime in here. I found this product to be an absolute disaster.I've been coloring my hair in the blonde auburn/light red spectrum over the counter for twenty years or more. Seriously, since I was 16. I'm not shy about it -- it looks really natural, so it never bothers me to admit to people that I color it. And I've rarely had a problem -- my hair is thick and strong (not fine, darn it), but it really takes to red colors and it almost always looks very natural, from Loreal to Clairol (colors change or discontinue so occasionally I try out other brands).But WOW. I was incredibly disappointed with this purchase. I didn't just dislike the result, I hated it. While some reds can end up looking a little magenta the next day, if you follow the directions and rinse well, conditioning diligently afterward, within a day or two the color calms down and looks great. Like I said, I've been doing this for 20 years. Not here. I ended up with nuclear Chernobyl-red-purple results that weren't just utterly unnatural, they were uneven (which never happens with me -- as someone with longer hair, I always use two boxes for even coverage for just this reason, and my hair is in great condition).But for the first time ever, my results were so embarrassingly bad, I wore a hat when I left the house. First time ever in my life.  And the dyeing experience itself here was frustrating and messy -- the Garnier Nutrisse color includes this ridiculous 'fruit concentrate' first, off, that is just this oil substance that you add to the haircolor. The result has NO effect on the scent of the haircolor or on your hair's conditioning. What it does do is instantly turn the mild inconvenience of haircoloring into a nightmare you will be rinsing away for weeks.  The oil is unpleasant and turns the standard haircoloring experience into a nightmare that is suddenly a sodden oily mess that resists rinsing!Not only that but the resulting haircolor in my case went from 20 years of very even, pretty reds (seriously, I have never encountered anything like this) to an ugly and unnatural purple-ish red that kind of resembled Kool-Aid dye jobs, but not evenly -- instead, it was 'patchy' nasty purple-red that was patchy and uneven, unnatural-looking, and unattractive. I was in tears afterward and despite weeks of attempting to wash away the horrible residue, my hair was still rinsing with purple tints two weeks later despite daily washes to try to tame the results.I will never use this color again and am once again returning to Loreal Excellence/Preference reds, where I never encountered ANYTHING like this. If you're unsure about coloring your hair in this spectrum for the first time? Use something else or go to a stylist.  This product is terrible."
9701,1,"Good with hard water_I've been using the shampoo for a couple of weeks and I have to admit that it is pretty much as good as the &#34;Washee&#34; expensive shampoo that thought was the best in hard water. Our water is SO hard that it comes out of the tap a pretty turquoise blue (copper pipes and calcium) anyhow, it is usually almost impossible to get a shampoo to lather, this one does well. It also seems pretty gentle on my thin, weak hair.I use this in conjunction with a suave conditioner (Morrocan Infusion) and the two work really nicely together, leaving my  hair soft-- almost unheard of with our water. I used it with some other conditioners (mainly little hotel bottles like gilchrest and soames) and the combo isn't as nice.I'd recommend this for any type of water or hair. If it does well here, it should be even better with softer water (and nicer hair!)."
157,1,"Beautiful Hair Color_Title says it all :) It's gentle, easily covers my roots, and gives my hair a luminous golden color with multi dimensional highlights. Will buy again!"
2932,0,"Barely creamsicle_I did not like the aroma.  I know (and love) orange and I know (and love) creamsicles but this is no creamsicle.  Scent is such an objective thing.  I reviewed a skin cream called Just Carrots and I love the aroma but other reviewers didn't.  Go figure!  I was so distracted by the scent of this Ilumina body lotion that I did not give it much of a chance on the moisturizing side of things.  I couldn't give it away fast enough.  (Sorry, Ilumina!  You can't please everybody!)"
8927,0,"40 pcs? You meant 14 pcs!_I was very disapointed with this order and I hate to be the barrer of bad news, but I gave this company many of opportunities to make their wrong, right. They not only sent the wrong amount, I complained to them, and I still didnt recieve the other 26! They need to change the size of the quoted amount, and let the consumers know that they will only recieve 14pcs. I will not order from them again until they do right for the customers... Thank you"
1955,1,Many uses_I highly recommend this product to everyone bc it has so many uses. This was well worth the money spent.
6571,1,i love it_i get to play with my nails an dtry to do different things with it. its had lots of nail art
5442,1,"A great selection of colors to mix and blend._Love this eyeshadow kit I only wonder why it is a bit much on here as I had previously purchased mine from Target for only ten dollars. But it is nice to be able to find it on here in case you can't get out and have to order online. I found the eyeshadow to be easy to blend and create some lovely smokey eye looks, it helps to also use a base on the eye before applying the colors really pop."
8491,1,"Excellent Styling Gum_I generally prefer hairspray to styling gum, but I thought I'd give this Axe styling gum a try. While I'm not a big fan of messy, those looking to this product to provide a messy hold will be in luck. It really works.The styling gum works perfectly with minimal effort. Styling your hair should not take long in the morning with this stuff. Further more, I found that it washed out fairly easily. I did not have to be in the shower for longer than normal with this stuff.This styling gum is the read deal. It works great and doesn't cost too much. I wasn't expecting to like this product as much as I did, but it is really quality."
4183,1,Avon Anew Reversalist Day Cream spf25_I love having an Avon day cream with SPF.  It's the perfect day cream for when I need to spend a lot of time outdoors.  Unlike sunscreen this does not clog pores and works great as all the Avon products have for me.  I love it and would buy it again for summer.  My absolute favorite AVON product of course it their clinical line.
6261,1,"Very good shampoo, especially for the price_I have been using this shampoo, with the conditioner as well, for about a year. I love it.I have thick, coarse, colored hair. So I need all the conditioning I can get, and this shampoo and conditioner provides it. Loreal also has the regular nourishing one (solid gold bottle), but I prefer this one because its stronger. This product leaves my hair softer and healthier, and because its sulfate-free it takes care of my color too, even when I had red hair, and red is hard to take care of. For a while, I was using the Matrix (orange bottle) and was paying a fortune, and I wasn't happy. So I switched to this line, and will not go back, plus I'm saving lots of money!I saw that some people said this weighed down their hair, and I can see that. This particular line from Loreal is the one packed with the most nourishing. So if you have fine, thinner hair, then it will most likely weigh your hair down, and even might make it on the greasy side. But if you have coarse or thick hair, I think this shampoo is perfect, and at a great price."
9779,1,"Smells good, rinses clean_Smells good, gets my husband clean, not too teenager-smelly or overpowering, and doesn't have those scrubby &#34;micro beads&#34; that are horrible for the environment. Will buy again."
6607,1,Perfect..origianl Jergens Scent.._Perfect..I love this soap..I haven't been able to find it at my usual store anymore..have tried other stores..no luck their either..love the scent and feel of this soap..so glad it was available on Amazon..
5718,1,"A fiesta for your fingers!_This is a great summer or vacation color.  Easy to apply, bright and cheerful, it's perfect with summer clothing or maybe even a pick-me-up in the winter.  I'm going to try it on my toes for next vacation.  Great color for your Shellac collection."
692,1,Good Strength._This and Diamonds and Rubies are the only two scents that are 'Atomic Bomb Strength' and can hold their own as far as scent goes.  This I do recommend for scent bolstering.
2159,0,Smelly and sticky..;_i thought that castor oil wasn't supposed to have a smell... well it smells like rotten bananas. and it's also very very sticky.. This is my first time ever using castor.. i think castor is supposed to be sticky in consistency but not smelly like rotten bananas! yeck!
7535,1,Great deal_It is small and not that heavy so it's easy to carry around and plus it comes with a strap which makes it even easier to carry. Since the case is black and not noticeable if its is dirty.
1511,1,"hello_no directions with it not very happy about that dont know how to use it , dont know if it would order again but was very fast and exact what i order ty and was very fast and shipped was what i wanted  ty"
4815,1,top coat must have_I found the Harmony gelish products were great. I didn't think about  a top coat but it is a must have when doing shellac nails and it is  a great price.
431,1,Love this oil._Great price for this amount I dry off every day with this oil. My skin is so much softer and younger looking from using this oil. I use it all over my entire body except my face and I love it.
4730,1,"Oh yeah!_I just got this palette and I LOVE it! What a steal...$44 gets you 12 decent-sized shadows, a double-sided eyeliner, and a mini Primer Potion. All of the shades are neutrals, which means you can wear them to the office (except maybe the glitter ones). The colors are great, and I can honestly say that this is the best palette Urban Decay has ever put out before. I suggest you order it pronto!"
6472,1,I have been exfoliated_This is a great product and works better than advertised. I use exfoliating soaps and other exfoliating devices. I know they are working because they are scratchy. These Simple Exfoliating Wipes are not scratchy so I thought they were not working at first. Then I could visually see that I was disn-foliated.Yep all them there naturally occurring flaky excesses were removed. I wondered if it did that to my face then want about other body parts. I know what you are thinking; I meant arms. Yep these wipes worked there also.I tested them to see if they really had no perfume. Many items that claim to be fragrance free just have a lower smell level. I tried the nose test and sure enough there is no hint of a weird under smell.One thing I always do and even if the package does not suggest it. Some items like ALOE VERA can cause allergic reaction in some people so I tested a small area first and waited. Turns out that I did feel something (clean).I also find this critter a quick way to spruce up if you are too lazy to hit the shower before bed. This does not replace a good dose of water but cuts down on the itching while you sleep.
3050,1,"Very similar to a couple of other Remington Hair Straighteners_I recently reviewed theRemington S9950  Shine Therapy  Moisturizing and Conditioning Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener, 1'and found these two straighteners to be very similar, but not identical. It also appears to be the same as theRemington S-1051 Sleek n Curl  Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Tourmaline and Bonus DVD, but without the DVD.The back on this one has a better grip, and the plate technology on this one is different (not better, just different). The plates on here are made of Tourmaline, Titanium, Ceramic; but the plates on theRemington S9950  Shine Therapy  Moisturizing and Conditioning Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener, 1'are ceramic and infused with conditioners and avocado oils.Other than that, the temperature, cords, plate size, locking mechanism, digital temp display, and swivel cord are identical.So far, I prefer the blue one (Remington S9950  Shine Therapy  Moisturizing and Conditioning Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener, 1', but time will tell whether or not the infusion of conditioners retains it's ability to keep working after a period of time.Both include a four year warranty as well.I will point out that my reasons for knocking down a star on this one are the same as on the other one. I don't care for the locking mechanism. I have other straighteners with better designed locks."
9501,1,"best for people who do not have oily hair_The shampoo works great, but I would say it is best for people who do not have oily hair.  The scent is great, the shampoo suds up very well, and really gets hair clean, but because of the conditioner, I only can use it occasionally as it will get my hair too oily.  I would say it is best for those with dry hair."
3612,1,Neat little filing tool_Does a great job with all its different sides. One worry though is you will probably have to buy another one if they wear down. But my nails are lookin good thanks to this handy little guy.
2778,1,"Excellent for Sensative Particlulars_I typically have to use hypo-allergenic, pricey feminine wash for my extra sensitive particulars. This Dove bar soap has replaced the expensive feminine products in my shower and works for my entire body and face as well. It's gentle, leaves my skin clean and soft, and last's longer than liquid gel body wash. A GREAT value."
4998,1,"Great base coat_I received this OPI base coat free when I bought two polishes at Ulta so I was very eager to try it.  I used it for the first time as a base coat for the Nicki Minaj Metallic for Life polish.  I was pleased to see that it gave my nails a very smooth finish to them before I applied the polish.  It did not help the polish stay on for very long since the Metallic for Life polish started chipping off in two days ( I have bad luck with glitter sometimes so I did not soley judge the product by this experience alone).  I was very happy to see that it did indeed stop my nails from being stained which happens almost always with dark polish.  Overall, it gave my nails a smooth finish and helped dark colors not to stain my nails so I was happy with this product and would recommend to anyone who just wants a basic light base coat.  It is not a ridge filler or anything so I did not expect any miracles.  It does what it says and that was all I asked for."
5432,1,best mascara_I purchased this mascara after reading all the reviews. I have been on a search for a mascara that doesnt clump up..this is a perfect one! I love it and i carry it everwhere! I wish i bought an eyelash curler though! lol :)
2551,1,"Satisfied!_I have absolutely no complaints about this product, and I've used it many times. It heats up pretty quickly and does not leave hair my looking frizzy."
5474,1,"pretty good_I wanted to try out some new eyeliner, and this was very reasonably priced for three sticks so I decided to try it. I bought the 'blue' set and from what I can tell, the 'blue/black' pencil is just straight up black. I normally like to wear a navy blue eyeliner on my bottom lash line because I feel like it makes my eyes prettier, but I don't see a difference at all. That isn't too much of a problem though, it's still a good liner. My biggest disappointment was that the brown liner is so light, it's barely visible. Overall, I wouldn't NOT recommend this product, but I wouldn't necessarily rave about it. For the price, it was worth it, but if you're looking for what it claims to be (a black, a blue/black, and a brown liner set) this is hit and miss."
4405,0,"LA Girl not SHANY_The marker clearly says LA Girl on the top of the marker, which is not clearly visible in the picture shown here."
5209,1,Great product_This is a great smelling body wash. My daughter loves it. Got this for her as part of a gift.
8178,1,"Beautiful alone or with water marbling_Love this polish, has a very subtle sparkle, not too much. This formula is a little on the thick side and dries fairly quickly, so smooth even application looks best. Keep some polish thinner on hand, as this polish can dry out a tad faster than other polishes when not used. Do not add polish remover to polish in order to thin it."
5578,1,"I like the consistency, not sure its expired...?_I use this on a daily basis and I dont really know if it really works. The product looks like it has little dots in it, like it doesnt have a consistency color and consistency which makes me thing it might be expired (but I dont know how long sunscreen usually lasts)"
7812,1,grezt tattoos at a great price_My 15 year old daughter loves this kit! That's saying a lot. They look cool and stay on for a long time.
5814,1,"Moisturizing Cream_I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin.  So far, this has been the only lotion that I have been able to use without breaking out; the product is light enough that my skin doesn't feel clogged, but it continues to work all day.  It leaves my skin feeling refreshed, and takes away quite a bit of the redness and irritation."
5506,1,"Favorite Palette._I was hesitant to buy this product at first because I don't own any expensive make up. I'm glad I finally bought it, its amazing, my other eye shadows have been neglected ever since I got this baby. I use it with Urban decays primer potion to make the shadows last and pop. I use this everyday and cant wait to get the second naked palette. You can create a lot of looks with the colors provided, I use every single one of them. All women into make up should get this, you won't be disappointed. Its worth the money."
5168,1,"excellent curling iron_it heats up very fast. smooth curls with shine. doesnt burn hair. several heating levels, highly recommended. great value for money"
8690,1,"Very effective and gentle_I really like using these little pads to get stubborn eye makeup off at night. It does take a few swipes to get it all, but I don't mind. The fragrance is light and I never have any problems with my skin feeling oily afterwards, as with other products I've used. I also have not had any problems with stinging in my eyes, which can happen easily when you are using any kind of soap around your eyes. If they were also flushable, then they'd be perfect!"
5290,1,"Fixed dry, itchy, burning lips in one day!_Between my dry mouth, the sun, and a few random foods, my lips have itched and burned off and on for years. It's been awful the last few weeks. Burt's Bees and Trader Joe's were two I used. They wore off quickly whether I licked or rubbed my lips or not. So, I was always putting it on. Not cool. I got the Neut. Revitalizing Lip Balm today and put it on at 2:00 pm. I didn't think much about it. A slight itch later meant reapplication. I just now realized it's 11:30 pm. I haven't thought about my lips for hours! I put more on, but my lips are soft with no itch or burning. I am astonished. Yep, it's expensive, but it's the most effective balm I've found. I need a whole bunch of these."
2774,1,"Works really well_Makes my frizzy hair a lot softer and calmer, not greasy, smells nice, all-natural, and a little bit goes a long way."
19,1,"My love has returned after all these years._I remember these from my teen age years, marriage, raising my children and then they disappeared. The other day I was watching a program(Mirror, Mirror) where they featured top models and their beauty regimen. To my excited surprised I see one model using a Buf Puf. I ran to Google and found them being sold on Amazon and some other retail stores. Amazon was the least expensive and I purchased 6.How wonderful to feel that strong clean feeling when using the puff. It is better than any blemish control scrub on the market and leaves no grainy residue.. I could feel those dead skin cells sloughing off and after only one use my skin felt cleaner than after  any clay.mask I have removed. Needless to say I am thrilled and recommend them to anyone even with sensitive skin like i have.This is a facial in a sponge."
1552,1,"This is a beautiful brush_This brush is so nice, the size is big and just perfect.  It is easy to hold and is a very nice texture.  All in all, its a very nice brush and I'm happy with my purchase."
9763,1,Just what the doctor ordered for my uneven skin tones!_Just what the doctor ordered for my uneven skin tones!  I was always conscious of my uneven skin tones on my face.  This product is working wonders.  I have noticed a big difference already.  And a little dab will do ya with this product.  So it lasts quite a long time too.
8946,1,"Quality made Luscious feeling  TEN star product_Not only do I look closely at items I expect them to be what they claim to be.  Have also posted a photo of the brush I received.This is a beautiful brush as well as a well made one. Love the wood which is smooth and luscious feeling. There is a beautiful silver ring around the base of the brush that makes it look elegant in a French zen way.  Actually thought the brush itself was made from rabbit fur because its so utterly soft and dense. This is 100% quality made.And while I certainly will use it for my face, the fact is we are using it for a young family member who had heart surgery and has a sensitive long area on his chest that has been stitched up but needs cleaning in the shower daily. This brush works great!!  Have a friend who is a recent burn victim and she wants one because her skin is so sensitive when she washed and this brush felt so soft to her that she was going to buy one herself.This is a product I not only will recommend but I will be buying them as gifts because I feel they are an excellent product that would make a special and useful gift."
318,1,only used once_ive only used once so far so good we will see nice price I hate spending much on toners but I  do like this one so far too soon to tell ifi will use long term but we will see.
4096,1,"very nice :)_gorgeous color and its has tiny tiny gold flecks in it so when you take pictures you look illuminated.love, love,love"
1416,1,"Excellent product!_This is a great acne lotion. It has 2% salicylic acid...some lotions have only 1% or even .5%. This lotion has a very nice texture, it almost feels like a primer after it dries. Best of all, it has a very light, pleasant scent, unlike most Neutrogena products that have a heavy perfume."
9231,1,"I like this_I purchased this to add extra health and glow to my skin. I have uneven skin and vit C is good for evening skin tone. This feels really good on my skin, especially after harsh exfoliants like retinol or peels.  It feel like my skin drinks this stuff. I will prob repurchase"
6341,1,Fabulous Brush_This is a wonderful brush. I have to give Spornette KUDO's for an awesome product.I'm a cosmetologist and My clients love it.
9190,1,"It just plain works_I suffer from cystic acne, so my acne is much more stubborn than most and was considering Accutane, but decided to try this before going to the derm as a last attempt and haven't looked back. My acne started to diminish in a month and completely disappeared after 3. Although it wasn't a cure overnight, it was still a cure! And my cysts haven't returned since, just have to keep consistent."
2467,1,Wow....where would I be without this product?_I have used this product since my very first ZIT!!!!  It is cover up/make up for MEN!!!!  And it heals my acne very quickly.  What a life saver before a date:)
2587,1,"This product is a must-have_I've been using this since DHC first started selling in the US. Like others, I was very skeptical about putting oil on my oily skin, but after using a couple of samples and having it leave my skin squeaky clean after rinsing, I became a convert- almost a zealot. I can't imagine ever being without it again."
1831,1,Love this blow dry lotion for fine hair_It's not too sticky or crunchy and does give your hair body.  Unlike a mousse it won't make your hair frizzy; I really like this product.
2382,1,Roc complee lift eye cream_Excellent product.  It does exactly what is advertised.  It helps my poor eyes look younger.  I would recommend it to anyone.
6109,1,Great for those uncoordinated gals_I am such an idiot with eye liner. This is the first one I've ever worn that I was able to get on straight because it's thick. Thank you Sephora!!!!
654,1,It's blond?_I have light blond hair but this looks like baby powder has been sprinkled in my hair. It's nearly white. Just be aware of this when you choose a color. I've used Toppik before and I like the product otherwise.
8619,1,"Salon quality hair conditioner_I use this new Nexxus Hydra Light conditioner with Nexxus Hydra Light Shampoo every day.  Both contain cocnut oil (to add moisture), panthenol and sea salt. Sometimes, when one uses conditioner it makes hair heavy and flat.  This is not the case with this new line.  Your hair will have volume and look rich, beautiful and healthy.  Prior to drying my hair, I put Rusk leave-in conditioner on the damp hair (especially ends) and that keeps hair straight.  I finish off with mist with SPF to protect my hair from sun damage.  Nexxus offers the same products in its own line.  I do not use them now, but plan to do that as soonb as I finish my current products.  Fragrance of this products is great and that is why I like to combine it with the shampoo of the same brand, so the overall frangrance remains the same - ocean like."
9986,1,"No more cold spoons_Everyone knows the traditional remedy for puffy eyes in the morning is to leave a spoon in the freezer and set it against your eye in the morning. That is not only uncomfortable but it is not the best thing for your skin. Using this adovia cream is way more useful and actually reduces the prevalence over time of puffy eyes, even at height of allergy season. The areas of eye puffiness are just healthier and more resilient and are able to fend off the effects. Really pleased with the results on this eye cream."
9586,1,Sooths my fine hair_I have very fine hair that tends to have fly away ends (mainly from breakage).  This product keeps my hair looking smooth without weighing it down.  The scent is light and not annoying.
9857,1,Quality Oil_This oil feels as rich and luxurious on my skin as the bottle it comes in looks. It rubs in easily and leaves my skin soft without making it oily. I also use it in my hair as a treatment before showers and as a smoother after I dry my hair to keep my hair soft and touchable. (and get rid of the &#34;frizz&#34;)  My hair has never looked better and it also has helped keep my scalp hydrated and flake free. It's way better than any moisturizer I could think of using-it's all natural and leaves my skin soft and touchable without the added chemicals or greasy feeling some oils leave behind. It has even replaced my regular facial moisturizer. A must have in any beauty regime.
4316,1,"In use this on my curly weave_I have not used this on my natural hair but i have used this on a processed curly pattern weave that became very unmanageable to deal with.  I used this as the leave in after conditioning with the silicon mix conditioner.  They worked well together, but i have not used this without the other to know if it will work just as good on its on."
8951,1,"I received the lashes as shown_I love false lashes and, these lashes are exactly as shown. The band is thick and, they do curve. I highly recommend these lashes because, they are very different from the ones that you usually see."
810,1,"Best biotin supplement_I have re-ordered this supplement two times. It's by far my favorite out of all the Biotins - and I have tried a whole bunch of them! I notice a lot less hair loss in the shower, even after re-starting after just two days (Ran out - was waiting for more to come!). My hairdresser told me my hair was growing in much faster with a lot less dead ends. For the price - you can't go wrong! Best on the market in my opinion!Namaste"
4007,0,bought this for my uncle_i dont think he used it everyday tho. maybe thats why it didnt really work. it did leave a weird white residue on his head and it became itchy
3548,1,"Nice Selection_This set offers a really nice selection of brushes. It can be a little difficult to see what kind of brushes you are getting based on the picture, so here is what you can expect: 3 face brushes that can be used for powder, blush or bronzer. They're all slightly different sizes, but they're pretty similar. You also get a really nice fluffy fan brush. It's more like a flattened powder brush since it's at least 3 times thicker than a normal fan brush. You also get a very small detail brush that works well for lining lips or for cream/liquid eyeliner. There is also 1 sponge tip brush, which is essentially just the same sponge tip applicators that come with most eyeshadows but on a brush handle. You also get a spool brush for eye brows and a dual ended eyelash brush/comb. The remainder of the brushes are either 'c' eyeshadow brushes or flat top brushes. They're all in those 2 shapes, they just come in a variety of sizes.The brushes are all synthetic hair, which is nice for lip products, concealer and for using eyeshadows wet, but you might find that you have some difficulty applying eyeshadows dry. It's not impossible, but the brushes tend to create a lot of fall out with dry shadows. I personally got this set to use with pigments and loose mineral shadows (which I apply wet using a makeup setting mist)and they work perfectly.Over all, I'm impressed. It's a nice set for the money and even though there are a ton of similar brushes it's nice to have some clean backups in my collection. In my opinion it's missing some essentials, like a foundation brush and a blending brush - but otherwise you can create a full makeup look using only these brushes."
3555,1,"Great brushes_Once again shany has done it again.like i said before great quality brushes,love the bristles they are soft but firm."
3011,1,Wonderful Product!_I purchased a couple of these & plan on getting more at a great price on Amazon! Beautiful colors....no sticky feel....just a tad bit of shimmer....love these....but of course a lot of the discontinued items from yesterday were outstanding....like these.  So happy to find them on Amazon....Thank You!  Buy these....you will not be sorry.
436,1,"Absolutely Amazing!_The first product in this line that I tried I freaking hated! The Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose. I absolutely hated it! It did not moisturize my hair in the least I have no recollection of if it made it softer or not and I was never a fan of the smell of roses. It's a light scent but I still am not a fan. I decided to give the GPB conditioner a try based off of a review on YouTube. And I love this stuff. It goes on very smooth, I love the smell of lavendar. I recently started to mix in olive oil with this treatment! It makes my hair very soft and since it is a light protein treatment it makes my shedding...less. I totally give this 5 stars. I have 4a hair."
1002,1,"New at indoor tanning_It has been confusing what lotion to buy for indoor tanning. This is a after tanning lotion only. This is my first one I bought and it works.I have been on a tanning bed 5 times without any lotion. MY skin is red but does not hurt I do have one spot that does hurt  a spot that does not get sun.Well, I received the lotion yesterday. I did go tanning when I came back my front looked like a red lobster. Before I sat down I put on the Moister lock lotion. I actually did it twice. By the way the smell is very clean and refreshing. This morning my front is still red but not anything like last night. The area that was hurting does not hurt any more. I feel so good I am going back today for another tanning session.I will keep you updated on this and other lotions I have ordered. I am going to stick with the Australian Gold products which everybody said was the best."
9621,1,Love this_Love this wand. Big soft curls. Once you get the twirl of it!
1570,1,AMAZING...seriously_I absolutely love this! Its the perfect weight for my face...never too oily or heavy! I recommend it to EVERYONE!
9908,1,"Konjac Sponge - Activated Charcoa_I have always known the importance of exfoliation and have tried many things over the years. I have tried microdermabrasion crystals, drugstore facial scrubs, homemade sugar and honey scrubs, special microfiber face towels and many more. I recently had heard of Konjac sponges and wanted to try one about a year ago but at that time I had just purchased a NutraSonic which is a generic brand of the Clarisonic facial brush. I had seen nice results with it and figured I did not need to buy anything else at that time. I was given the opportunity a few weeks ago to try out the Konjac sponge and jumped at the chance.The sponge arrived and I could not wait to try it out the next day. This particular one is a small, round dark grey Konjac infused with charcoal. It arrived with a string (thread) attached and a plastic hook on suction to attach and hang in the shower or on your bathroom wall. The next day I used it in the shower. I was not sure how long to soak it for the first use, so I soaked it in hot water for 3 minutes. After soaking for 3 minutes, it seemed ready to use. I noticed that the sizing did not increase as much as I hoped and it was not the easiest to hold in my hand. One side was more rounded and the other side was flat. I felt great on my face as I lightly scrubbed around my nose and cheeks and chin. I had wished it was about double the size and more teardrop shaped so that it would fit more into my palm and be more ergonomic to hold. I found it to be quite relaxing to use and my face felt smooth and soft after using it.What exactly is Konjac? It is a moisture rich perennial plant native to Asia, and loved for its health promoting properties. It is used as a medicine, a food, and as a beauty product. It is naturally alkaline, and balances the acidity of the skin's impurities and oils and promotes new growth of skin cells. This sponge is made of 100% pure vegetable fiber and contains activated carbon and essential minerals. This pureSOL Konjac Sponge is free of parabens, sulphates & chemicals. It is suggested to replace after 2-3 months of continuous use.I did not have any redness or irritation. I have been using it every day for almost 2 weeks and like it a lot. My only request would be that the company adjust the size to be bigger so that it is easier and more comfortable to hold and use. I had been using this with just water, but today decided to use some of my charcoal bar face soap. It worked great and I would say I like using it either way. This is a nice Konjac sponge and I would recommend getting one if you are thinking about it.If you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate is as &#34;helpful&#34; and or leave a comment. I enjoy writing reviews and hearing feedback about what I have written as I feel reviews help those interested make an informed decision before purchasing. I also feel that honest and informative reviews improve a product by providing insight to the company. I believe reviews should be honest no matter whether an item was free, at a discount, or purchased. I am not connected to this company or any of the companies of products that I review. I am not paid for my opinions."
27,1,"Glad to find this product_I don't know if you can buy this in the stores anymore.  Years ago, I could find it just about anywhere.  I didn't think it existed until I ran across it at Amazon.  I've used different products since. So, listen up, I believe that AHA is a strong contributor to my skin looking as well as it does.  I've been using different strengths of AHA's for years and have great looking skin."
1155,1,The best Soap!_I love this soap.. I had problems with itchy skin which kept up most of the night scratching.  That is all gone now.Try it if you have very sensitive skin.
2806,1,"I am never disappointed by Nivea products_Nivea Q10 Skin Firming Body Lotion is fantastic! I am a long time fan of Nivea products, most recently using their Express Hydration product. I have had life long issues with dry skin. I started using Nivea as a young child, but back in the old days it left a greasy sticky feel on the skin. Nivea products have come a long way! Now, not only do their lotions work well, and in my experience perform as promised, but they are light and easily absorbed.Over the years my skin has indeed lost a good bit of its elasticity. Nothing is going to give back the nice, firm skin of youth, but this product does soften and skin stays soft longer. I will continue to use this and other Nivea products and of course recommend it to my friends.."
2842,1,"Recommend product_I highly recommend this product, to all, for blemishes and I also recommend rubbing raw honey afterwards for the scarring."
8948,1,"Love them_these are perfect for doing nails very edgy I think I got these at least three weeks before the date it was suppose to come in, they're a little sharp so yeah be careful sometimes but Thats because I'm very clumsy lol other than that there's nothing wrong with them"
2871,1,"Works well even on fairly sensitive skin._I have been pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of this product for my teenage daughter.  Her skin reacts to everything, sunscreen, lotions, makeup....so I was reluctant to let her try acne prevention cr&egrave;mes, especially after seeing the long list of ingredients.  However,  she was struggling with acne so I thought we would give this a try.  It has proven effective with minimal problems.  She does cut back on using the lotion to every other day if her skin starts to dry out."
6681,1,"Feels Nice; A Little Smelly_This moisturizes well and lasts for a long time. It didn't absorb as quickly as other moisturizers I've tried, but it wasn't bad. I don't like the scent, it was a little strong for me, but it became tolerable after a short time, and after a couple of hours I could barely smell it. Surprisingly, there are no artificial colors in this lotion.8/12/2012 Update: I've been using this nearly every day on my arms, and my skin is softer than it was. Used correctly, it's also effective as a sunscreen."
2874,1,TOO FACED SMALL GLAMOUR TO GO !!_THIS TOO FACED MAKEUP STAYS ON AND HALF THE PRICE OF TOO FACED WEB SIGHT SO SAVE YOUR MONEY PLEASE!! ORDER FROM AMAZON!!! THIS MAKEUP IS MADE BY AHIGH PROFILE CELEBRITY MAKE UP  ARTIST THIS MAKEUP IS AWESOME !!!! KC
7000,1,Amazing Shampoo_I love this shampoo. It leaves my hair with the perfect amount of moisture!! It smells great as well. I love dove its the only shampoo I use.
6595,1,"It absorbs fast_For me this product definitely needs something over it, it is not much of a moisturizer.  If you have super oily skin you could use a hydrating toner and then use this while your skin is still dewy and that would probably be perfect.  I ndo not have dry skin at all, more oily and I find that I always need some kind of hydrating toner with it and then a moisturizer or rosehip seed oil goes great with it.  I honestly havn't seen a huge difference but am going to continue the bottle and see what happends."
2014,1,pretty color and great price!_It's a pretty corally-rose color..not very pigmented though.
7230,0,"not good_These brushes are so cheaply made, its so sad, I mean they are pretty cheap, the paint on them smells so bad it makes me sick (and Im not sensitive to smells) one came broken, one broke when I tried to take the plastic cover off. No I would not consider this a good buy."
34,1,"This is the Only Cream to Ever Make Me Happy_I have extremely dry skin/psoriasis and I have tried all of the moisturizers in the world that claim to relieve dry skin but Cetaphil is the only cream that has ever saved me. It's really great for any skin type and I recommend it to everyone. It seems like it would be greasy but when its put on, it absorbs really fast and you can see that your skin really and FINALLY finally moisturized and its a rather wonderful feeling. I'm pretty sure that if I didn't use it, I'll have horribly dry/ peeling skin all over my face and look twenty years older than I actually do because of it. It's so wonderful! CeraVe and Cetaphil are the two moisturizers I highly recommend, but Cetaphil is still my favorite."
4040,1,"They work well, for the ones that actually work_I have had these since more than 2 years. I use them at least once a month. I store shampoos, face wash, body washes in them.Out of the three, only 1 started to leak after the cap/seal came off in 6 months. The other two still work very well.I usually fill them to 1/2 or 3/4th capacity. No leaks so far."
9724,1,Great lather!_Caress Body Wash has a decadent lather that rinses off clean leaving behind a light fresh scent and soft skin.  I will definitely be buying this again.
2203,1,"Amazing!_Dries super quickly and leaves a beautiful finished shine on the nails. The smell is kind of strong though, and there are warning labels due to chemicals in it."
9616,1,"The best beauty product I have ever used !!!!!_I am 43 years old with dry skin and hair. Over the years I have used many different products to hydrate my hair and skin. I have always been disappointed, and felt like I wasted my money. This product is a miracle for me. My hair is shiny and feels so soft and manageable. For the first time in my life my skin feels hydrated. The results were quick and the oil is so luxurious feeling. This is a great quality product and I honestly will use it as the base for my beauty regimen. I highly recommend this product!"
2946,1,"love it_No complaints at all. I got my set in red, it comes exactly how it's pictured. It's cute, I even have a brush to my sister since there's so many."
9977,1,"Surprised by this soap!_Recently I was given the opportunity to review an Adovia's product called their Moisturizing Mineral Soap with Dead Sea Salt and Minerals.  Adovia uses minerals from Dead Sea salt - as well as herbs and oils from all over the world.According to their item descrption it says:Item description:- Infused with 100% Pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead Sea- Dead Sea Salt Contains over 21 Minerals Key to Skin Health and Beauty- Deeply Moisturizing and Hydrating Soap great for Dry and Normal to Dry Skin- Dead Sea Minerals Essential to Skin Function Contained in the Soap Include Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc and More.- Great Value and Benefits for A Daily Moisturizing Facial CleanserFor budgetary reasons, I normally use some of the more popular drug store facial cleansers, but I've never really felt that they do a great job of cleaning my skin. I was pleasantly surprised by the mineral soap.  Normally people shy away from bar soaps due to their bad rep.  A lot of soaps contain lye which is totally horrible for your body and causes serious dryness.  Their are a few soaps out there made without lye, but their are far few and between.  Hence why body washes became so popular a few years back.  You were able to put in skin softening ingredients without the harsh chemicals needed and clean and condition the skin at the same time.However this soap was really surprising.  It isn't harsh and contains more natural ingredients than the slew of unreadable chemical names that you'll find on the box of any cleanser at your local drug store. The soap didn't lather as much, but that is given the fact that it lacks all those unnatural ingredients needed in order to get that result.  My skin does feel a bit cleaner than normal and combined with a face exfoliator it's even better.  Also it leaves your skin feeling hydrate since its all natural so you don't get the tight skin feeling that you normal have after using soap on your face or body.  In addition, it's great for washing away make up residue that may have gotten left over by your makeup remover.  I would say this soap is really gentle to use everyday and the fact that it's natural really makes it noteworthy.Adovia so far has surprised me with their all natural products by really giving me wonderful results!"
8278,1,"Don't Let this Treatment  Oil Leave Your Side! First Rate Multitasker!_I have always liked ease of use when employing beauty and skin care products, but more than that I prize effectiveness.  This generously sized bottle of Argan Oil (combined with Vitamin E) is a great, truly effective product.I have very fair skin which gets extremely dry in the winter, so I focused trying Argan Hair Skin & Body Treatment on my skin.It has a slight tint to it, and a light fragrance which reminds me of fruit. I like the fragrance, and the tint disappears when you apply the few pumps required to add the treatment oil to your skin.This calms your skin as well as adding the needed moisture. My legs and arms look 100 percent less flaky and dry. As I used my hands to apply this treatment, I love how they look now as well! They haven't looked this good all year! Also on the plus side, my hands are not greasy--I am typing this review with no problem. The Argan oil absorbs quickly and yet you know that it is doing its job. The bottle states that the treatment offers 'intense hydration', and the bottle is very right!I plan to use this every day, because it is fast and easy! I can apply it everywhere except the eye area (it to not supposed to get in your eyes). I also applied it on my hair. I like the silky feel of my hair after trying this treatment on my hair a LOT!Round up your products and replace them with this great Argan Hair Skin & Body Treatment Oil. It is the real thing. I am so happy with the results I have received by using this treatment. It is a do not miss  for you if you have dry skin or hair or need to repair your skin which is suffering from effects of eczema or psoriasis. I cannot say if it is the answer to the last two without a doctor's OK, but it really really helps. And it helps visibly instantly ... and it continues to help.One great product, many uses!  Love it!thanks,jean"
9062,1,Love OPI and Danke-Shiny Red_What's not to love about OPI?  My husband is German so it's natural for me buy some of the German collection.  I recommend buying this color.
5163,1,Rich and creamy_Very nice coverage.I use it for blemish spots under my mineral makeup and it stays fairly well.I like how creamy it is.
3904,1,"ALL SHIMMERS AND BEAUTIFUL!!_This is such an awesome eye shadow pallet!! they're all shimmery and gorgeous and blend together so well to create beautiful works of art on your eye lids =] i dont even have to wear primer with these, but when i do, my god are the colors so vibrant and bold!!! love them =]"
7460,1,"Adds body_It has a pleasant though strong scent.  The good news if you're sensitive to such things the smell only lasts in the shower.  I have long, wavy hair that's turning grey with the texture that grey hair usually has.  My hair is prone to tangling so I usually leave some of the cr&egrave;me rinse in after washing.  This cr&egrave;me rinse has an oilier texture than I'm used to so I was a little hesitant to do that for fear it would weigh my hair down but it actually came out fine.  In fact I noticed more body and a minimum of frizziness.The container design is flat where the product dispenses.  In effect you store the bottle upside down which allows gravity to work as the bottle empties.  Guarantees ease of use as the product ages."
5836,1,"Will never buy any other lotion_I love this lotion! My skin is normally red, dry and patchy. This lotion soothes it pretty much immediately. It does not have much of a smell. It also comes in a large container and lasts a very long time even with daily use."
793,1,"Good as a leave-in_I love this stuff. I've used it for 10 years. It's light and never weighs my hair down. It keeps my hair moisturized. I have straight, thin hair."
7712,1,"Works very well, love the portability and travel bag_Works very well.  I thought it would be annoying filling it up with warm water every single time but it's not, and it's much better than dealing with anti-fog spray. Wish I would have had this sooner."
3489,0,HUGE!_These cosmetic cases are enormous! They will take up your entire suitcase. They are very wide and tall. They looked really tacky but well made and sturdy.
3811,1,"excellent eye shadows_high pigments, wide array of colours. stay on for several hours when used with an eye shadow primer. excellent price for good quality eye shadows"
6903,1,"Nice cleansing, very light scent ..._This shampoo seems to work fine for me.  I like that it has a light scent and foams up real well.  Upon rinsing, my hair, what little of it I have left, feels clean, but not all squeaky and over-done.  End result is soft, clean hair that doesn't smell like a fruit factory. I'm a guy, I like it and would recommend."
1750,0,Crap_useless cheap piece of plastic this does nothing you can massage your face with your hand and get better results this thing is painful on top of that and it fell apart after using it 2 times my boyfriend fixed it but its just junk and the pink flower part that goes on your face is cut sharply and jagged very dumb pointless product should be only 2$ not 10$
7978,1,"Pretty Good_This is a nice product. I have used one product better than this called MED PEEL (Hyaluronic Anti-Aging) but I have to say you certainly get what you pay for and a little more with this product. It is a great product and you get a lot for your money. I would purchase it again and again!!! It is not as thick as the MED PEEL Hyaluronic that I purchased but a little of this product goes a long way. It is light, refreshing, and doesn't have a chemical feel to it. It certainly moisturizes my face and feels excellent."
7799,1,So Happy to Have Found These!!!_Shipping was much faster than estimated and the clips are exactly what I was hoping for...Just like the picture ...just like the ones I've always had but can't find anymore.  These are maybe not as beefy as the ones I've had before but work the same and better for me because they are a little lighter.  All of them seem to last the same so for the price...these are steal. I am going to watch over these a lot better because they are hard to find and everyone who has tried them Loves them.  Like other people have said..you can wear them under hats and sleep in them and when it's humid or you've just washed..these are perfect.  Great find from this seller.
229,1,"spray hair color_Worked just as promised, just have to be careful not to get color on clothing or ears."
8013,1,PERFECT &lt;3_This is the perfect shade perfect consistency and a great price. Will definitely purchase again! ITS TOTALLY WORTH IT :)
6581,1,"I love these_These are great, love everything about them down to their cute little holder and box. The colors go on smoothly, love the brush, and makes great designs! Couldn't ask for more"
923,1,"This must be what dreams are made of.. its like magic in a bottle!_I've been suffering from breakouts nearly my whole life and I've tried EVERYTHING.  cheap, expensive, masks, creams, gels, scrubs, professional peels, microdermabrasion, etc. I started getting stress breakouts right around my jawline and upper back. About 2 months away from my 30th birthday I was hell bent on finding a resolution.  I ordered a bottle of this stuff not really expecting much but starting mixing in a drop or two with my morning and night creams.  I also ordered the Dr. Bronner tea tree soap & liquid body wash as well. No joke, within 2 weeks, most of my pimples were GONE. 4 weeks later my face is looking better than it has since I was a kid. I've gotten a couple small pimples here n there but they pretty much dry up overnight. The smell of this stuff is a bit obnoxious especially for the first 10 minutes then it subsides, but not an issue for me. I can actually go outside without piling on the foundation and feel good in my own skin. Sometimes I just stare at my face in the mirror in disbelief. I dumped the oil in a mini spray bottle to make life easier. Do yourself a favor and try this stuff. I'd pay quadruple the price. Yes, it's that good."
3092,1,Review_My girlfriend loves all the manic panics and loves to mix them too with these brushes when she feels like it to great effect.
5352,1,Great Product_This primer is great!  It is silicone based and goes on so silky. I let it dry for a minute then apply everything else. It has a very light scent but I did not find it troublesome.
8175,0,"I don't get what the fuss is all about..._Loved the idea of this product being organic and still having a sunscreen. It was also a better price than my local spas...BUTIt's listed as Prime for shipping and this is NOT the case. It took a couple more days and when I contacted Amazon, I was rudely informed that upon checkout, this fact was in the fine print. Lame! Why are you advertising 2-day shipping?!?! :-(As for the moisturizer itself, I thought it was terrible. When it first went on, it actually stung in a couple areas that I was broken out. OUCH! When it dried, I liked that it wasn't all greasy but quite matte for a great makeup base. Unfortunately, it wasn't just matte but it was drying and made my fine lines appear more visible. Seriously, I looked in the mirror about 10 minutes after applying and I looked like an old lady! I actually gasped. It also left me with a bit of a white haze, making me appear somewhat sick and pale. I just don't get what all the hype is about. For nearly $50, I'll go back to Nordstrom and buy something with chemicals in it, thanks!"
2240,1,Carrying Case._I bought this to put a few random things in it and keep things organized.It isn't too big or too small and the zipper isn't flimsy.Great purchase.
985,1,"Weekly_I use this about twice a month to suck the crap out of my pores. It's not too drying, makes your skin feel super soft and smooth after use, and it has a pleasant mint scent. There is also a nice tingling sensation during use. Great product."
3984,1,"GREAT customer service_The product arrived late and two nail polish bottles where broken, spilling and drying on six other polishes. The customer service team handled it well, I was impressed with their professionalism and concern for their customers. I'm giving them 5 stars for handling it so well."
3083,1,"An all-around pumice stone_Exactly 190 micro-files safely remove calluses and dead skin fast.  Keeps my money in my pocket and out of the salon.  Smooth transaction, ty seller!"
4926,1,works for me_Ordered 2 boxes after reading reviews but I should have ordered 3. My hair is short but kinda thick and is curly. Didnt think this would work for me a black girl but it works dried fast and better than I had expected. It made the hair look flat ironed. I dont know my hair type but Im going to add pictures so that if you have my hair type and want to try something different you might give these a try. The first time was time consuming and I had to keep spray handy because my hair was drying faster than I could get it done. Im sure it would be quicker next time though
9269,1,"Leaves Hair Silky and Shiny_This product does a very nice job in smoothing hair and has a lovely vanilla/cream scent. It's lightweight enough that it doesn't make my color-treated hair feel oily after a day or two. I have short, wavy & thick hair, and look for something that gives a bit of shine as well as some 'lift.' Very pleased with the product. It does its job!!"
3002,1,"Stays on through sweat_I've had the hardest time finding waterproof mascara that actually 'stays on' when I start to sweat.  I finally found one brand, but it costs more than $20 for a very thin tube.  I decided to give this a try. The price is really good and it actually stays on. Another thing I like about it is that the brush doesn't have clumps of mascara on it that end up in your lashes when you apply it.  It also doesn't flake.  I slept in it to see if it would stay on. It was still on when I woke up, just a little less. None of it was on my pillow...there was a little residue under my lower lashes, but I'm going to chalk that up to my extremely oily skin. I'm glad I found this. Now let's hope Maybelline doesn't quit making it."
3266,1,Great Shadow Enhancer_I like how this pencil makes my shadows more vivid... It applies smoothly and evenly. The only thing I don't like is the packaging. I have yet to sharpen it but I'm dreading doing so. I wish it was a screw up or push up product.
4025,0,"product is defective_I am so shocked to read that so many people have had the same problem with this product as me, I thought it was an isolated incident. I too used it for 2-3 uses and then POOF the can was suddenly empty! there is definately some sort of defect with this product!"
8819,1,"great, long lasting fragrance_I have used a ton of conditioners that smell awesome, but after the first day, the fragrance fades. I condition my hair every 3 to 4 days and I must say, this fragrance is not only fantastic, but it LASTS. You may not notice this if you wash and/or condition daily.I must say that I didn't really notice my hair any smoother. I also use the other conditioner by Herbal Essence in the yellow bottle  which is the one for &#34;shine&#34;(same as this bottle only yellow), and I didn't notice my hair any shinier but the fragrance (once again) is what has me hooked on these products!!"
8483,1,"medium hold, wet look_I laugh when I hear people bemoan Axe's hold over today's young men. I am an old lady and I love the stuff! I am past the age where women cut their hair short, and I find I really like the hold and look.As with other Axe products, it has a really nice smell. It's easy to use and looks great. If you take a dab, rub it on your hands and through your damp hair, this product will give you medium hold and a damp look.Another great product from Axe."
7246,1,AMAZING_THIS SOAP EXFOLIATES AND LIGHTENS. I LIVE BY THIS SOAP LOL. I LOVE IT. THE ONLY DOWNFALL IS THAT ITS A BIT ITCHING AT TIMES. AND IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFULL AND GET IT ON THE WRONG SPOTS IT BURNSSSSSSSSS LOL..
8574,1,GREAT 4 NAIL ART._LOOKING FORWARD TO USING THIS PRODUCT TO DO SOME ART ON MY DAUGHTERS NAILS. HOPE TO USE THEM REAL SOON
6030,0,"good idea,,,but,,,,_If you have thin hair, you really should pass on this styling option. Even if you have long hair it may not cover up the device. It didn't cost a lot, so I'm not worried about gifting it to a friend. but for me and my thin blond hair, it stood out like a sore thumb."
6316,1,"Use it everyday!_I have really dry skin, and while this doesn't substitute as a moisturizer, it provides excellent, natural looking coverage over my oil moisturization treatment.If I'm having a bad skin day I use a little bit of a mineral powder foundation on my cheeks where I have more hyperpigmentaition. Works well to set the BB cream as well.Btw I am an NC35, and this is a teeny tiny bit light, but with some bronzer it looks perfect."
2744,0,It smells divine and love it but by the time it is half empty ..._I am giving this product 2 stars because it turns rancid so quickly. It smells divine and love it but by the time it is half empty it turns rancid.  I now buy the shea moisture which never turns rancid and I like it even more.
23,1,"Its good stuff_This stuff works pretty good. Good price also, will buy it again. Also use it on my 10 year old daughter who has been breaking out as of lately and it's not to strong for her sensitive skin"
9175,1,"So many uses , worth every dime!_Wow, this Shea butter is ultra rich. I love that you just dip your fingers , grab a little but of product, goes a long way. I use it after shaving , makes your legs not only shiny but soothes any razor burns.  I also use on my cuticles....a life saver!"
3699,1,"The best concealer I have ever tried_I have been using this concealer for 4 years now and I wont use anything else. It last literally all day without reapplication. Very good for hiding dark spots, scars and tattoos. Its one product I swear by and have yet to find anything better!"
4771,1,"Oooooh, it's so smooooth!_It really is smooth.  When I first ran it over my hair, I was very surprised.  I was using an el-cheapo Conair and this thing blows it away.  And it really does heat up in 15 seconds, which was another WOW.  The digial settings are nice because I won't accidently turn the little dial on the side and set it higher or lower than I want it.  This doesn't have any buttons or dials except for the power button and the up and down buttons that adjust the temperature.  So you can't accidently adjust it when it's not turned on.  The digital temp is easy to read on the top handle.  This thing is actually pretty, too!  The pink plates and matching buttons are a nice pearl-pink color.  This sucker is hot!  My old flat-iron was turned up all the way and still wasn't nearly as hot as the medium setting on this.  The bottom isn't super slippery and won't slide off my counter.  The cord swivels so it won't get all twisted and tangled up.  I was used to replacing my flat iron every 1-2 years because they are usually junk and break just after the warranty expires.  This one carries a four year warranty, which is impressive.  Also, it shuts itself off after an hour, just in case I forget.  The only thing I've noticed is that it tends to snag strands of hair on the corners if I'm not careful. Love this!"
6505,1,"Good, but it's pricey_Favorite hair treatment product. I initially received a sample via my Ipsy subscription. I purchased a full size on Amazon for a reasonable price. Will not likely buy again, as it's pretty pricey, and there are many alternative products that have the same effect at a lesser cost (see Argan Oil products)."
4603,1,Perfect for removing dead skin off your feet_I'm not one for maintaining my skin softness in the feet area but the Tweezerman LTD has proven to be quite useful if you've got dead skin building up.  The Tweezerman LTD comes with two sides for buffing and polishing your skin.  One side is more coarse and the other a lot more fine.  The grip is very comfortable on the Tweezerman LTD and I do recommend this product for your feet maintenance needs.
8238,1,"Great mascara overall_This wasn't the best mascara I bought, just decided to try something new on a whip. It's okay, not great."
8102,1,"Perfect!_This hydrating sunscreen is exactly what I wanted and didn't know existed until I saw this product.  It solves a quandary for me.  My daily moisturizer has an SPF 15, which really isn't much protection when I spend time outside.  The sunscreens I've used don't work well as a moisturizer, especially under makeup.  And if I put on moisturizer, and then a sunscreen, I end up with way too much product and a greasy or oily look.  So every morning, I was judging what product to use by how my morning was going to go, and was too often wrong.This two-in-one is terrific.  An SPF of 30 is good for my everyday use, and it is 'water resistant' for up to 80 minutes to boot.  Of course, when I spend an extended period of time outside, I need to reapply it, but I haven't seen a product yet where that is not the case.The scent is light and pleasant, not especially fragrant but that means it is not overly strong, too, and I don't smell like I've fallen into a vat of pina coladas.This is going to be my go-to daytime moisturizer/sunscreen from now on.  Happy!"
7969,1,Feel very clean after using it_I felt my skin tighten and very clean after my first usage. The battery was not very good as it died after 3 months and I had to change the new one. I wish the device could hold more battery. I charged overnight and used it only around 20 minutes.
9694,1,"Silky Hair, but Not a Great Detangler_Dove Pure Care Dry Oil conditioner promises hair that is five times silkier.  While I wouldn't say it's five times silkier, it does feel silky.  It doesn't weigh my hair down, and my hair doesn't feel dry.  In fact, it looks quite healthy.  My only problem with is Dove Pure Care doesn't detangle as well as some other conditioners.  Whereas I normally only need to run a wet brush through, I now have to comb it with my detangling comb first."
8061,1,"I like it!_This is a really cute nice little drill I'm really happy with it.  Its works really good and it was a great price.  Most nail drills re just crazy ridiculously expensive except for the ones that are those little pen ones.  But, his thing works way better than those.  I like how you can change the speed and it goes pretty fast.. and you can change if you want it to spin right or left.  I do my own silk wraps and acrylics and gel so its for personal use and friends and family im not  professional or anything but I do it ALOT..everyone always wants me to do their refills or put on sets or do silk wraps so they can grow them out..just all kinds of stuff...I was just always the family nail person and I really enjoy it but I don't know how the heck I used to do it without this thing.  It would take me forever to file off the layers of gel in order  to make it easier to soak things off. or to even out acrylic...it used to suck..so I love his thing..it has made it so so much easier for me and saves a crap load of time so I do recommend to anyone who does a lot of different kinds of nails."
7517,1,"Nice Brush_It is a very nice brush, well constructed.  My only reasoning for not giving it 5 stars is because I don't particularly like to use it for foundation.  I'd rather use it for contouring as I'm so used to using a sponge to apply my foundation.  Overall, it's still a really nice brush."
5575,1,"Nice color_I got'Hot Pink' because I was looking for a true red based pink, instead of being on the bluish side. The color is exactly what I was looking for.  It made my hair feel stiff and coated though and I could not get a brush through it."
5358,1,"Great Face Primer!_This face primer is like silk! I never thought I needed a primer.  I always thought primers were a waist of money.  I believed moisturizer was primer enough.  Well, this is a great product.  It feels great on my skin, and I find that I do not use as much makeup as I use without the primer.  I love this."
761,1,"Instant softness_I love this product.It is great for all ages, even mature skin like mine.It scrubs delicately and efficiently.The skin is very soft and smooth after use.It really makes the skin look healthy and livelier.Definitely  highly recommended."
6120,1,"Very nice Selection_I really like these great selection of gems they look awesome on the nail designs, I would order again the price is amazing!"
5397,0,Doesnt work_This product does not do at all what it is supposed to. It is basically a clear polish that does not make your nail color matte. It also messes up the color underneath. I immediately took it off after seeing what it looked like.
1580,1,"Product does what it should and is portable._I bought this to put in my gym bag and it fits well, is light, portable, and heats up quickly and evenly.  I have thick, course hair and it  takes a little time to get all the way through it.  But this product does a good job. I haven't had problems with tangles. I do recommend being carefull because the plates fold down on the sides of the device. I burned the edge of my forehead once because of this. My other straigteners plates don't extend over the edge so caution is recommeded here if you aren't used to that. I like the fact that I can adjust the temperature settings so many ways. This keeps me from over cooking my hair. This product is good for the price, and meets my needs, it is durable enough to carry in my bag and I use it 3 times a week. I'm not sure it is durable enough for everyday use, but that might just be because it feels so light. I've not had nay durabality issues with it."
9458,1,"Black Tea i chose_I'm a little embarrassed writing this since I am a man, but I don't think there is any shame in trying to look our best. Male or female, we all desire to be attractive. I put on some weight after an illness since I wasn't able to exercise. My thighs and arms went from fit to flabby, causing the appearance of some unsightly cellulite. I wanted a way to speed up the process of treating it while I got back into shape, and this product seemed to fit the bill. I chose the Black Tea scent since it seemed more 'manly', and I honestly do enjoy it. It's very light, so there's no worries about the scent being overpowering. I have simply incorporated the sponge into my normal shower routine, which was quite easy. The rough side of the sponge is the perfect texture for me and reminds me of most 'scrubbing devices' designed for males. After a month, the light cellulite on my arms has nearly vanished, and the more stubborn cellulite on my thighs has reduced a little. I'm confident that the combo of this sponge and some light dieting will solve my cellulite problems. To all the men out there, don't be afraid to do what you have to in order to look your best- confidence goes a long way."
8678,1,Finally a good product for my hair_I have very naturally curly hair. My hair frizzes easily and now that i have it cut with layers i have major fly aways if I don't use a product in my hair to control it. I have been buying a very expensive product from a beauty salon supply store for a few years now. This product is doing just as good of a job as the product i am paying almost triple for! The smell is great and it last all day.
4614,1,"By far my favorite!_Sooo many compliments on this color! I loved it for Winter because it is a deeper red, and it also looks great for fall. I will be using other colors this spring and summer, but my mother loves deep reds and wears it all year round!"
9822,1,Works amazingly well_I only need 2 drops of this a day and it hydrates my face for the whole entire day.  My skin routine has speeded up dramatically because I don&#8217;t have to use so many products anymore.
6839,1,"WORKS WELL BUT BIG CLUNKER_POWERFUL LIGHT WORKS WELL AND MY GEL POLISHES DRY HARD AND I HAVE A HOT MIRROR FINISH UNTIL I TAKE IT OFF. BOTH HANDS AND FEET FIT IN AND EASY TO CHANGE BULBS, ITS HINGED. GAVE 4 STARS B/C ITS BIG AND BULKY AND PLASTICKY AND KINDA CHEAPO,BUT IF IT DOES THE JOB,ITS ALL GOOD."
4064,1,Absolutely beautiful_I was going for the pin up girl look. This flower is beautiful. It is lovingly made...and the quality is EXCELLENT. It came with a sweet note and some candy. What a great seller.
2109,1,"Worked like a miracle on severe redness and irritation_I had purchased a jar of CDLM but could not bring myself to use it very often because it cost so much.  So it was just in my medicine cabinet for a long time.  My husband had actinic keratosis.  His physician prescribed Efudex which is a topical chemotherapy (F-5-Flouroracil).  It has to be applied every day for several weeks.  It kills the faster growing cancer cells -- but it also wreaks havoc on the healthy cells.  At the end of two weeks my husband had lesions that were red and even weeping, like burns.  At this point he was told to stop and use cortisone cream, but the cortisone did nothing.  He was in agony from the pain.  I just happened to remember that I had a tiny jar of CDLM and that it had been invented by a NASA scientist to treat his own burns.  I gave the tiny jar to my husband and he just slathered it on.  He had been skeptical but also desperate.  Well, it stopped the pain almost immediately and very shortly after the redness started abating.  The jar had almost been emptied!  I quickly ordered another, larger jar.  Now, several years later, I still have just the tiniest bit remaining in that second jar and I use it for emergencies if I have redness or irritation.  It still seems to work.  I'm not going to buy more but I have to testify that it really was something of a miracle worker in our extreme time of need!I do believe that my CDLM was the original version from Max Huber labs (says so on the bottom) -- before it was taken over.  Who knows if the current mass produced version is really the same as the original 'artisinal' version.By the way, my husband's face healed beautifully and the actinic keratosis is gone.  Efudex is not for the faint of heart -- takes courage to put yourself through the regimen.  But it works."
2631,0,"Not NAVY & not MATTE!_First of all, it looks more like dark purple than navy - I have exactly the same alreadySecond, the pic shown online is matte, which should be NM R54, but when I receive I realize it is normal Russian Navy, which is NL R54!I would for sure return it if it was refundable...."
2884,1,Very thick_this is a very effective sunscreen. it is very thick and stings like hell if it gets into your eyes! whoa! I now mix a few drops in my moisturizer instead of using the &#34;pure&#34; product on my face. I would repurchase if only for the SPF!
7389,0,"Does absolutely nothing!_I have been using the YouCurl wand (Conair) for over a year, and have loved it! Now my hair has gotten longer and so the diameter of my YouCurl created much tighter curls than I like, so I was simply trying to buy a similar product but of wider diameter. I should've just bought the same brand and model but a larger size, but I decided to try this one due to all the &#34;Keratin&#34; hype.I don't know if the unit I got was defective, or if adding Keratin (if that's actually true and not just marketing nonsense) prevents this from having any impact, or if this is just a terrible product, but it really did absolutely nothing to my hair, not even a slight wave.Bear in mind that I have mediterranean hair, so it curls pretty easily, and the old wand I had created the tightest curls for me, and they lasted for 2-3 days.I just returned it and bought another larger sized Conair model, lets hope that one works as well as the original!"
3009,1,"~Worth It~_Beautiful highlights, no brassiness. I was a dyed dark brown hair color...*waited 2 months....then put in these highlights. Left them in for 45 minutes and got a medium blonde shade. Very pretty. Everyone at work thinks I got it professionally done. The best part is the price! :)"
5715,1,"Tutti Frutti is a very bright pink_Good Spring/Summer Color.  Please be aware that this polish is part of the CND Shellac system and requires the CND Shellac Top and Base Coats to work properly.  Also you will need the UV lamp to cure the polish.  I don't usually get 2 full weeks from this polish but that could be because my technique is faulty.  I still love that the polish doesn't chip as easily as regular polish and I get about a week of wear before I feel the need to do it all over.  I can't stand chips or wear on the tips so if you aren't as picky, you might get the full two weeks."
5763,1,"great set of perfect brushes_love these brushes, I use them every single day and they make my eye shadow go on flawlessly. they are nice and softly textured and dont feel rough or sharp. They feel like soft bristle feathers really and make it so easy to apply flawlessly."
3307,1,"Great_I have thin waist length hair and these hold a pony for me all day, stay secure and no damage to m hair! Great colors and highly recommend especially for thin hair!"
7263,1,Good brush_This brush is a good purchase. I use it for my foundation. It gives me a good finish and it also cleans up really well.I have another brush from Bdellium and I would definitely purchase another.
9718,1,"Lathers and Washes Away Easily_This body wash is nice and thick and it lathers well.  It doesn't leave any residue on my skin.  The scent is light and pleasant while using it, but if you are looking for a lasting scent, this isn't it.  I didn't smell anything after I dried off, which is OK by me."
4225,1,"It works better than the cheap brand I got from Ulta but definitely does not work as well as Urban Decay's product._I tried to save a bit of money instead of buying Urban Decay's primer potion and I bought an eyeshadow primer from Ulta. It sucked. I read some reviews online for e.l.f products and decided to give this one a try. It works better than the cheap brand I got from Ulta but definitely does not work as well as Urban Decay's product. I apply this at about 7:30 in the mornings and by 12:00 or 1:00, my eyeshadow has become clumpy and collected in my crease. It's not awful, especially considering the price, but it could be better... or I could get less greasy eyelids (but I don't see a listing for those on Amazon)."
884,1,The best_I don't know how I lived before without this scrub towel. It's such a wonderful experience every time I use it.
7725,1,"Fresh smell and works well!_This shampoo has one of my favorite scents. It is a very nice fruity smell to it and I always get compliments on how fantastic my hair smells. I also think the shampoo itself does a good job! I shower every evening and this shampoo keeps my hair nice and fresh between showers! If I needed to shower every other day, I feel this shampoo would easily be able keep my hair clean between showers. Also, my hair is incredibly thick and long and I love the fact that this has a pump because I limit my shampoo squirts to 5/6 a day (so I can go for a run and shower twice if needed). This is a smaller amount of shampoo needed compared to other shampoos that are very water or don't spread very well.I would recommend this shampoo to anyone!"
3976,0,"JUNK!_I was looking forward to using this brush based on the reviews on Amazon. After two weeks of use, I am vastly underwhelmed.I use this brush to stipple on both powder and cream  blush. I use Nars powder blushes, and they are all heavily pigmented. A stipple brush is an excellent way of applying a heavily pigmented blush. This Bdellium does okay at it, but I did not get the soft airbrushed look that some better stippling brushes can master.For cream blush, I use Illamasqua or Chanel Soleil Cream Bronzer. The Bdellium brush hairs are not placed firmly enough to effectively control the application of cream color. I have to do too much work to  get the desired effect. I tried applying liquid foundation, but this also took too much work.I wash the brush after every second use, and it holds up okay. The shape and softness that the brush came with was not maintained after the first washing. My other brushes (Mac, Shu Uemura, Hourglass, Urban Decay, etc) hold up well after repeated washing, so I'm disappointed that this one does not.I don't have a problem with this brush shedding. It does lose a hair here and there but nothing major.UPDATE: I have had/been using this brush for six months now. It is mediocre at best.(1) It does not lay down color that well.(2)I am a stickler for clean brushes, and wash either every day or every other day. This brush does not hold up to repeated cleanings. The brush shape has changed and the bristles have splayed out and gotten more stiff, yet still too weak to pick-up color.I hardly use the brush because of these issues.Updated:This brush is just junk. The hairs separated from the ferrule in one  big clump. I have another Bdellium stippling brush (the smaller one), and the same thing happened.Best to invest in a good brush.  My best brushes have lasted years... I have one expensive brush that I splurged on when my sister got married 19 years ago!"
9008,1,"softens appearance of fine lines_the serum smells light/clean and glides on matte. I use less than a dime-sized amount & let it dry before applying an organic SPF face cream. sometimes i use stand-alone if i will be indoors all day.  I'm 37, look young for my age despite a fair amount of sun damage from when i was a teenager and thought I'd never regret a deep tan. 4 weeks after using the serum and my skin feels plump & hydrated throughout the day, fine lines are less apparent and I've received several compliments on how young I look and that my skin is 'radiant.' I wash my face with the sweetsation very berry masque and scrub, use an occasional organic pineapple peel, and the I*bright under eye cream from sweetsation. I also just began taking collagen supplements for skin hair and nails. it's difficult to pinpoint which products are doing what, but I am happy with the results!"
7059,1,"Sweet and easy handling!_I love this brush set, it's perfect for when I do my friend's makeup for weddings, dances, and events. I absolutely feel more confident when wearing it! The fact that it has a strap for your waist makes it feel more fun! Great brushes and great pouch"
1653,1,"LOVE IT!!!_Always makes my haird feel so soft, even when I color my hair I never use conditioners provided with them or with elaxers, I just use this & the big jug lasts for a good while so definitely worht every penny. Love this product"
4757,1,"This is a good concealer._Other than whatever chemical they use that may be carcinogen, etc., I love Mary Kay.  I haven't found any other makeup that gives you such a natural-looking yet flawless finish. I have scars on my face from a burn I received as a baby, and the concealing does a very good job of minimizing the scars. You just have to make sure you dot it on.  If you try to rub it on, you'll rub it away."
3381,1,"Great combo!!!_My hair loved this product. Reduced hair breakage, helped with growth and made my hair very soft after each application."
901,1,"Works Great on Hair Type 4a/b for Detangling_I had always heard about these brushes for detangling but could never find one. I ordered it off amazon and couldn't wait to use it on my Hello Hydration Conditioner Soaked Hair in the Shower. I sectioned my hair off, soaked it in HHConditioner and proceeded to gently work out the tangles. Great detangler and it works well on my hair as long it's soaked with conditioner."
7437,1,"I like the product  but the packaging leaks_I tried this even though I had previously not like another clear scalp product.  The long lengths shampoo and conditioner had not worked well for me but I decided to give the brand another try.Like the first Clear Scalp product I ordered, this one had leaked substantially.  I would estimate that about 1/5 of the product had leaked into the plastic wrapper surrounding the bottle.Other than that this was a completely different experience from trying the first product.  I really liked the smell.  The conditioner felt like it soaked in and rinsed out nicely.  My wet hair felt smooth and tangle free.  I live in the high desert so my hair gets dried out terribly.  It is also color treated.  But the Dry Scalp conditioner made both my scalp and hair feel good.  My hair was soft but had no  flyaways.For the price and performance I will keep using this product."
7216,1,"Nice product._Gelish is one of the best with gel nails to buy so i highly recommend this product, I made this decision because it was cheaper to buy as a bundle then separately."
9629,1,"Suave Gradual Self Tanner_This is the first time I've tried a self tanner. I didn't like the smell much. But I thought it was a good consistency for applying on my skin. I'm pleased with the color on my legs, after just a few times of use. Recommended."
8281,1,"Just as good as salon brand_My hair fell out. Not sure why, just one day it started thinning. I tried extentions and that worked for a while, but really, being able to see my scalp weirds me out. So I bought this cool stuff from the salon. $50 for a tiny little bottle that didn't last that long. This is virtually the same. You know you've seen the late night infomercials showing the shake on hair? Yep, this is just like that. And it works! Far less expensive than the salon version, and just as effective. Easy to use, lasts all day."
7861,1,"Wonderful nail plate case!_I received this 4 days after placing my order!  Love this plate case!  It fits my plates perfectly and holds a lot of plates. It is a compact design, measuring approximately 6&#34; x 9&#34; and seems to be made with quality materials.  Will be ordering another one soon as I have almost filled this one!"
855,1,a winner_This is one of my favorite perumes. VERY romantic..just as the name implies. A scent a woman would wear for a sexy night out with her man..or to wear when getting married!! Reminds me of soft pink roses....but not overwhemlingmy 'rose-y'.... which is good.
1654,1,"Love_I have long, thick, heat treated, and colored hair, so needless to say that a product that leaves it as soft and manageable as this does I make sure I am never out. It is well worth the price!! I do not like or use the shampoo, it leaves my hair feeling very rough, so I use the store bought Dove shampoo and this every day. I either half and half with Dove Conditioner, and twice a week just use this conditioner and love what it does with my hair. The smell is nice too and when you get use to it you will be able to tell if you get a shady seller not selling the real things. I will never again be without this in my home, Amazon seems to be the best place to get it as I have gotten 2 cheaper but fakes from ebay, never from Amazon sellers."
3243,1,"Glistening hair can be yours too._My hair is short and layered. It is colored (by me at home every two weeks) to cover the grey and white that now crowns my pate. My hair has always been thick and does have a mind of its own so a good cut, shampoo, conditioner and finishing or styling products are essentials. I also shampoo my hair every day so my scalp tends to be dry. My hair is not African as some of the reviewers have suggested that this product's  intended market. After shampooing, conditioning and towel drying my hair, I spray Motions Saloncare Maula Natural Therapy Hair and Scalp Oil onto my hair and scalp, massage it in and place in whatever style pleases me that morning and it is really shiny without being oily or sticky. This is great product for any hair."
26,1,"Decent moisturizer, but not for my kp_I bought this to help get rid of the keratosis pilaris on my upper arms and legs. The lotion did not help smooth out the little bumps and I found something better instead. Since I still had the whole bottle, I decided to use this as my night time moisturizer. I'm in my 20's so I have minimal wrinkles so I can't attest to how well it helps with those. My skin does feel tighter after using this though. Sometimes I use another moisturizer alongside this one because it can be drying. I wouldn't use it by itself if your skin is on the dry side. My skin has been smoother since I've been using this moisturizer and I haven't had a breakout in a while. I'm not 100% behind this product, but I think it is doing what it is supposed to for my face."
5747,1,"Very good brush_This brush is beautifully designed, high quality soft and smooth bristles allow perfect application of powder products.I've just added it to my professional kit... I love it!"
8639,1,"I like it, smells good, wish there was no cones_So far I like it, to me it smells pretty good, I wish there was no cones or alcohol denate in it. Here is the ingredients:ISODODECANE, DIMETHCONE, ALCOHOL DENAT., ISOPROPYL PALMITATE, DIMETHICONOL, PARFUM/FRAGRANCE, OLEA EUROPEAEA OIL/OLIVE  FRUIT OIL, COCOS NUCIFERA OIL/ COCONUT OIL, LINALOOL, HEXYL CINNAMAL, BENZYL SALICYLATE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, LIMONENE, AMYL CINNAMAL, CITRONELLOL, 2-OLEAMIDO-1,3-OCTADECANEDIOL, ALPHA-ISO-METHYLIONONE, HYDROXYISOHEXYL 2-CYCLOHEXENE CARBOXALDEHYDE, GERANIOL, ISOEUGENOL, CARROT OIL/BETA-CAROTENE.I think I'm going to be trying something different because of those issues I stated. Other then that it has a nice slip when I sprayed it onto my hair and some got on my fingers. I wanted something lighter then unrefined coconut oil because when going overboard on it, your hair looks greasy. My hair is wavy-medium thick."
6141,1,"Fun!_These are pretty cute, and there is a good amount of gems in the little wheel. They are a little bit cheap looking but you can't expect the world when you pay so little. I recommend! You can make a lot of creations with these little fellas."
7053,1,"Best soap I've ever used!_Upon recommendation from my hair dresser I decided to try the African Black soap. He had been using it for about a month and I had noticed the difference in his complexion. Like his, my husband and I have both noticed how bright and soft our skin has been since using this product. I actually noticed a difference in my skin the first time I used it! It has saved me some money that I used to spend for makeup remover. ( You will, however, need to remove your eye makeup your usual way. You don't want soap in your eyes.) LOVE IT! I also recommend that you get the unrefined shea butter to use as a moisturizer:)"
22,1,Truly great_This does not make my skin feel greasy. It absorbs very quickly and has helped my skin so much. Since I have been using this I don't have any cystic acne which is a major plus.
7325,1,A nice shampoo_My husband usually usues Head and Shoulders so it was nice to find something new to try. He has been usuing it for a little over a week and likee how it smells and leaves his hair soft. But the price seems to be a bit steep for our budget. I think Head and Shoulders (and the Target generic brand) are just as good for a cheaper price so we will stick with those.
8239,1,"Review_I'm enjoying practicing my nail art designs on these practice wheels. The best part is you can take it off with nail polish remover and start over again, love it."
5496,1,"Great_I love it, it's easy works great on my hair. Love everything about it . Never going to go anywhere else."
5004,1,"Good stuff_I use this one frequently after leaving the gym. The fragrance is nice, masculine, and lasts pretty good. One of the collection I will definitely keep."
5151,1,"Loreal Infallible le rouge 'Perennial Pink'_I'm really pleased with this lipstick. Long-lasting, at least for four hours or more. Goes on smooth and stays on. Not too creamy or sticky, just right!  I absolutely love the color Perennial Pink. I am blonde and fair-skinned so a bright color is too much. This is a very delicate pink, but you will see it, it's not a nude shade...very lovely and sexy."
4465,1,Petty_Pretty colors some reqire several coats to be opaque while others only require one coat. It is a nice set
7003,1,"Perfect for Beginners (not sure about professionals)_These are perfect and nice, coming in a bunch of different sizes (1-10). A few of the size 1's were cracked at the top but it's not a big problem for me since it was in the part I would have cut off and they don't fit any of my nails. I do have to say it kinda upset me that a few were in the wrong bags so I had to go through all of the bags and sort them, but they are so nice and for the price, absolutely perfect for beginners like me who just want to do the nails on themselves!"
4610,1,"Awesome!_The container is Really small, but the rhinestones are PERFECT sized for doing nails and there seems to be a lot in there. i'm not about to count them. Good product for great price!"
4478,1,"love it_love my new porcelain plate ceramic flat iron, leaves hair soft and smooth also great price. Highly recommend this flat iron."
4471,1,"Great for wet hair right after the shower but not quite the miracle product!_Bath times are always fine...but combing our wet hair post bath let to crying , grumpy kids - even after I tried every kind of conditioner on the market!  My sister in law told me about this and wow...I wished I had known about it sooner. I tried it on my youngest who has long, somewhat fine, naturally wavy hair and was impressed to the point of amazement!It took me seconds to comb out her hair, there was no snags, no snarls, just lovely straight hair. She was happy, I was happy..I wondered why I had been left out of this secret for so long. Why wasn't this in all the kid books / magazines.However, what I discovered is even in the finest of hair, this does not go all the way though and remove all snarls on dry hair. Even after using on wet hair and tying it back; by the time it was dry those snarls were back, more so on the underside where the teeth and not long or strong enough to reach.So it does a quick, good job on the wet hair, but really needs to be followed through with a regular brush with long teeth for best results; and on dry hair this is just a starting point.to get through those top layers and of course on girls with wavy hair this will cause more frizz, so I would not use at all on dry hair unless you are planning on tying it up!For its purpose though, bath times end with a few seconds of using this comb through the hair, it basically glides through like butter, with no force to the point my kiddo was asking if I was done already out of shock of feeling nothing. There is no tugging or pulling which is great for delicate wet hair, and it really is so easy, you will wonder why you did not come across it before! For the price and ease of use, and making bathtimes an easier process, this is an excellent item!"
6844,1,"Best Styling Cream_I've tried so many styling creams to find the &#34;holy grail&#34; of products, and I have to say, this is definitely a holy grail product.Like many other reviewers have said, a little goes a long way. I mix about 2 pumps of this with DevaCurl AnGel and scrunch it in my hair upside down (I do this with pretty sopping wet hair). Then I take an old cotton t-shirt and scrunch the excess water out.I'm careful not to touch my hair too much, or I put a braid in my hair and wait for it to dry. I always come out with shiny. bouncy curls.I am in love with this cream and will continue to buy it. Plus the smell is absolutely AMAZING. Definitely would recommend this to any of my curly haired girls."
9592,1,"Like the shampoo - need to try it with the other components_I haven't yet purchased the conditioner and treatment that will complete the package, so this review is somewhat incomplete.  The shampoo leaves my hair smooth and shiny but not weighed down and it smells terrific.  I'm still using L'Oreal Paris Advanced Hairstyle Boost It Blow Out Heat Spray as my treatment product after shampooing and the combined results with the Tresemme shampoo are terrific.  Not sure if the Tresemme trio would give better results but I like the Tresemme shampoo enough to try the conditioner and treatment.  I'm thrifty so I want to use up the L'Oreal heat spray first."
6637,1,Good._Some of the concealers are not that creamer but I it's a great deal being that you get all theses concealers for this bargain price!
5880,1,"The best mascara ever_It's hard to overstate how much I like this mascara. I was drawn to it by its 'clean & green' hype, but love it because it is light, lasting, non-smudge, cleans easily with soap and water, and looks great on. It does not clump, like too many products, but separates and covers lashes easily. Once on, it's light as air, never heavy. I've had some emotional situations while wearing the mascara, and still it did not smudge. I've been so exhausted I fell asleep without washing it off, and in the morning, no smudging. Terrific product!"
7063,1,"Love Love this product!_Since I can no longer find the Nature's Gate Natural Results Salicylic Acid Acne I have started using this product and I have been very pleased with it, its a great product to have, I would recommend 100%"
124,1,"It Works (Read Tips For Potential Effectiveness)_I purchased this over a year ago because I had so many post-acne hyperpigmentation marks on my face, including really dark and noticeable spots. I used this product for some time and for whatever reason, I moved on from it and stopped using it. I do remember it being decent, I don't remember why I did halt using this. Fast forward many months, I decided, 'I purchased this, why not employ the contents to completion?' I've been utilizing this for a few weeks now (solely on my face), and have really seen a difference. I'm not exaggerating when I say that every day in the last few weeks that I've applied this to my face, when I wake up and look in the mirror to see if any changes have occurred, I do observe that the post-acne spots have either disappeared or have diminished some what in tone. So people might want to know, what is my skin color? Because this product might have a greater impact on some skin tones over others. This is probably true, probably not. My facial skin color is that of a tanned brown skin-color.For the people who've recorded no results and have seen no visible improvement in their appearance here are some tips that I've carried out in hopes of ameliorating my post-acne skin condition:1) Wash your face at least twice a day (especially if you have either oily skin or medium-oily skin). I know this is difficult to do. For me, I come home after 11pm many times, and I'm too tired to brush my teeth, let alone wash my face, but this is vital in keeping up the fight for advancing the changes you want to see on your face.2) You have to allow the fade milk product to sit on your face for many hours at a time. For me, if I'm not leaving the house for whatever reason, I try to keep this on my face for AT LEAST 7-8 hours. I can keep it on for as much as 10 hours. You want the maximum effect of this item, and the only way it can do that is if you allow it contact with your face for a substantial period of time. 4-5 hours isn't going to cut it and I wouldn't be surprised if the results produced weren't too noticeable or impressive.3) Ignore the 'sunscreen' claim on this product. Firstly, it doesn't tell you how much SPF is on this thing, so you don't know how much time this fade milk is allowing you protection from the sun. Secondly, and this is important, it makes no mention of UVA and UVB protection, because it doesn't have any. And third of all, and this is also a significant point: this has hydroquinone in it. Hydroquinone is the lightening/bleaching agent. Anybody who's done some of the most basic research on lightening agents, like hydroquinone, knows that you're not supposed to be out in the sun when it's sitting on your skin. It's counterproductive. In fact, they warn you that bleaching agents can have the opposite effect when you're exposed to the sun, it can actually make your skin darker, not lighter. When I know that I'm going to go outside, especially for an extended period of time, I almost never use this product, and certainly never for its sunscreen purposes.4) When you sleep, sleep on your back. This goes for any product that you apply topically. I used to apply so many products on my face only to consciously sleep on my sides a few hours later. Like using bleaching agents and then exposing yourself to the sun, this also defeats the purpose. Most of the product is going to be swept away on your pillow case as opposed to being on your face, working. I know that sleeping on your back is not the most comfortable position for some people, especially if you, like me, have suffered with asthma before. First control your asthma (this is vital) and sleep on your back. This will ensure that the probability of the contents of the product staying on your face as opposed to being scraped away is higher.5) The directions instructs you to 'apply a small amount as a thin layer on the affected area...' Booooooring. I usually apply a liberal amount on the hyperpigmentation spots after each time I wash my face.6) Drink a lot of water. It does not matter what product you use, using them is only part of the battle. Your skin is like a child, you have to constantly tend to it by hydrating it. I drink so much water, my urine is more clear than the polluted tap water I drink.7) Think also about purchasing a sunscreen like AMBI (Skincare Even & Clear Daily Moisturizer with SPF 30). It's a legit sunscreen that also evens your skin tone, so that should complement this product, when you're looking to go outside. It also contains vitamins C & E (which are important for the skin) and it's also recommended by the Skin Care Foundation.8) For the guys, shave your face at least every other day. The facial hair catches the product as opposed to the skin, so applying this product on a face that has facial hair is not as effective as it would be if your face were smooth and free from any facial obstacles.9) Lastly, you MUST get sufficient sleep (at least 8 hours worth). Sleeping rejuvenates both your body and especially your skin. I've had episodes where I washed my face, coated it with facial products and then woke up some hours later, horrified with what was staring back at me. I didn't allow my body and skin enough time to relax and recover.It annoys me when people rate products on here and yet don't explain in details why they graded it the way they did. I rated this product four stars out of five due to my perception of this product working properly. The reason why I didn't award it the full five stars is because this isn't a perfect solution. You do have to give it time to work. Also, I'm not convinced that this alone will lighten your skin and diminish the post-acne marks. This is only one part of a larger process that should include both natural and supplemental means to enhance your skin's appearance, from drinking a sufficient amount of water daily to eating healthily to using other (hopefully safe) even-toned/lightening skin products when you're not utilizing this one, to getting a sufficient amount of sleep, etc. So this alone won't do.The company recommends that you use it for 3 months and discontinue use if you see no apparent results. Most people aren't going to wait 3 months, let's face it. We live in an instant-gratification era where we want what we want when we want it. And here, we want to see results and quickly. Use this for 2-3 weeks constantly, like I advised above. Wash your face twice a day, apply this twice a day (if you can), leave it on for many hours at a time, sleep on your back (and get at least 8 hours), etc. If you don't think you'll be able to decipher whether or not your skin has improved, take pictures beforehand and use that as a measurement."
3128,1,"Works well on very dry skin_This moisturizer works well on my wife's dry skin.  She uses it nightly and it is not sticky or thick.  It goes on easily with a faint and pleasant scent.  With nothing bad to say about a moisturizer that works well, I guess this is a 5-star product!"
7271,1,"Great size bag!_Just got it in the mail and it looks great! Feels a little cheap but I mean it was $5. Overall, its a great size bag for someone whose on the go and has ALOT of stuff. :D"
6416,1,"If it fits, it sits!_These are nothing special, but they do work. Took me months to find them and I believe it's from a lack of desire to buy tiny plastic nail polish holders. thanks to the daughter they were found and purchased. The do the job, less change of tip overs and you can use all bottle size and shapes."
6228,1,Great eye pencil_This stuff is amazing. Glides on with ease without tugging your eye lids. Can be smudged to get the smoky look or if you apply correctly you can get a very clean line with it. Happy to have learned of Nyx products.
2719,1,works great_works great and at a great price on amazon. I purchased the bundle package and shared with other family members.  I love the smell of this lotions not to strong and light on the skin.
5893,1,"Yes. Thank you._The blue will pass for black, which is excellent. And the white goes on pretty nicely. Overall, I really like this pencil."
8570,1,"Fine at home unit..._First off, the box was missing the instructions.  I went on line and printed them out.Promo indicates that it takes 75 seconds for the unit to heat...no way.  Don't believe any hair setter is at heat necessary in such a short time.Indicator light...when ready to use, it should go from reddish orange to a white...mine did not.Now to some good news:1. There are plenty of rollers2. Rollers were comfortable and easy to secure with clips provided3. All rollers heat at the same time, but only 3 clips at a time...so the user has to add from the generous supply of extra clips as each is being removed and use them in sequence...thought this would be a true annoyance...surprisingly, it was not bad to do.After 10 plus minutes, or when heat dissipated from rollers in head, removed the clips and rollers and let hair cool, then finger styled and shook out the curls...a very nice soft look.As far as portability...no case is provided.  It is best as an at home unit."
9915,1,Great product._I spend A LOT of time in the sun so this product was a natural choice for me! I would most definitely recommend!
4004,1,Best Face Sunscreen ever!_I love this product. Such amazing sun protection and no smell or white face issues. It's tinted and blends nicely into your skin. I won't use anything else on my face.
8980,0,bring back the old product_Let me start by saying I really like the Olay/CoverGirl products and USED to love the concealer that came in the little pot. However this one is way too much of a loose liquid- drips and does not cover like the other one did and for some reason every time I used it my eyes burned terribly-I am not sure what they did to change the formula but I had to throw mine out and look for another concealer- I am sorry CoverGirl but this time you goofed-Bring back the other formula
8210,1,Pretty and Pigmented_Very nice palette for a evening or day look the colors are very pigmented and easy to use. This is my go to look for everyday!
6553,1,"Love Sigma_Sigma has been my favorite brand in brushes, all the brushes that I have are amazing and this ones I am just in love, I couldn't ask more :)the material is great and the way they work I don't have words to describe.thanks sigma for your amazing products"
5616,1,"Exceptionally relaxing soak_I am seven months pregnant and avoided bathing during the first four months of pregnancy because of some potential risks to the baby. But once I was past that sensitive stage and started becoming larger, the idea of taking the weight off with a relaxing bath started sounding more and more appealing. Obviously, it is important to me to avoid any unnatural chemicals in the bath, so the ingredients list of these bath salts was extremely appealing.Though I bathe regularly under ordinary circumstances using highly scented bath bombs from Lush, I was shocked at how much of a difference this lavender sea salt product made in having a relaxing effect. I'm not sure whether it is the lavender essential oil, or the minerals in the sea salt which is having such a great impact, but the difference between sitting in a regular perfumed bath and relaxing in a tub of this product was marked - all of my muscles felt more relaxed, I had less round ligament pain, and I had a better night's sleep on the evenings I used this.The packaging is attractive and would make for a great gift, it has a little opening to sniff the product on the back of the bag so you can smell it without opening it, and it has a square bottom so it sits upright on the shelf. It dissolves quickly and easily and is a great luxury product. This would make a great gift for anyone undergoing a stressful time in their life. If you're interested in reading about the benefits of using sea salt or essential oil in your bath, do a quick internet search for 'Mark's Daily Apple' and 'how to take a better bath' for links to some scientific studies that show the benefits of bathing with this type of product."
5003,1,"Nice combs_It's a sad world indeed when you need more than one comb to fix your hair.  But it is, in fact, true and since you need them you might as well get these.  They will do the job nicely."
4626,0,"Another waste of money...._You would think by now that I would learn my lesson about trying cheaper products to save money but ultimately get NO results.  This is the second brand I have tried that DOES NOT work.  The ONLY brand that works for me is LiLash and I am going to order another tube as soon as I am done writing this review.  Yes, Lilash does darken my eyelids ever so slightly but as I have learned, once you stop using it that issue goes away entirely.  Besides, I always wear some amount of eyeshadow so you don't see it anyway.  Don't settle for less........this stuff is junk!"
2227,1,perfume_was surprised by the aroma but I love it so much I use it daily for myself and it arrived on time and in great shape
6164,1,"great product!_I love this product and see a noticeable difference on the skin surrounding my eyes.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I don't like the pump- there is too much air and I end up squirting out more every time than I need.  I would prefer a different packaging, but overall, love the eye creme!"
463,1,"My mom stole mine_I bought this and loved it, and then my mom stole it. There are a lot of brushes that look like the Spornette brush, but all brushes are not created equal. The amount of give on the back cushion really lets the brush contour and smush to your head, making for a very comfortable blow drying experience. After my mom took mine, I just went and got a Conair one and it feels really hard against my head and doesn't have any give or conform to my head shape, so I'm ordering another one of these. Don't waste your money on other brushes like I clearly did. Just buy this one and be set for life!"
8170,1,"Beautiful!_I own several IBD colors and I love them all.  This color is bright, but not too bright.  Just right for the summer!  I will continue to order more colors!  Lasts a full 2 weeks and I am tough on my nails since I garden and run a daycare."
4094,1,"I've been using this for a while and I like this foundation_I actually mix this color with a lighter shade for my exact match.  I also mix in a little vitamin C cream (or sometimes vitamin E cream) as my only moisturizer, and this mix goes on smooth and has good coverage and staying power.  I use the lighter shade around my eyes to brighten them up and disguise circles.  Then I set with a loose powder. Some people say this foundation has shimmer, but I don't notice it."
9975,1,"Love this serum!_I'm at that age when I'm noticing  lots of fine lines, and my face has areas that are, well, saggy.  UGH.  Needless to say, I've been on the lookout for a product to help lift and moisturize, while preventing further signs of aging.Adovia Facial Serum  was just what I was looking for.  I have used another Adovia product before-the Dead Sea Mask, and my entire family loves it!  The facial serum is a favorite as well now.  It has a high concentrate of Dead Sea minerals and salt, as well as Vitamin C and Green Tea.  In fact, there are 21 essential minerals in this serum!Adovia Facial Serum is non-oily for deep hydration.  It gives an instant lift and anti-aging affects, delivering anti-wrinkle results over time.  I have been using it for a few weeks now.  My skin is soft and does feel tighter.  The serum is not at all greasy-it is light but packed with nutrients.  It just makes me feel better knowing I'm putting such great nutrients in my skin."
2636,1,i got it_haven't used this yet i bought this to mix with other oils for my hair but it did come on time
6780,1,"so useful_Every household should have one of these. Many more uses than just for makeup. Anything in a tube can be cleaned out completely when you squeeze the last bit to the open end and cut the other end off. If you still haven't used all the product, just put a clip on the cut end. I bought several as stocking stuffers for grown ups. A great little tool for so many uses!"
2713,1,"Good body wash_I've had this body wash for about 2 weeks now and overall i am happy with its performance. If your looking for a new body wash it is worth a try... Here are my notes/thoughts:->It lathers up nice and quick.->Doesnt make me itch or leave any other undesirable effects->Smells great, scent doesnt last more than half an hour after shower.->Easy to use (open/close) though it is quite big being 24 ounces."
9743,1,"Great light-weight product for voluminous, body-ful hair!_Was swinging between rating this product 3 or 4 stars, but decided on the 4. This is NOT a mousse. I got this product to try as an option to hair mousse, which I often use to style my hair and want the style to hold.First off, this is really light on the hair.  It comes out moist just like foamy soap suds and, unfortunately, that's how it feels like when you put it on your hair (one of the reasons I decided on the 4 stars). You don't need a lot and, similar to mousse, I find it's better to put it on the roots only or else it can weigh your hair down, especially if you have long hair (mine is shoulder length). I find this is best to apply on damp hair: if you put it on wet hair, it feels like you need to rinse it off, and if you put it on dry, it doesn't do anything except wet your hair. Once applied, through a couple of days of trial and error, I find it was best if I completely comb the damp hair through then blow dry completely.  Like I mentioned, I wanted this as an alternate to mousse. This product DOES NOT hold a style, BUT it does leave your hair very, very touchably soft and light and bouncy and wonderful smelling the whole day. My hair felt really light and full of body and volume. This volume lasts the whole day EXCEPT if you comb or re-brush or try to restyle your hair during the day.  And because it doesn't hold a style, when the wind blows, the aeriness/volume/body goes with it.  Also, it doesn't hold up too well in heat or humidity. I found this out when I was stuck in a meeting for 2 hours in an overheated, humidified room. It's still winter with below freezing temps where I live right now, so this product worked great. Based on that one day, I'm thinking this will make my hair fall flat when summer gets here, so my suggestion is not to use it in the summer.Finally, you get to notice that you might actually be putting foamy soap on your hair because when I took a shower after the first day I tried this, my wet hair felt like it had residual soap in it, then when I shampooed, my hair foamed up more than usual. So it took quite a bit of extra time to rinse off my hair completely.  Other than that, it really is a great product!"
4632,1,Great!!!_I love how this lathers and how great I feel after using it. This soap is WOW! I love it. I feel squeeky clean after using it in the shower and a little goes a long way. The smell isn't all that but it goes away and does not linge ron the skin so I like that as well. My skin feels softer:)
5815,1,"Light and non-greasy!_Loving this product so far - it's light, not greasy and virtually no scent. I use a lot of Burt's Bees products and have always been happy!"
8128,1,"Works great, no perfume smell, and not greasy at all._I have very dry, extremely sensitive skin and I'm allergic to synthetic fragrances. This face cream is a homerun as far I'm concerned. It has very little smell and no perfume smell, at all. Hydrates the skin VERY well for all night hydration and does not become greasy. The skin really soaks all of this up. As for the age-defying properties, my skin did feel a bit plumper and tighter after several nights of continuous use and I've not experienced those results with other face creams for sensitive skin, so I'm very happy with the results."
2145,1,"Works on dark hair!_I've used this product several times and am always happy with the results. I have dark brown curly hair, and I love coloring the underneath layers so you just see a pop of color. It turns out nice and vibrant! When it fades, it turns kind of an orangey color, but I like that, too, so I don't mind it at all, lol."
8117,1,"Good product, Redken is better_I usually use Redken products (from paste to hairspray to, well, everything).  I tried this because of the good reviews.  It is a good product, it does hold your hair, but it makes the hair look greasy.  Redken holds without looking greasy or dirty.  You can run your fingers through Redken hairsprayed hair and it moves, but it still holds and looks stylish and professional.  For your reference: I'm a person of Indian ethnicity.  So, what can I say?  Your mileage may vary."
583,0,too oily_I tried this stuff for several weeks and mostly it just made the skin under my eyes all oily. I saw no change in puffiness and discontinued use after about 6 weeks.The only nice thing I can say about this product is that it smells pleasant.
1584,0,Cheap_not a good nail buffer at all... They even tried sending me a replacement one but it wasn't any better not worth it at all
9956,1,Love non greasy face creams!!!_This facial cream is so moisturizing! I love how it doesn't leave my face feeling greasy or to thick. It feels great going on and you can feel the tightening! I can use it in the morning after a late night and it helps my under eye sagging disappear! I use it at night as part of my nightly routine and in the morning before my foundation!!
3228,1,"Satisfied :)_My boifriend recently got this shampoo and also the matching conditioner for me and I used it soon as I got it...im currently transitioning (9 months into it) and I have half curly wavy hair and half relaxed so when I straighten my hair I want it all the same texture, THIS PRODUCT DID EXACTLY THAT,soon after using the shampoo I knew my hair was becoming softer, the curly parts especially and the conditioner left me able to run my fingers thru both textures.after towel drying I applied my fantasia ic straightening serumto blowdry and it waz soo much easier for me to run my round brush thru my hair, after blowdrying I used the Organix FLAT IRON SPRAY which I love in conjunction with my andis flatiron...all in all this product is great and will continue 2 be by bi-weekly regimen for straightening my two-textured hair :)"
3239,1,"Wow! Impressive_I bought this to replace my 7 year old Conair which had a crack in the power supply and was overheating. I choose the Babyliss mostly because of the reviews and because of the low price. I was also considering the T3 dryer which was significantly more.I was very impressed with this one! I have very thick hair which is fine and used to take me about 20-30 minutes to dry. In 10 minutes with this dryer my hair was completely dry! It seems to run a little quieter than my old Conair and is a little smaller. The buttons are stiff enough that a little bump won't change the setting and I found the grip to be comfortable. On mine, the nozzle stayed on perfectly. It's got a long cord which could be convenient. The low heat setting does a great job of drying, and the hot setting DOES get pretty hot. I haven't tried the cool.Overall it's a very pretty and great working hair dryer!"
8993,1,"Great Customer service!_Shortly after I bought this product, I got an email from the seller making sure I had received the package and offering tips for use. I was highly impressed by this! The smell of this oil is heady. I can't describe it, but I LOVE the smell. I think the product itself works pretty well, but as this is my first experience with argan oil I don't have anything to compare it to. I have very thick hair. I find it works best when I let it air dry and then while it is still just slightly wet, placing 5 drops through it. I still have to use the flat iron, but drying seems to be faster. I'll also use a tiny bit for flyaways. I would consider buying again, but this one bottle will last a very long time."
9835,1,"A Winner From InstaNatural_I love the way this stuff smells. It's kind of earthy and dark.I've been using it on my skin, especially my hands, which are starting to develop age spots.  It has definitely faded them, and I'm pretty happy about that. I'm also using it on my scalp and face to reduce the effects of aging.The bottle isn't huge, but you use so little of it for each application that it should last a long time. The manufacturer does suggest that you keep it refrigerated.I'm a big fan of all InstaNatural products, and this one, too, is a winner.NOTE: I received a sample in exchange for a fair and honest review."
6549,1,Great for under eye concealer_Great brush for applying under eye concealer.
7673,1,Good_I liked this and most Wen products the best things in this set are the replenishing mist which even works on your face and the re-moist great for once a month and after coloring
9893,1,"Great product for any hair type!_I can't say enough good things about this shampoo. It is thicker than other shampoos I have used in the past, has a pleasant smell, and lathers nicely. It does an amazing job of leaving my hair and scalp feeling clean and moisturized without making it feel weighed down or oily. It is specially formulated for dry, itchy scalps - I do not suffer from this but I did see a noticeable improvement in how my hair feels and looks after using it. No worries about dandruff as it helps to regulate moisture retention and promote healthy skin and hair. I would definitely recommend this to anyone - not just those who suffer from dry, itchy scalps, psoriasis, etc. It's perfect for any hair type and you will see the great benefits of a high quality product.Disclosure: I received this product free of charge in order to provide an honest review."
4588,0,"Nothing great!_I didn't find anything great with this product. I used it mixed in with lotions(good lotions), and used it alone on my skin, and found nothing worth praising about. Just not a product for me."
3072,1,"Truly Wonderful_I had a flat iron already but it always left me wishing it would get just a bit hotter and glide just a bit more smoothly. Well, this HSI product does the trick. My hair is thick and while it's not coarse, it's not fine either. It can be a struggle to get all of it flattened on the sides and curled just right on the ends. With the HSI I have it smoothed out in mere minutes. I love it. If you have never owned a flat iron or if you have one but wonder what all the fuss is about, invest in this one. You won't regret it. Customer service was exceptional as well. My order arrived promptly and everything was as promised. Kudos to this stellar seller :~)"
3229,1,"Good Stuff_I use this product occasionally after I wash my hair. It provides great moisture, makes my hair very easy to comb through, and tingles my scalp (good for circulation). One reviewer mentioned that the product's consistency is too liquidy and I do agree with that. Parnevu's Anti-Breakage Treatment has a much thicker consistency. I would only use this product on wet hair prior to a roller set. It will ruin any dry hair style. May be good for smoothing down edges only. I can't attest to whether it helps with growth because I interchangeably use many other products, but I do like this one enough to purchase it again."
4544,0,"Sorry, no good for my hair!_I wish I had more success with this product like others did.  this product left my hair dry and brittle after using it. I ended up throwing this product, away."
8964,1,Love It._This is a very unique mask. It is a scrub so it goes on thick and it hard to handle at first. But once you get to globbing it on your face its simple. I waited about 7 minutes then scrubbed for 2. This is a 2 part mask and it leaves your skin super soft and supple. I love all Freeman masks and this one is one of their best.Not tested on animals either :)
1359,1,"Great Product_I received a sample of this product when I stayed at a spa and loved it.  When my husband saw it in the bathroom, he wanted to try it too.  (My husband is a very manly man)  One of his guy friends told him about how well it works without leaving the skin sticky or smelling like a girl.  Olay might be surpsised to find out they have a lot of guys using this and recommending it.I like it because it does a great job of moisturizing, doesn't conflict with my perfume and it seems to be faster than applying lotion after my shower.I've had a hard time finding it at my local stores.  After my sample ran out, I went to three or four before I finally located it at Albertson's.  I'm glad to know I can also purchase it from Amazon."
3562,1,"Good Product_Good product, hydrating and easy on my sensitive skin. I like the package and it does not open even when it's shoved in my back pack."
9201,0,does not look at all like the pic_Out of all the gelish colors I have purchased this one is by far the most disappointing. It is more of a dull bronze and nothing at all like a vibrant orange like I was looking for. Overall a boring color.
3639,1,"Working For Me_I am an African American woman.My hair was thinning due to stress,chemical use and perimenopause.Prior to using this product, I used hair Formula 37 for a month, then I used Hairfinity for 2 months. I've had good luck with all 3 products, although they affected my hair problem differently. With Hair Formula 37, I noticed a difference in the texture of my hair. It was much stronger. With Hairfinity,as advertised, my hair grew longer at a faster rate. However, since I was more concerned about the thinning areas of my hair, I thought I'd try this product. I have been using this product for a month and a half. I am pleased to report that the thinning areas of my hair are starting to fill in. I never ever thought I'd have hair at my hairline and temples again (I was getting a widow's peak). But it is filling in.I must admit that I also take Biotin. So, that could also be contributing to my success.I am going to continue using this product for six months (until July), as recommended. I will then update my review.I forgot to add that I have very dry hair. So I have noticed that I no longer have to put oil on my hair as often. I use only natural oils on my hair like, jajoba, castor oil, rosemary and lavender oils. Also, my nails have always been strong and grow very fast. So I noticed no difference there. I did notice that my thin eyebrows are getting fuller."
199,1,"Love, love, love it!_This tooth gel is amazing. I love the natural ingredients. I love that its minty like and not fruit flavored."
1774,1,Flawless_I ordered it cause I ran out of my first one. This is so light on the skin and leaves my skin looking flawless. I love it so much will deffinatly be re-buying after I'm done with this one.
4069,1,"Wow!_This product has simplified my daily shower ritual. It is so moisturizing, that I can skip moisturizer after, and skin still feels supple and soft. Love it, and recommend to all the lazy people like me, who would like to de-clutter their shelves, and speed up their daily beauty regime."
2820,1,"Good for that messy look, whatever._On the jar of Axe Whatever Messy Look Paste, you will find the following statement:'Fact: Girls don't like that crusty crunchy hair you get from gel.'Well, neither do I, which is why I tend not to use gel on my wavy, often hard-to-control hair. Axe Whatever Messy Look Paste doesn't claim to provide 'control.' Still, control is the objective, but in a way that is meant to hide the effort you've made to achieve it. In other words, this is for men who are vain but want to appear too cool to be concerned with appearing attractive. It's an attitude exemplified by the word that serves as the name of the product and which may be the motto for an entire generation: Whatever. Too bad they couldn't fit 'you know' in there, too.This product is pretty good if you want that somewhat wet look, and especially if you dislike that crunchy effect that most gels leave behind. I doubt it will enhance your appeal to the opposite sex unless you have appeal to begin with. But, hey, whatever.Brian W. Fairbanks"
7345,1,"Doesn't work in Hawai'i's sun, but gosh, I love this stuff_Let me first say I LOVE the smell and texture of this product! Oh, how I wish it worked better in our ever-sun drenched climate, but it doesn't provide enough protection when I'm working in the garden and sweating. The product is otherwise quite heavenly.Update: I've come back to add and edit my comment, because here's what I've discovered: I absolutely love this stuff. My skin loves this stuff. I wear it at night - nothing I've ever done before with a 'sunscreen.' But it's so hydrating and does not break my skin out like some heavier botanical products. So now I'm hooked. And what I've taken to doing is simply reapplying small amounts, especially to my face, throughout the day if I'm outside a lot.I can't believe some people have commented that they don't like the smell. But no accounting for personal taste, I guess. Mmmmmm. Love it."
3868,1,"Mirror, Mirror, on the wall...which shadow is blackest of them all?_This is the blackest eyeshadow I've found as of yet. You don't even need primer to appreciate its intense pigment (although I would recommend you use primer to extend the staying power of it if you tend to have oily lids). If you are familiar with MAC's Carbon...believe the words of other reviewers as well as mine, this one IS darker. The only drawback of this shadow is that it is VERY fragile...the powder will break up easily. But, for a shadow as dark as this...I can easily forgive the cheap texture. Its a keeper!"
5579,1,Great Products At A Great Price!_I have purchased Elma & Sana's argan oil in the past and I knew they had great products.  This is a great set at a wonderful price.  I first tried the Khassoul clay through Shea Terra and loved it's effect on my skin and wanted to try this because it included the rose water.  This leaves your skin incredibly soft but tight with closed pores and not dried out at all.  This is a fantastic way to get minerals directly deposited into your skin.  Highly recommend this set.  Thanks Elma & Sana!
4878,1,Looks great in my home_Loved this nail polish display. Looks great in my room. Keeps all nail polish at hand and organized. The acrylic used is quality.
9154,1,"Fills in the lines with a little tingle and warmth_I use this cream mainly for a noticeable crease/line in my neck. Somewhere along the way, I discovered this neck line and have using various creams and such to blend in back into my skin ever since. I've used the Bee Venom Mask for a few weeks now, applying it at night before I go to sleep, then again in the morning after my shower. It has strong fragrance that I can't quite describe. It's not exactly what I'd call a floral scent, but more of a clean soap smell.When applying it to my neck, it does seem to have a tingling/warming feeling that starts up a few minutes after application. My neck feels ever so slightly warm, almost as though it's about to feel irritated, but then doesn't. This reminds me of some lip treatments/glosses I've used that were meant to be plumping. After applying them, they start to single a bit, causing circulation to increase and the lips to get a little fuller appearance. This feeling of this Bee Venom Mask reminds me of these and seems to have similar effects. Over time it seems the mask causes fullness of the skin, and starts to fill in the lines.The cream is thick and in the ingredients it's mentioned that it contains Shea Butter (which I love). It comes packaged in a weighty frosted glass jar, with a shiny gold screw-top lid. It's a nice looking jar, that can sit on your bathroom counter top without screaming &#34;wrinkle cream&#34; to any guests who may use the restroom. It's packaged like a high end facial cream. Just be certain the first time you use it, to try it out before you have to go out. Since there is bee venom in it, you'll want to test it out and check to see that if the venom causes any irritation of your skin before putting it on and heading out the door. That way if you find it causes any temporary irritation of your skin, you'll know ahead of time.A sample of the product was provided for reviewing purposes."
4962,1,I love it_The brushes are so soft and they changed up the blush brush a bit. its slightly flatter and more feathered out. its fantastic.
3043,1,"Must have_I have been using Olay for years. I use the face wash, then toner then moisturizer and i get ENDLESS compliments on my skin. if only ppl knew i spent minimal amounts of money on this stuff. MUST HAVEtake care of your skin ppl !"
3766,1,cute_They are thin and small but cute. Worth the money since they are very inexpensive. Also ordered several other shapes.
6957,1,"Great_I love this product, it works for what I need it for. I am a DIY'er and I love doing my own nails and this is great for me. I put the lights together with ease and use the 120 second timer I just wished that it gave a signal at 60 seconds but all is fine with the nail lamp no complaints and I have had the lamp for a couple of months now."
4350,1,Great Product_Needed something to help nail polish and nail wraps to stay on my nails.  This is amazing.  This works so great.  Its so easy to use with no smell at all.  Will order again.
3295,0,"Overpowering smell_The smell of this is pleasant but a little overboard. I tried putting this in my hair before bed and couldn't sleep. Also there is a definite chemical feel to it that seems slightly toxic. If you are at all sensitive to chemicals, get the organic oil which is  much more pleasant."
9102,1,"Great Mini Minnie Polishes_This cute little set of nail polishes are adorable. In my opinion the Liquid Sand, Magazine Cover Mouse is the best. Its so fun and has a nice feel once it is on the nails. If you haven't tried any of these nail polishes then you must."
6031,1,"Works the best!_Have tried many different products and I like this one the best. I like it better than Deva's Ultra Defining Gel.  This one gives good hold without making your hair stiff, sticky or gummy or weighting it down.  Hair still feels soft after I &#34;scrunch&#34; it out."
876,1,"Smooth and lovely foundation but not magical! :)_Purchased mine at Sephora - that's why it's not showing verified purchase but wanted to review here.I was so looking forward to getting this foundation and I do love it. I had not been using foundations for years - just my bare minerals powder makeup over moisturizer and so applying this adds a nice coverage that then I apply some loose powder over it to finish it off. I do love the coverage, I love the beautiful texture, but I was still expecting more based on the rave rave reviews. I am still getting used to adding foundation and I've used probably a pea size portion to get as much as I would like all over my face. It is definitely a high end quality foundation, no doubt about it .... so a solid 4 stars and big love to Laura Mercier in general. I love her line of products. (especially the lip liner, ladies!)"
4809,1,"A Great Product You Can Feel Good About Using...I'm Hooked_I've been using Seventh Generation Dish Pacs for about a week now.  I do one load of dishes a day....ocassionally 2.  In the week that I've been using this product I've seen a drastic reduction in mineral deposit residue left in my dishwasher.  I have hard water so had been running vinegar and baking soda through a washing cycle every few weeks.  I don't think I'll need to do that as often now..if at all.  Time will tell.  Dishes are coming out just as clean and sparkling as they have been with my previous brand which was Cascade Complete.  Here's something else I feel good about.  On the back of the package it says:If every household in the U.S. replaced one pouch of 20 concentrated packs containing petroleum based ingredients with our plant based product, we could save 9,700 barrels of oil.  That's enough to heat and cool 560 U.S. home for a year.This product serves me just as well, if not better, than the leading petroleum based product.  I feel good about that."
5127,1,"Finally found the right shade for my pale skin_I have pale skin, medium brown hair, and hazel eyes. Blush is part of my daily makeup routine, because without it I look, well... pale and tired. I have tried many different blushes, but it is hard for me to find one that looks natural. I believe I found it with this one. I paired this with Maybelline New York Color Whisper lipcolor in Made-it-Mauve, and ALMAY Intense I-Color Shimmer-I Kit, Brown (both purchased from Amazon). It also goes well with Burt's Bees Replenishing Lip Balm with Pomegranate Oil, which has the slightest tint and just gives my lips a healthy look for casual days."
1683,1,"Hits all of the spots I can't reach on my back._This brush works great for scrubbing my back with body wash, as well as putting lotion or body oil on it after my shower.  The latter is especially important in the Winter, when the air is extra dry from heaters and such.  No more dry, itchy back!"
6375,1,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!_this product is perfect! My face  and my makeup looks so much more perfect! I am glad I went ahead and spent the extra money on this one instead of something much cheaper!
8541,0,"Worthless for Me_One requirement I have for conditioners --especially so-called Deep Conditioning conditioners-- is that they don't leave my hair a tangled mess.  To me a conditioner that can't help a little with the detangling isn't all that helpful.  It's not doing enough conditioning if you can't at least partially comb out your hair without using a detangler.Since my hair is long and tends to tangle I don't set my standards particularly high, and my go to standard is a regular ole Pantene conditioner.  On the Pantene Scale (which runs from 1 to 5 with Pantene being a 4), this Tresemme Platinum Strength Deep Conditioner Treatment gets a 1.  It basically is a negative influence on the appearance, and probably health, of my hair.  [Regular cheap dollar store Suave Conditioning --which I also won't use again-- is a 2 on this scale.]Now I will say that it didn't leave my hair feeling heavy.  No, in fact, after I detangled my locks were kind of fly-away.  So no residue, but also no assistance in the detangling process, and so  there is no way that I'm going to give up the Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner that I just started using, and which is a 5 on the Pantene Scale.Even if you have short hair like my daughter, I think you might was well buy a regular, less costly conditioner by someone else or even Tresemme.  No point wasting your money on this one."
1942,1,"This stuff really is a Miracle_I get my hair highlighted on a regular basis and have for many many years.  On top of that, I use a flat iron on it every day because I have naturally curly hair so my hair can get pretty damaged.  I have used TONS of different products to try and help w/the breakage and dryness and haven't found anything that makes me go 'wow,' until now!  This stuff works!!  I left it on my hair for a full 15 minutes before washing it off and my hair is now so soft and looks so much healthier!"
101,1,best ever_I am always on the lookout for the best mascara out there and this one is it! It's inexpensive and goes on so smooth and easy without having to coat and coat and coat.
7425,1,"Great for Colored Hair_This product works amazingly for colored hair.  When I first started using it, it made my hair so smooth and shiny.  Now that I've been using it for over a year, I think it's time to give my scalp a change.  Plus I no longer color my hair."
4681,1,"Good substitute straightener_I already own a Bio Ionic One Pass 1.5&#34; flat iron and I'm thrilled with the results I get from using it. The reason I still purchased this hair straightener is to work as a substitute flat iron when I'm traveling, as it would cause me major stress to travel with the Bio Ionic incase it gets lost in baggage handling or something worse! Needless to say, this straightener had to stand up to some very high standards since I'm used to the results of the One Pass which is truly a man made miracle!First off, the Remington S5500 looks good and heats up fast. The digital controls are easy to use and basic which is what's required anyway right! I did find that there was slight pulling when I straighten my hair, but it was minimal and didn't affect the results either. I did a side by side comparison of this flat iron and the Bio Ionic on either sides of a center parted hair style, and the results were very similar! I needed an extra pass with this straightener but that's a small price to pay- ofcourse it will take me a little longer than the usual 15 minutes it normally takes me to get my mid back length hair straight. (I have thick, long hair but have perfected the art of getting it straight quickly). A good heat protectant is definitely very important to use with this straightener because of the pulling, but otherwise its a great product for the price."
9667,1,Five Stars_AMAZING product. These images are so clear. I love them!!
2833,1,"Use them all the time!_I use these 109's when going for a bolder, more noticeable look, and #110 when I want a more natural approach.  Ardell lashes were the first I have ever tried and there is no reason for me to ever try a different brand.  With gentle care (follow the instructions) I have used and abused mine over and over before needing a new pair.  I also wear contact lenses and never had a problem with them.  They give my eyes that extra-sexy OOMPH!"
5425,1,"Absolute new favorite brand of lipstick_This is one of the colors I've been wearing lately and I love it.  I have light skin and brown hair, and this &#34;apricot&#34; is pretty true to what you would imagine for apricot.  It's between a light orange, hint of pink but not too bright like coral.  It looks really good on me in the spring or with springy type colors/outfits.  The lipstick itself &#34;Revlon Colorstay Overtime&#34; is my NEW FAVORITE. It's the first long-wearing lipstick that actually stays on for hours, including eating and drinking.  If I'm going out after work, I'll freshen the powder on my face and freshen lipstick color at that time, otherwise I'm good for an average day at work.  I like many of the other colors including Faithful Fawn and NeverEnding Nude.  I'm going to be trying out another few colors in the near future and will review those here on Amazon as well."
9807,1,"great multi use product_This does lots of things for hair...from detangling to protecting from heat.I've waist length hair, and rarely use heated products - life's too short to spend time faffing about with hair :-). I found this conditioner does what it says as far as detangling and leaving hair feeling silky and soft, and looking glossy without looking greasy. Its in a plastic bottle, and has a pump aerosol dispenser, so it can be applied directly to hair. I've been using it for about four weeks and the ends of my hair that can look dry, being older, look shiny and as good as the roots. I'm lucky in having &#34;normal&#34; hair, but this seems to be suitable for all hair types, and certtainly isn't in any way oily or greasy, so I imagine would help detangle even hair prone to greasiness without leaving it looking limp and dull. I've also used it sometimes between washes to help get morning tangles out. Its so easy to use, and helps stop hair from breaking..I'm not a patient person and tend to drag the brush through quickly.....I also like leave in conditioners as I'm a wheelchair user, one leg, and conventional conditioners can leave bath/shower slippery. That's not a good idea when you've only one leg to get out with. One slip and its ouch, broken bones - been there, done that and I'm anxious not to repeat it :-)"
2841,0,"Hate this nail polish_Hate this nail polish. It's too thick and very messy. It leaves weird dark lines on the nail after you've painted it (not when you've taken the polish off, it happens with the polish on.) I actually threw this polish out. I don't remember the name of the orange Brazil line polish but that one isn't much better than this one. I'm not thrilled with these polishes as you can see."
4242,1,It gives amazing waves._I would have given 5 stars however the lock on the barrel became jammed with the first use and I had to break it in order to use it. Other than that this product is amazing. I can completely style my entire head of long hair in ten minutes. The waves will last the entire day. This was worth the money even though I can no longer lock the barrel.
6387,1,Good with dark color._I love how soft the bristles are. They blend so well and it is my go to use when I need to blend out Dark colors.
9322,1,Great wrappers for gel polish removal_These wrappers work great and I was actually able to reuse them.  Not sure if I was suppose to but didn't have a problem with results.
9155,1,"A nice luxury cream_I've been using this Bee Nigma facial cream for about two weeks now.  I know that it's called a mask, but to me a mask is meant to be washed off.  This cream feels so good on my face, I certainly would not wash it off.Packaging:  It comes beautifully packaged in a lovely jar and attractive box.Consistency:  The cream is thick and creamy, so just a little goes a long way.Fragrance:  I was surprised to read in a few reviews that some people didn't like the fragrance, because I really love it.  I think it has a soft, almost baby powder like smell.  It's very mild though and dissipates quickly, so if you don't care for it for some reason, the smell doesn't last long.On the skin:  The cream feels light and smooth as it goes on and is easy to spread on the face and neck.  I haven't experienced any tingling at all.  It remains on the skin surface feeling moist for a few minutes, then it absorbs quickly into the skin.  It never feels oily or sticky.  I've thrown out perfectly good jars of face cream that left an oily or sticky feeling on my face, but this product does neither.  Hours later my skin still has a soft, velvety feel to it.Noticeable changes:  I've noticed that my facial skin has a smoother texture, and the fine lines around my mouth have plumped up a bit.  The pores around my nose seem to have reduced in size, and that makes my skin tone even out.  The biggest improvement that I've noticed is that my recent onset of 'adult' acne (I'm almost 60) has cleared up.  I've been battling acne in the nose area and around my nostrils for almost a year, and it has completely cleared up in the past couple of weeks.  I don't know if it's a coincidence or not, but I plan to keep using Bee Nigma and see if it stays away.The manufacturer provided a sample for review."
3094,1,Nice coverage_Like the easy of use and coverage you get with this product.  No high perfumes and a little extra will cover up some blemishes.
2649,0,not for me._It's just too messy and not quick to use.  Didn't like it at all.  Would much prefer to continue with BE and or BB cream.
4289,0,"did not work for 2c/3b hair_This totally dried out my hair and I have no idea as to why. I have tried it numerous times because I am pleased with this product line, however this is not good for me. The milk product seemed to suck out the moisture in my hair and I had to put oil and other hair lotions to soften it up. Sad but I will probably throw this out and waste my 9 dollars! Can someone have samples so that if it does not work for a particular hair pattern we dont feel like a loser for throwing it away???"
6126,1,Very vivid colors_These rhinestones arrived looking very much as they do in the picture.  The colors are very vivid and distinct.  The only issue is the static in the container....you have to be very careful when moving the container around because they stick to the lid very easily.
3248,1,"Perfect to use around bun_I have a bun dummy, so when I make a big bun for a special occasion, I use this twisters to hold it and they look pretty and hold good"
305,1,"Better than q-tips_I love these for cleaning up cuticles after a manicure.  The cotton ? is tight and has a nice point, no fibers smearing into the wet nail polish.  I am so glad I found these!"
6555,0,Defective_Unable to use it. The surface was uneven whichDoes not allow a correct transfer. Is going to trash I was not willing to exchange 5-6 dollars item waist of time and money.
824,1,"A good deal_Ordered this for my hubby. He likes all the different scents. So do I, because I can't keep my hands off of him! And, the price for the four was a pretty good deal, too!"
1093,1,GREAT_I love this product it is a great way to keep the face looking shiny and young. I love it!
1101,1,Smells great!_Got this for my husband for Fathers Day. It smells great to both of us! He said he can't wait to take a shower and spray it on! That means I did good!
1917,1,"Firm, soft hold_Motions Foaming Wrap Lotion worked very well on my rollerset. The foam held my curls very firmly and did not leave my hair hard or dry. My curls felt soft, firm and moisturized and held up very nicely. This product will be a staple in my hair regimen."
6862,1,"FAB Cutter!_This cutter cuts my nail tips perfectly. It's a good quality cutter. I got it within 10 days, so I'm happy with it!"
4472,1,"Makeup artist and backstage runway staple!_This is what models and makeup artists use -- it's a total insider industry product and I'm so thrilled I found out about it.  It's different from the typical cleanser/makeup remover because there's no need to wash your face after you use this.  You simply soak on a cotton pad, wipe and you're good to go.  I have extremely dry skin that feels tight immediately after cleansing and this is seriously the only cleanser I've used that does NOT give me that feeling.It has the consistency of water, no smell and does not irritate my eyes at all.  It gets rid of waterproof mascara quite well.  There is something about the science behind the 'micellar solution' that breaks down makeup very effectively with no residue or drying effect.This cleanser is nothing short of AMAZING; you will not regret buying it if you use any makeup at all.Update:  Amazon tells me I bought this product 6 months ago and I've still got about a quarter of a bottle left of the 500 ml.  I use it perhaps 5-6 times a week.  Very cost effective."
7827,1,"Love it_These wraps work great!  They were easy to put on the first time I tried them. (The people saying they're hard to put on or they are falling off, must not be doing it right, or just aren't very coordinated themselves to handle it.)  I did the same as what others suggested and just used five on one hand, then slipped them off, and slid them on the other fingers afterward.  Saves a little money that way.  I also left them on for a little longer than 10 minutes just to be sure it worked good.  The gel polish I had on (Harmony Gelish brand) lifted right up, off of the nail very easily.  Very impressed with the results.  I will NEVER soak my nails in a dish again!  Also thought these were way easier to use then cotton pads and foil."
5567,1,"Really nice brush; great value_This looks just like the Mason Pearson brushes that sell for over a hundred dollars -- I can't compare the quality since I don't own the MP one, but this one works very nicely. I feel like I'm pampering myself when I brush my hair at night now! I don't think it would work very well to style a hair-do, but for detangling and grooming before bed or after drying, this works great."
8615,1,"I'm Loving It!_The Nexxus Youth Renewal Conditioner not only smells heavenly but leaves your hair feeling absolutely wonderful.  Use this with the shampoo and you have yourself a really nice head of hair when done. I am happy that this isn't leaving a heavy build up on my hair after showering but leaves it soft, silky and with some life to it.  It shines and considering I'm graying and gray hair is hard to take care of this Nexxus product is a perfect match for my needs.  Cheaper than salon conditioners and I honestly think it works better."
6398,1,"Fabulous liner brush_I got this because I had not been able to find a good eye liner brush that didn't make me want to throw it against the wall. this one becomes TINY, so thin! Perfect cat-eye every time! Would 100% recommend it!"
9874,1,"The MOST AMAZING brushes EVER!!!_Let me start by saying that I LOVE makeup and that I am VERY glad I purchased these brushes! I was always told that brushes are what make a makeup application look flawless and professional.They are needed for blending, even application, good color transfer, and efficient use of makeup.  I have bought so many ...many super expensive from high end makeup brands ... I needed to replace them but I could not replace all so I got these ... I was soooooooooooo surprised!! AMAZING!!!The brush hairs are really soft and comfortable on the skin, and they &#34;hold&#34; the makeup well. The brushes are able to apply makeup very lightly and even heavily if the situation calls for it (which it did the other day, as I was in a wedding and needed to apply makeup heavier than I would in normal mundane situations). I am very impressed by the brushes' versatility. There's really no need to spend a fortune on any other makeup brushes. This set performs at the same level of super expensive brushes but only cost a fraction of the price (I would know, I have done lots of photoshoots in the past).  I give these a SUPER high recomendation.  I will buy for friends and buy more for me to stock up.  Plus I love the bag.  A+++++++This brush set is portable too - the black case they come in is very chic and perfect for storing and transporting the brushes. I'm going out of the country for a trip very soon and I am taking all of this brush set with me. Even though the brushes are all full-sized they aren't bulky so it won't take up any space in my suitcase. I was not expecting that feature, so I am pleasantly surprised!Great set. I definitely recommend it!"
558,1,"Pain relief_I often have painful, tight knots in my shoulders and back and I was ecstatic to give this homeopathic medicine a try. I sprayed it in my mouth the first few times I tried it but I didn't feel the relief that I was hoping for, so I followed the advice of other reviewers and sprayed it directly on my upper back and shoulders and I felt relief almost immediately. My husband who has been having issues with his knee has also experienced pain relief from this product. We will definitely continue to use this spray! Give it a try, you might be pleasantly surprised.....I was."
3300,1,Best Blow-dryer Ever!!_This is the best blow-dryer I have ever owned. I am African-American with coarse natural hair. This blow dryer gets my hair dry very quickly with minimal hair loss. The design is lightweight and easy to hold plus the attachments are perfect. I find the goldish color to be kinda nice in my opinion as well. The price is competitive and it is lasting me a while. Andis might be highly underrated like a best kept secret. Most people wouldn't expect something with such a low price to work so greatly! I love this and recommend it to everyone.
2268,1,"NARS Ita Long handle brush_I really like this brush, I use Only for contour on cheek hollows, forehead and neck/decollate. The hair is not as soft but has just the right amount of  stiffness to it, which I actually was hoping for b/c I am not using it for any delicate areas on the face, so I didn't want it to be too soft. Overall I am happy with it, got the one with the long handle, my only concern is that I hope it wont shed to much. Ive washed it and have used it for a couple weeks now and has shed 2 hairs...I hope it was just breaking in and it will stop now. :)"
4255,1,Five Stars_This is the BEST shower cap EVER!!! LUVS it!!!
5328,1,"Love it_These arrived a few days ago and I am truly loving them.They definitely keep my frizz under control and they also smell really great!I use just about the recommended amount for my shoulder length hair and what I have noticed is that although sometimes I think it's not enough, by the time my hair &#34;air dries&#34; I can't tell the difference of where I rubbed or where I didn't! It's like it totally works itself into the hair!Also, the cap design is 100% mess free!Couldn't ask for a better product!"
381,1,"The Best I Have Found_I have been using this bronzing powder for years and just now got around to reviewing it. It has a wonderful, subtle sheen, so it doesn't look flat and pasty, but also not too shiny. It's a beautiful brown-toned bronze, not orange (and my skin picks up orange very easily). I can't imagine using a different bronzer. This is the lighter version of the Nars bronzers, which is perfect for my fair/light skin. For darker skin, you would want the Casino color."
4630,1,"Yes!_This is a great shower gel!  I love it because it's all natural & organic & it's good for your skin.  I just ordered another bottle, but I still have quite a bit left in the first bottle.  It's never too early to reorder!  I would recommend this to everyone!  Thanks for a great product!"
6861,0,Delivery_Delivery was longer than expected item too small for it to have taken so long to get to me. I haven't used it yet but it dose not look like the picture at all it was all pink-as I chose it simply because I thought it was like the picture and it looks cheap in person. And its small as heck looks like something for a child to use. I will be back later to rate on the functionality.
5829,1,I love it!!!_I have tried many organic shampoo's in the market and thisone is the best out of all of them.Unlike most organic shampoos it cleans hair thoroughly.Has very nice and light smell (not too intrusive).Most important of all no harmful chemicals!!
684,1,"A classic cologne that always smells good_Cool water is a good scented cologne that has a fresh and crisp smell with notes of lavender, menthe, iris and musk. This brisk aroma  keeps me smelling nice all day long. This cologne is good for a everyday cologne or for a night on the town.  Keep in mind that as a EDT type cologne it doesn't last as long as a full cologne.I will say make sure you are buying for a reputable seller as there are lots of counterfeits out there and that could account for some of the bad reviews.A great price here for less than 30 bucks."
2785,1,"Great if you want cruelty-free_I have been into the YTC line since it came out in 2007.  I use all cruelty-free products, so this line has been a God-send.  I find this conditioner to be very effective.  It's thick and does everything a conditioner should do, and the yummy smell is a bonus (it reminds me of Cabbage Patch Kids from back in the day).  I am not sold on the matching shampoo, however, but that is a separate review.  If you're looking for an 'all hair types' kind of conditioner, this is a great one whether or not you require your products to be cruelty-free.  One suggestion is that they ditch the plastic cap on top of the bottle.  It's unnecessary and creates more waste.  Those little guys add up."
7671,1,"LOVE!!!!_this is amazing. I was initially worried due to other reviews and the menthol in the product. However I am so glad I tried it!!! The cleansing conditioner is AMAZING. My hair is better then ever and I will continue to purchase!! I do shampoo my hair once every 2 weeks to start over again and get a deep clean but I can honestly say the cleansing conditioner does infact leave my hair clean. I also had the itchiest scalp ever and this completely eliminated that problem! My hair and scalp feel amazing from using this product! My hair was dried out from using too much protein and with one wash my hair was back to soft an amazing thanks to this product.The refresh mist is amazing as well. This small bottle will last forever because such a small amount gives you the desired effect. It leaves my hair super soft and silky.The deep conditioner is great as well. It gives that extra boost. I dont see myself buying the full size of it though because you need to leave it on for like 30 minutes AFTER washing your hair which I do in the shower. So its awkward to get out of the shower  and then jump back in in 30 mins. But if you wash your hair in a sink or whatever I highly recommend the deep conditioner! Its great!And I love that its cruelty free!! Also if the menthol or any of the ingredients scare you try wen Kids, its allergen free Im gonna buy a few bottles to mix it up with my regular wen."
5508,1,"I's okay_After hearing so many people rave about it, I finally decided to purchase it for myself. The colors are all quite useful, heavily pigmented, and does not have a lot of fall out. I like the primer potion it came with and the brush was of decent quality. However, I don't think it's so spectacular that it justifies the price tag because I don't find the colors so tantalizing that I want to use this palette every day. If anything, I just like looking at this palette because I like the way it was made. It's a silly and superficial reason but I think the design of this palette is superior to most other eyeshadow palettes. I recommend buying this if you don't have a bunch of eyeshadow already laying around."
2445,1,"This stuff is amazing_I am actually shocked how well this works. I use it to wax my underarms, and it really is almost painless.  Almost painless waxing? Never would have imagined that. Price is great too. Big fan!"
3621,1,Great_Work really well. So glad you get so many for such a great price. Really great buy did exactly what I wanted.
4742,1,"Worth the extra money_I bought this to do my own nails with shellac. I spent a long time reviewing other lamps and ended up going with this one from CND. I liked the feature of the muliple timers that I can program myself. Multiple timers on top that are easy to use.I read in another review that one negative is that there are no instructions on how to set up the lamp; otherwise I would've been looking all over, thinking I was missing something. Once getting it open and getting the bulbs in, I was ready to go and love it."
2687,1,"A good, honest clean_Liquid Neutrogena is a wonderful facial wash for my whole family. My husband likes it because it is fragrance free. I like it because it removes make-up and leaves no tacky residue on my face. My two boys, ages 8 and 12, like it because it's mild and doesn't dry out their skin.Amazon has the best price that I have been able to find for this product. Getting it on the Subscribe and Save plan made the price even more affordable."
7444,1,smells great and smooth_I love the smell of this conditioner and it's smooth and effective.  Just a very small volume of the conditioner makes my hair looks shiny and smooth.  High recommend this product.
4448,1,"Great deep waver_This is a great deep waver. It heats up well, is easy to hold and waves my hair beautifully. It does not have an auto turn off so make sure you unplug it."
225,1,I like this cleanser_This is a good cleanser to clean my face. It is gentle and smells good. My face feels really clean after i use it. But most importantly it doesn't break me out.
5808,0,Orange is not in_Very little turns your skin orange even after exfoliation. Wouldn't recommend this unless you're going on stage as an Oompa Loompa.
7890,1,cute_you get very little in each container. they make very cute designs and they come in a good assortment of colors
5964,1,"beautiful color, easy product!_Make sure to purchase the entire HARMONY GELISH product line to make this polish perfect.  I have been using these polishes now for 3 months and couldn't be happier.  Make sure to follow the YOU TUBE video on HOW TO APPLY HARMONY GELISH POLISH and you cannot go wrong!  I constantly get compliments on how great my nails look.  I do not use tips, just as a personal preference.  I have told all my friends about it and some of them have already started using it with the same great results that I have gotten.  I am a full time mom, and I own my own business and I always wanted my nails to look great but did not have the time to constantly paint my nails every few days.  These polishes make my nails SUPER strong too which is also a BONUS! Just remember to take your time while applying it, and follow the step by step YOU TUBE video and you cannot go wrong!"
976,1,"Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging treatment._I used the older version of the Olay eye cream. But, they really have improved it.  I use this eye cream and their matching face cream over my RocC  day cream.  It has just enough slight coloring that it covers dark circles.  I use my little paddle to place the cream around my eyes, as you should never put your fingers into the jar. Certain germs can contaminate the entire jar, and cause it to go bad way before it's time.  GREAT PRODUCT.Fonnie"
4646,1,This is  a great concealer_blends easily and leaves skin feeling soft .Doesn't seem to accentuate  or settle into the fine lies around my eyes as much as other  concealers .I love that it self adjust to my skin tone which is very fair  and hard to match
4813,1,"Leaves skin soft_These are great, I was looking for an alternative to getting monthly peels and I hope these will suffice.  Skin is left feeling very soft, smooth, and nice."
5601,1,"Great product._I love these concealers. I use them for my under eyes, as I have dark circles and it does a wonderful job hiding and blending!"
3103,1,"My favorite powder!_The Physicians Formula products are perfect for my skin and this powder is my favorite.  I use it alone and it fills and covers just as a liquid makeup would, but without all that to clog the pores.  The tint of the Creamy Natural powder is also perfect for me."
6240,1,Works wonderfully_This product is wonderful for my hair.  The argon oil really penetrates the hair and does not leave it feeling greasy
713,0,"Bad eye cream_I dont know where the hype come from, but i am a 21 male, i use computer like 12 hours a day- a typical nerd and my eyes looks really bad, so i decided to buy an eye cream, since i am very good looking when i was a child,but now i am ugly, so maybe because of the eyes that make me ugly then i am eager to try this one, too bad i bought 2 of them,then it turn out to be disaster, i cant even look at me in the mirror, my dark circle is worse, and it also swollen, it also makes my eyes red and blur my visionWheni stopped using, then it back to normal, you cant believe how depressed i was after this,i dont want to sit on a computer all day long, i want to go out and mingle with people,i want to laugh with them, to be a normal person, but my face didnt allow me to, some night i cried alone, why was this happening to me? What have i done wrong to be so unfortunate like this? As a teen, i got acne and acne scar, my parents who are cruel also treat me with disdain, they are lookism so they hate ugly people, even if it is their son, i am from asia so parents have the right to treat child like beggar, because us children have to depend on them.Then with nothing to lose, i googled the best eye cream,and i foundDermalogica multivitamin power firm developed by national dermal institute, wow what a miracle, the dark circle is vanished, i look ten times better. I go to class and every girls in my class staring at me, twist their hair, smile at me,my crush is there, before totally ignore me, now cant take eyes off me. Ok this seem like a fairy tale, but for some person, having a beautiful eyes will totally change how they look,and luckily it is me, after years of being  a total dork, i am more confident now, i am dating the girl i have a crush on,Which just make me wonder how shallow people are when judging other by looks, but we have to accept it.So just ignore this roc eye cream, or if you still want to buy it, i have 2 nearly full bottle which i will sell for a very cheap price, anyone interested?Take My advice and buy dermalogica eye cream instead,even if it is expensive(40$)$ it worths every penny,and you can use it for 3 to 4 months"
7001,1,"WONDERFUL_Came early, none broken, as shown and hold up very well I do at home nails and these work through any condition, highly recommend."
7496,1,"Works Great!_Clear Scalp & Hair Ultra Shea Oil is great!  It really does instantly soothe and nourish the scalp for quick relief from dryness. Can be used on wet or dry hair as often as needed. Provides light, non-greasy nourishment to scalp & hair and has a light fragrant scent that will not clash with any other perfumes, etc. Formulated with Nutrium 10 Moisture Lock system, a rich blend of shea butter and natural oils, including vitamin E, sunflower, coconut, almond, soybean, argan, and palm.  Tip:  this product also works great as a cuticle and fingernail treatment."
3140,1,great_Item as described new in package big bottle worth the price and it makes our hair very soft love it!
1863,1,"Love this deodrant_Been buying this for a while and love this deodorant from Dolce & Gabbana and would recommend this to anyone, cause it keeps you dry and I love it....."
6985,1,"Good eye shadow_I like this eye shadow it has a nice sent, ok pigments,it could use some more pigment so it shows up a little better but does give a nice natural look."
4384,1,"Silk_Lady's if you are natural or not you should always sleep with a satin or silk bonnet or a satin or silk pillow case, and the same things for your hair as we'll, too keep up with healthy hair living I change out my hair tie too satin or silk  scrunchie or satin hair ties. You will see a change in your hair.Recommend it."
2881,1,"Different packaging!_So it doesn't appear to be this exact version. Mine showed up in with pale pink/orange lettering. It appears that the Essie sticker on the front is a duplicate/copy as the E is off centered and the name of polish &#34;Good to go&#34; is in smaller print than the original and the original does not say &#34;top coat/finition&#34; under the name of the polish. It still does the job, though I think there may be a slight difference between the two in quality. However, Essie's fast dry high gloss is the best!!! So if this is a diluted version and it cost me 40% less than the original...I'm &#34;Good to go!&#34;"
4422,1,NYX Rocks!_I'm addicted to makeup and had to have these lip pencils. I loved the variety of colors in this group. I sometimes use them as a lipstick- really to hide the pigmentation of my lip color and I was worried that it would not be pigmented enough and boy as I wrong. I love these and will buy more!
7373,1,"I am in love_I am so in love with the brush!  It is the perfect combo of soft, firm and dense.  I use it daily for applying ERA FACE spray on foundation and spray-on blush (just spray onto a bit of tin foil and stipple onto face), as well as for contouring.  I love how dense the bristles are, but the brush hasn't proved too difficult to clean.  I am definitely a big fan!"
6995,0,"Brushes seem okay, the case smells like chemicals or paint_These brushes seem about as high quality as another set I bought for a similar price... not like I was expecting terribly high quality for the low price...! BUT the case smells so bad of chemicals (like nail polish remover or paint) that I was afraid to keep this indoors with my parrots (birds are extra sensitive to chemical odors). I'm sure it will air out in my dusty workshop, and I don't intend on using the case anyway.If you intend on storing these in the case they come in, and are bothered by strong smells, don't buy this set."
394,1,"Great lotion_Loved this lotion.  I saw it on a show on t.v. and bought it to try it out.  I think it smells great, feels great, a little goes a long way so the price is not so bad under those circumstances.  The price is a bit much but when you only need to use a very little bit for a great feel and coverage, the lotion will last a loooonnnnnnggggg time so I don't feel the price is too much for that reason.  I will be purchasing this lotion again and again.  It is wonderful and makes my skin feel soooo very soft and great."
871,1,Smells great_Loved how it arrived on time. This is one of the better colognes out there in my opinion if sprayed on the right guy.
8968,1,"Works well and I like the fact that it is natural ingredients._This is a really good sun block. I have been trying to find a good natural sunscreen and this one is pretty good.  With the natural ingredients, though, it seems to separate in the tube, as others have noted.  At least I am guessing it is due to the natural ingredients.  Still it has done a decemt job for me as I live in Phoenix and need to have a good sunblock as I have fair skin and tend to burn easily.The price is a bit steep, in my opinion, but then most natural products cost more to make.  Still it is the best natural sunscreen that i have tried."
7931,0,Not very good at all._These were all dried out when they came to me.  Not happy. I can't even refill them.  I will know better next time.
3123,1,I love this file!_Never going back to emery boards ever again! This makes the edges of your nails so buttery smooth.  I wish I had bought one sooner! This is a purchase you won't regret.
4502,1,They are nice_Their a bit small for my head but it stays on at night so I can't complain. I like it.
1823,1,Beautiful Overshadow/transition color_I bought this on a whim. I love theBalm products.  I'm so glad I got it! Over a purple shadow it will make a matte a shimmer. If you spray it with fix+ it makes shadows look almost like duo chrome and when I'm being lazy and don't want to blend like I should it's a great transition color that blends the colors together.  A must have in any makeup  bag/collection.
7495,1,"A little goes a long way._As with any oil in general, you are going to want to use this very sparingly. The lack of instructions is a fail on behalf of CLEAR SCALP, but since I normally use hair oils, pomades, shine treatments, etc, I pretty much knew what to expect and how to use it.If you have really drry scap issues, put a drop on your pointer finger and rub it in a little against your other pointer finger, then apply it to the areas where you need it and rub it in. You shouldn't have a thick layer applied or a puddle. It should only feel very slightly slick. If you use too much, you will have an awful mess. Do not just squeeze the bottle onto your head! lol You will regret it.You can also use it to help tame frizz, give some added shine, and hydrate/seal really dry/split ends. Again you only need a few drops though. Put a drop or two in the palm of your hand, rub your hands together and then sort of grab just above the ends of your hair, and slide your hand down to the end. To tame frizz add a drop or two to the palm of your hand, rub hands together and sort of run your hands over your hair and then finger comb through it. Same technique of you just want some shine or sleekness.This 3 ounce bottle would last months and months. Again the main thing to remember is literally a drop or two at a time or you will end up with a major case of the greasies.It rinses away easily with any shampoo. You may want to massage the scalp a bit more to really get the shampoo on to it and to exfoliate the dry skin you were treating. I typically kinda scratch at the scalp when I am shampooing as I am lathering. I have had no issues with this oil being hard to remove and I haven't had any buildup on my hair or scalp. I am caucasian with long wavy/curly hair which can tend to be on the dry side depending on which styling products I use and how often I use heat tools.The oil is also great for braiding and for straightening with a hot iron.While I like the results while the product is in/on my hair, the benefits are gone once it is shampooed out. It doesn't seem to have any major permanent reparative qualities, but that is expected from a low priced brand like this."
621,1,so far so good_I really like this iron. the only problem is it is big which makes it hard to handle it. it doesn't make your hair curly. it gives nice loose curls. .love it!
2100,0,Not worth it_Let me begin by saying that I Love Frownies. Use them religiously every night.  And they work.But this product is a waste of money. You can go out and buy any brand of toner to get the same results. Cleaner face.Don't waste your money on this - buy Frownies instead.
780,1,"Effective, not greasy_I have used this eye cream for 4 years now and I am very happy with it.  It does a good job of smoothing fine lines and absorbs well. I also have sensitive eyes and this product does not bother them. I highly recommend the PCA line."
3634,1,"Great color_I love all Opi polish.  It is a very pretty color and goes on smooth.  It lasts well too, especially with a topcoat."
5277,1,Good Mousse!_I use this when I wear my hair curly. It adds shine and it does not get crunchy. The scent is great like all of the argan oil products have.
9628,1,Excellent derma roller_This is an improved derma roller. It really opens the pores and feels good. I believe it can help one's skin a great deal if used gently every day or every other day.I washed this derma roller and let it air dry. It seems that it will last a long time.One possibility with a derma roller is to use it along with a skin serum. I know people that do that.Derma Roller provided by Royal Derma Roller.
2216,0,"Peels off, Strong smell_I bought this product after reading all the fantastic reviews to use over my OPI nail colors.This top coat peels off like scales of a snake in a few days and smells awfully strong :(I am not a professional manicurist so, maybe there are special ways of using this product?Anyway, will not buy again.. I will just stick with my Loreal top coat.."
3006,1,Wonderful stuff!_This made my type 2B curly hair look beautiful. People compare it to a mermaid's hair. This is the best product I've ever used for my hair!!!
4550,1,"Works nicely_I have older, dry but sensitive skin, and often the products for dry skin cause me to break out. This cream was light and non-greasy, and gave me soft skin without making me break out. I used it morning and evening without any negative side effects. Worked well. I'm going to look for it after I finish this sample. The only negative is the scent which is sort of citrus/medicinal. Not terrible, but it's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars."
7901,1,love this._I definitely find this scissors very sharp and I also like the way I can adjust it. I use this to cut my dog's hair and it is small enough to move around without worrying if I cut too much off or if I'm messing it up. I recommend these for anyone who wants to save a few bucks on dog hair cut.
6851,1,"Takes some playing with_These aren't really easy to use. It definitely took me some practice- scratch that- a lot of practice in order to try to get these to work for me. I don't know if it is just my hair texture and thickness but it didn't really work that well for me, and I don't really have thick hair. However, when they do work, my hair looks cute! My friend was able to get it to work for her wavier hair, so it seems that more textured hair works better with these.A good note though is that these shipped out suuuuuuuper quickly! Like, I got it like 2 or 3 weeks earlier than the predicted shipping date :)"
2666,1,"Surprisingly good..._...compared to my Infrashine, which in my opinion, had been comparable to the 1 inch CHI for years. I've loved the Infrashine, and have always felt that it is less damaging to my hair than the Conair or others available in the supermarkets and department stores. I can't decide between 3 star or 4 star, but based on my experiences on reviews, 3 stars meaning I probably won't use it much at all and 4 stars meaning I would use somewhat often, I gave it a 4.I have naturally wavy (at the end) black Asian hair. Somewhat thick but the salon stylists I've talked to said I have 'normal' hair. I normally use my irons at around 350-400 degrees.I was very skeptical about the Wahl Pro. It arrived with obvious signs of use and some scratch-looking marks on the plates that I could not clean off, so I was a bit scared to use it, but decided I'd try it on a little bit of my hair to see how it goes (after cleaning the whole iron). It also doesn't come with any manuals, but I am not sure if that's just the one I got or all of them.I don't like putting any styling products on my hair so I didn't even bother trying the conditioning strip, especially after reading some of the other reviews about how it doesn't seem to make a difference. I did, however, use the comb attachment, which I LOVED, to my surprise.The comb attachment makes straightening the back side of my head EASY. In the past, I've always had a terrible time with the back of my head even with the expensive irons, because my body just wouldn't contort that way and my straightening job would always be pretty bad in the back because I couldn't run the brushes straight so it would often be uneven and crooked. With the comb attachment, my hair is straightened more evenly and it SEEMS to do a good job. Just make sure you brush your hair BEFORE using that attachment. I don't think it's meant to brush it for you from the start, just to keep hair in place.I am not sure how good it is for my hair though, because the quality doesn't seem nearly as good as my Infrashine. The ceramic plates don't close all the way flatly against each other (the tip end of the iron closes but the handle end doesn't, leaving a very obvious gap, which I think would cause the heating to be uneven). I am not sure what Tourmaline technology is though... my Infrashine never had it and the nice CHI irons I've seen never had it either.I would still use my Infrashine over this one but if I really want to straighten the back of my head, I would use this iron instead. At this price point, I think it's a worthy purchase. Not so sure without the attachment though. Although one down side is it DOES seem to DRY the tips of my hair more than my Infrashine. I do not like that part at all."
7951,0,"Smears like crazy_The color and ease of use of this product are good, but I swear, 5 hours later I touch it and it smears all over like I just applied it. Very disappointed. Who wants to use this for a winged liner if you accidentally touch your face and it gets everywhere??"
8137,1,Makes my skin feel so nice ..._I love all of the Olay products.  This one made my face feel so nice and velvety smooth.  Hope Olay continues to make this product.
7842,1,Love it!_I bought these to use as arts'n crafts purposes for my young kids. There is only a tiny amount of them but what do you expect with the great price?!!!
4462,0,"Fail_I'm disappointed in this product. I am a Clinique brand loyalist, but I truly don't think this product made a single difference in my skin whatsoever. It's also a bit greasy and doesn't absorb into the skin very well. Applying foundation over it is quite tricky, even when waiting 45 minutes. I do not recommend this stuff."
1191,1,"Eyes look great!_This kit is really easy to use and I get complements quite often on how nice my eyes look. I can go out without any other makeup on, just having used the eye kit and I feel good about myself. A great product I will be buying more often!"
5518,1,Love it_I really like this brand of gel products.  I now buy them exclusively and find them to be easy to use and reasonably priced.  If I were to buy this in my area I would get a smaller bottle for the same price and I pay for the regular sized bottle.  I'm a fan of Amazon for sure.
4355,1,"Ok_While this shade has bronze in the name, I did not see any bronze in my hair when I used it. It was more of just a medium brown. I was ok with that. I just wanted to get rid of the dark dirty blonde hair that I naturally have (and hate lol).This dye covers well, rinses easily and did not seem to be very harsh at all on my hair. It does not come with a conditioner packet, so I just used a salon brand after color conditioner that I had here at home.I typically need to use 3 bottles of dye at a time because my hair is so long. So, it was perfect that Amazon sells it in a 3 pack and it was on sale for a ridiculously low price. I got all 3 for less that what it costs for 1 at the store.With this dye, I only needed 2 bottles and there was a little left over. I am not sure how that happened because the bottles seem to be the sam size as other brands, but I am glad I could use less. I think the mixture is just not as thick as some other brands, but it is not watery either though.The color started to fade within a week and a half, but I find that to be typical of any dye, for me. Needless to say, I am now back to the dirty blonde and need to color again.All in all, I would recommend this dye. It is cheap enough and it worked well for the price range and did not damage my hair (that I could tell). With some brands, you can tell an immediate change in the texture of your hair  - it can get dry or just feel rough and damaged. This one seemed more gentle."
1785,1,Best toner_This is the best toner on the market.  It cleans your face thoroughly after washing it.  The service from the company is top notch and reliable.
3110,1,Simply nice stuff_This is really a nice product.  I use it as a base and really don't feel that I also need powder.  I just really do like L'Oreal products and this one is another hit for me.  Recommend that you buy this one.
6593,1,"Great_These Q tips cotton swabs with the &#34;precision&#34; tip are wonderful. I wasn't sure i it would make a difference or not, but it did."
8016,0,"Pretty upset!_I was upset because this color looked more burgundy, but when I got the gloss, it looked pink and I don't like pink, so I believe this color is unrepresented. This is not the right color I gotten!"
5180,1,Great Cosmetic Product_I liked that there wasn't a waxy feel to the brows when using this product and it didn't affect putting on eyeshadow. It worked all day!
9433,1,"I LIKE THIS, BUT..._I was a fan of a previous version of this, but hadn't been able to find it in stores for a long time so I was glad this came out.Red dyes are notorious for fading so I hoped this new product would work like the old and help counteract this. It does. The color boost is subtle and builds up over time, so if you expect to see a big color boost with one application- don't. This does not work like a dye so to expect it to do what a dye does is unfair-it will not radically change your color or cover grays. It will help keep your bright red hair from taking on that dreaded pink faded color.What it will do right away is give your hair an excellent shine. The day I used it the first time I had 2 comments about how shiny my hair looked.My complaint is that every time I use it, no matter how hard I try to keep it off my scalp and how thoroughly I rinse, I get some magenta spots on my scalp. To solve this I make sure not to apply it near my part or hairline.  Which defeats the purpose somewhat. I'd give this product 5 stars if not for that."
5375,1,"So much GIRL fun!!_My daughters and I love to explore the world of nail and makeup products. We always have a great time together while sharing new products. We can spend a whole day making each other beautiful. The NAIL Art Polish Manicure Image Plates were so much FUN. They worked perfectly, instructions were included. We applied them on acrylic nails, stick on nails and real nails. Had no problem with any of them. We applied them and finished off with a top coat to make the Pop. FUN for every day of the week."
8906,1,hair clip_I purchased a few different ones and one is more beautiful then the other the colors are gorgeous and the price was so cheap thank you
2597,0,"Possible counterfit_This product does have a beautiful smell, and as a fan of rose and Bvlgari I thought &#34;What can I lose?&#34; urns out the thing you loose is the fragrance after only an hour. Disappointing the scent practically rubs off."
5033,0,"Sadly, it didn't help me at all..._I hate having to post a negative review of something I had such high hopes for.  I had wanted this (or a similar, more expensive version of this) for many months before I purchased it.  I really thought it would help my skin, which has a hard time exfoliating itself now that I'm in my mid-thirties.  However, it broke me out BIG-TIME!  It couldn't possibly have been just a temporary purge, because I was getting clogged pores in places I never get them, like on my temples and above my upper lip.  I had to stop using it.  I'm glad it works for so many other people, though--it's nice that there's an inexpensive cleaning brush out there for those of us who can't afford to spend hundreds on one.  And I would have been severely upset if I spent that much on a brush that wrecked my skin.No worries, though--I find I'm getting super-clean skin and great results with my Aqua Glycolic toner.  And I've recently found another product for adult acne--Clearasil Adult Daily Clear, with resorcinol and sulfur--these two products seem to be doing what I hoped the Olay brush would do for me."
8990,1,"The best serum_I am so happy with the results of this serum. Who wants to spend money with Estee Lauder or other expensive brands when this one is AMAZING, When I use it at nite next morning my skin is glowing. This serum is very thick consistency so what I do is I spray my face with organic rose water and later the serum so I don't have to over use it after I apply the Bel essence intensive anti-aging treatment  nutrition for the skin and thas my fountain of youth!!"
5722,1,"Great color for winter_I really do love this color. As is true with most Gelish colors, the shade of the nail polish does not match the actual color on your nails. That said, it is a really pretty and unique color. It is a deep grey that looks purple in the right light. There are also very subtle purple sparkles in it that you can see in sunlight. It's one of my favorite fall/winter colors.For some reason, this shade does come out a bit thicker than some of the other ones. You could be fine with just one coat, but I usually do two anyway (see picture). Be sure to make your coats extra thin.Finally, even if you do get some rippling, don't worry about it. Put your topcoat on and cure, and it should come out smooth."
7243,1,"One word love_This oil help your hair to be soft easy to manage your hair, right now I'm in the process of creating my hair care line. And this oil as we'll as other are the reason why my hair line is going to be different from other.Run and get this oil. Your hair will love you for it."
8931,1,Give your same old color a different look_Whether it's to the whole nail or a mock french manicure I really like this product to change it up!
602,1,Minimal hair pulling_I read that natural brushes were good for your hair health and I'm glad I tired this one first. It glides through my hair and doesn't seem to pull it out. Other brushed I would have clumps in the brush. I use a wide tooth comb when my hair is wet didn't test on wet hair. But on dry it cuts through my thick hair. And is great for hair drying.
9887,1,"Not just for baby, Baby._I figure that any product that they formulate for the delicate skin of a baby would be great for my delicate skin. I was right, this is an excellent light and non-greasy moisturizer that really works as well as some of the more expensive stuff. I'll be buying this when my Vine bottle runs out, even without  baby.."
2887,1,"Worth every penny_I have this in the fair/light.  Because I have a shameful tendency to fall for 'new' products, I rarely need to repurchase makeup.  I have now purchased this product twice and it is worth every penny.  It is a loose mineral so it should last forever, right?  Well, I have two teenagers in the house who use it daily to hide whatever bump they've awoken to find residing on their face.  One is a boy.  Shhh, don't tell anyone.  This concealer looks so natural people think he has escaped the cursed teen acne and has been blessed with my blemish free creamy skin (ha! I use it too).  We don't tell anyone.  He'd just die from the embarrassment.  The best thing about this product, from a sanitary point of view, is the fact that it is a loose mineral and that we all use our own brushes (which, of course, I have to clean every darn day because they're teens and they can't be bothered) so we aren't creating a bacteria laden stew that can easily happen when sharing creamier cosmetics.  This product covers without looking fake in broad sunlight, it seems to 'melt' into your skin, the color is a perfect match for our pale skin and it is gentle enough to put directly over teen acne without exacerbating the problem.  It also does a decent job of covering dark circles but if you've had a rough night you'll need to layer it.  A fabulous product that does what it claims to do."
3900,1,Bright Colors_The absolute best product for the price! A lot of the colors have a lot of shimmer in them. looks great on my brown skin.
3312,1,"Gorgeous Lip Gloss! My favorite!_I had been eyeing these NYX mega shine lip glosses for awhile. I am so glad I bought this one. It's perfect for my everyday look. Also great over one of the NYX soft matte creams if you do want them to be less dry and a little less matte.I wear lip gloss all the time.  This is my favorite!  There is shine in this shade but no shimmer.  It's a lovely shade if you like the natural look but don't want your lips to look washed out.  The little bit of brownish pink is lovely- looks very natural. It doesn't last all day but I think it wears well for a gloss. Also not totally sticky unlike some others I've tried.Simply love this and will buy an extra to keep in my purse.Also there is a *strong* cherry scent in this gloss. I don't mind it but just wanted to make sure buyers were are of it. Also, you may want to use a lip liner as I think it makes this look better (and last longer)."
6353,1,"Best of the best!_Plain, and simple! I have yet to use an Eminence product which did't work. If you're looking for a healthy, and effective alternative to clean your skin, you can't go wrong with the Acai Cleanser."
4463,1,"Watch some tutorials to get this to work right_I've had this for about a year, and bought it when my hair was a bit longer than my shoulders.  The included instructions weren't helpful at all, so this sat in a drawer until I recently dug it out and decided to give it another try.As other reviewers have mentioned, if you check out some tutorials online or follow the instructions that other reviewers left, you'll have better results.  It takes me less than a minute to make a pretty bun or updo with this, and it holds my fine, wavy, mid-back-length hair in place really well.Just play around a bit with this and have fun with it!  It's great for casual and even more formal updos!"
4661,1,"Mixed feelings._I've never tried a gel moisturizer before, but thought I would give this a shot. After using it alone a few times, I decided to apply a lotion to my face first because it just wasn't giving me enough moisture. However, my skin is pretty dry these days since it is winter and I will probably use this product without lotion in summer. I feel like the gel definitely 'locks in' moisture and leaves my skin feeling smooth."
8666,1,"Very nice product, but doesn't make your hair look like the model's on tv!_The commercial for this shampoo cracks me up.  Wonder why mine doesn't look like hers?!  Anyway, as far as over-the-counter shampoos for fuzz-heads like myself are concerned, this one does well.  No, this, or really any other shampoo will not completely get rid of the boxwood bush look, but it helps somewhat.  You can actually feel it soften your hair while it is still being washed!  It isn't 'soupy' feeling, just a bit more hydration.  It doesn't add a ton of oil, which was what concerned me, but just softens it enough to keep down the fuzz.  Nothing replaces a straightening iron but this stuff does well enough to make my hair stay relaxed for awhile after using the straightening device.  It does, however, make me wash my hair a bit more often, say by a day, but for the conditioning qualities, I'd rather wash it more often then have a head full of straw.  But, I do prefer Clear's new shampoo, Frizz control.  I think it does a much better job of controlling all of the extra 'fuzz' on my head, particularly in the warmer months.  This Tresemme doesn't do as well in the warmer months - I'm still a fuzzhead and would only have to spray my hair green to fit in with my neighbor's boxwood hedge.This smells better than boxwood too.  Recommend, but with the above exceptions."
2892,1,"This light is great!_I didn't buy this light through Amazon, like the other reviewer I bought it at a store in town for a great price so I figured I would give it a go.  I had been looking at the Baby Quasar versions but they were so dang expensive!  I am 35, have pretty good skin (never was into tanning thank goodness) and have some fine lines starting to show.  LOL not acceptable to me, people always say I look like I'm in my twenties, and I plan on staying that way for as long as possible!!!So, I am a total beauty product junkie, I have to say I love this light!  It's very effective, I can already see results in my skin!  I have been using it morning and night, Monday through Friday.  So, I've just started on my second week.  I am REALLY hoping that it will work on my under eye circles... nothing yet, but I am very optimistic.So, here are the pros - you can tell an immediate improvement on your skin - it's softer and just looks better...Also, you can put the light right on your skin which is nice - I think it would be annoying to have to hover over your skin.  Yes, it gets a bit warm by the end but isn't bad at all - I actually really like it.Ok, so the cons, it does suck that you have to move the light around - it is much more of a time commitment this way!  In a dream world - I'd love to get a face shaped version that I could just lay on top of my face and then lay back and soak in all those fabulous red healing rays... I'd take a whole tanning bed actually (but with the red lights, not tanning ones) - yes, I love it that much!"
6183,1,Loove the color_L'Oreal Nail Polish has never let me down and this color is amazing. Very bright and looks great on all skin tones.
9928,1,"Non-clogging!_I hate applying sunscreen to my face. They all feel pore clogging. My skin feels more sensitive and more prone to acne now. Started on this line for face wash, acne cream, and using this SPF 30 and it's working! This does not clog. I'm getting my sun protection. Does not feel greasy. Light weight. Smells good."
8166,1,Love it!_Shipped fast and I LOVE it. I have long lashes but this is my favorite mascara of all. It lengthens and thickens without the chunky stuck together look. I deinitely recommend!
6182,1,OMG love this one too_I love China Glaze product they are so great they look so beautiful on my nails they're super shiny and go on with one coat
3008,1,"Love this product!_I absolutely love this product.  I have purchased other face brushes before at high end shops at much higher prices, which have all left bristles on my face.  This one does not!"
4783,1,"i love this wand!_this is a great wand- i have used this several times and everytime i end up with pretty, full curls. i am so happy with this purchase and i plan to buy another with a larger diameter."
6257,1,"Love it!_Not only is it vegan, but beautiful too! I love the effect, the name is perfect for the color; blue, purple, and green depending on the light. My boyfriend even let me put it on his big toe. Dries fast and is lasting longer than my opi or china glaze polishes, hasn't chipped or peeled yet!"
7273,1,Cute!_Keep in mind these are MINI bottles so they aren't big at all! But the colors are gorgeous and the smell isn't as bad as its made out to be. I too am an asthmatic so I have to be careful about the vapors I inhale. The only reason this product got 4 stars instead of 5 is because the &#34;TLC&#34; color was leaking! Which wasn't cool but I cleaned it up and have painted my nails with all the colors! All in all a great buy and they came fast!
5454,1,"Read the Directions_This is for the ends of your hair only. Be careful not to get at the base, or scalp. You can also leave it in your hair, it doesn't need to be washed out, but if you add too much you will want to."
9122,1,"A good razor for a disposable one!_I would purchase this product again, mostly for travel purposes, but also for the bikini detail attachment - that little gadget worked better than I thought it would!While disposables aren't great for the environment, sometimes they do come in handy, especially when I am traveling and do not want to take along my regular razor.The shaving experience was nice - no nicks or pulling or cuts, and the shave was close and left my legs smooth. The bikini attachment allowed me to - um - make things nice and smooth and trimmed and all that jazz without hurting any delicate areas - teehee.All in all a nice little disposable razor. I would purchase this again."
7407,1,everyone's favorite!!_i show this palette to my sisters & cousins then latterly everyone was fighting over it plus it worked beautifully to each of our different skin tones!!
5741,1,"For the price it's amazing!_I love real Techniques brushes, I have several of them.  For the price point they are unbeatable.  I have even given them as gifts."
9869,1,Magic In A Bottle_This product is a beauty guru best friend. .you can subtitles this product as a moisturizer as well..makes your skin smooth and soft recommend by Dr.Oz it has vitamins that is also good for your face..
223,1,Very good product_use it morning and night and it leaves the skin feeling clean and soft.  You can put your makeup on over it with no residue.
3479,1,"Love the smell!_I love the smell and feel of this body wash. The scent doesn't last which I like so it doesn't interfere with any scents I use after my shower, but still smells great in the shower. It lathers nicely and does not strip my dry skin. Overall I really like this!"
9157,1,"Proponents Call Bee Venom the Natural Botox_This is a luxurious creamy thick face lotion with the most prominent ingredient being New Zealand bee venom and Manuka Honey. Be warned: Do not use if you have bee allergies!Proponents of bee venom say it is like a natural botox. Naysayers say bee venom is just the latest fad. At $130 for 65 grams, you just want to know, Does it work? The great thing is that the company offers 100% money back no questions asked within 60 days. That's fair, you can give it a try and see for yourself.I have been using Bee Nigma for 2 weeks now. Applying this lotion there is a slight tingle. Bee Nigma recommends leaving the lotion on for at least 20 minutes. I leave it on overnight and reapply in the morning. It has a wonderful honey rose sort of smell, not over powering.The results? I have premature deep lines around my mouth that I have wished would magically disappear. I think Bee Nigma has helped some but they are not gone by a long shot. Overall it has helped my skin to remain smooth and supple but hasn't erased wrinkles. I do love the feel and the tingle makes me feel hopeful for longer term change.I'm giving this face cream five stars because I respect a company that is willing to stand behind their product 100% and allow the customer to try it out."
5092,1,Good product_I usually like all the Tresemme products but this one tops the list as it really controls hair fall and makes my hair smooth and shiny.
9503,1,"standard 2-in-1_This is your standard 2-in-1 kiddy shampoo / conditioner. We've been pleased with other &#34;flavors&#34; by Suave and this peach one was similar.  The scent is delicate, not overpowering.  It lathers well and rinses easily.  The detangling action worked pretty well on my daughters long hair. As with all &#34;2-in-1&#34; products they don't clean AS well as regular shampoo and they don't condition / detangle AS well as regular conditioner.  But they are convenient (especially for a kid who HATES getting rinsed) and they do the job."
7284,1,"Beige? You call that beige?_This isn't beige, it's platinum blonde and very pretty. It's thick and doesn't look fake, even with the pink. Fits well, good price, happy kid, so what more can you ask for?"
6105,1,The nose bridge clip is so effective_The nose bridge clip worked wonderfully for me. Day six I noticed a huge change. I wear the clip throughout the day and will continue to for the next two months. This beats rhinoplasty. I'm a major perfectionist and height critical and this the little clips are worth a shot
6920,1,"LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!_The Eveline products are good and they work pretty well I have been using this product for about a month. I have big improvements, I use it on my belly my arms and my thighs I had some cellulite on the back of my thighs because had gained so much weight from my baby. So I started to use this product I have seen the most improvements on my thighs and a bit on my belly. I do work out sometimes maybe three times a week, I'm very busy with work and school and my two kids I don't always have so much time to workout but I can say that alone it does a pretty decent job. I will definitely continue to use I had just recently ordered my second lotion. the warm sensation also makes you feel a bit hot that I do sweat a bit. I will recommend to anyone who wants to lose some inches off their waste."
8942,1,Very beautiful......_Very vibrant and beautiful piece...... Very attractive colors.......nice and heavy ..... Didn't expect this much for such low price ......
9354,1,"Great for your skin!_I have only been using this for a about 3 weeks, but have already noticed a difference in my skin. My skin is softer, clearer, and visibly looks better. I like that this product absorbs so well, is not oily, and dries quickly. You can apply your moisturizer right after applying this. I don't break out with this, either... (it doesn't clog your pores.) I'm excited so see even more benefits the longer I use it. I would recommend for sure!"
7026,0,MESSY_MESSY AND DID NOT LIKE THE COLOR MY STAIN GLOSS SOUNDED LIKE JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FORDON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE
8736,0,"Not a beauty blender._This product does not increase in size when wet. It also does not absorb and extra make up, it just smears it around.Source - Make up artist....."
740,1,"I love this dryer!_This dryer comes with its own nozzle that concentrates the flow into a single strip. This is perfect for getting my hair straight without using much product. The nozzle comes on and off easily, but it seems fairly sturdy for a light piece of plastic. I'm a big fan of this dryer, as it has reduced my morning routine by taking out the straightening step.I wish the nozzle were available on its own for purchase so I could use it when traveling."
4555,0,Not for me_I purchased this product because I thought it would help my dry natural hair.  However this product was not for me it made my scalp itch like crazy.  I passed it on to my daughter and it okay for her.
9183,1,"DermaRESTORE is excellent!!_I have tried a few different products to lighten/repair my stretch marks.  I am loving the result I am seeing with DermaRESTORE.  In the couple weeks I have been using it, my stretch marks are significantly lighter.  I enjoy knowing that the ingredients in this concentrated formula have been clinically researched.  Thanks so much for a great product!!!"
4640,1,"Great Polish_A gorgeous grape color with a slight holographic finish. :) Very pretty, and you can achieve full opacity in one thick coat, or two thin coats.This polish has an amazing fast drying formula."
2730,1,Adorable_This nail dryer is so adorable. It is easy to put in your nail travel kit and only requires 2 AAA batteries. You can dry up to two nails at a time and you activate it by pressing the banana button. I use it to dry designs as I decorate each nail. So worth the money!
130,1,"Love it._I loved it! I use it daily, and will definitely be buying again when this runs out. Thank you very much."
5108,1,"LOVE!_I had been eyeing this Tonymoly product for quite a while and I'm really glad I decided to buy it!When I got this in the mail it was really awkward taking it out because they wrapped it in 2-3 layers of bubble wrap, so I actually had to open the package IN the mailbox before I could actually take it out. Yeah...The packaging of this is really cute! I didn't get it in a box or anything, but the apple shape is good enough for me! When you open it there's a plastic cover with a small spatula on top, and when you take off the plastic lid the product is inside. The color is a milky yellow color and looks like a gel. Has a strong smell of apples.This product gets very messy when you try to apply it. The consistency is very smooth, but it is kind of liquidy, but can still stick to itself. It takes very little to cover your entire face, I use a dime sized amount and pat that around my face. It feels a little sticky, almost tacky like, but it absorbs into your face in a few minutes.I have cleaned and taken off the lid (I don't even use it to cover it). I also do not use the little spatula it comes with. I find it easier to use like that.Typically I'll use this right after I shower or in the morning. My face looks brighter, and after it sits for a while my pores look non-existent (I'm not sure if it's meant to do this because I have not seen this in any product descriptions)! It is very moisturizing, but it doesn't make my skin any more oily than it already is.Overall a very nice product! I'm giving it 4 stars because I didn't find the smell very appealing at first, but I'm used to it now. I recommend this!"
5835,1,"Great value_Great product, quick service.  Wish it had better instructions. . . .but maybe it doesn't need it.  I have experience with these products, but had I not, better instructions/care guide would've been nice."
6065,1,"*Seems* To Work, But I Still Break-Out!_The CLEARASIL ULTRA OVERNIGHT SCRUB didn't keep me from breaking-out but it did seem to make the pimples go away quicker than normal.Usually I'll breakout with one or two small to medium sized pimples that would take about a week to clear up, sometimes leaving a mark behind. After using the SCRUB for about 2 months, I noticed that the pimples didn't last as long and that probably has to do with the salicylic acid that causes the skin to breakdown and repair itself faster, basically shedding dead skin cells faster, so I'm sure that had a lot to do with it.I didn't use it everyday, which would be too drying for my skin type -- normal/oily combination -- and so I would use it every two to three days and only once a day. BTW, I also use an SPF moisturizer in the day time to combat dryness and to protect from UV rays because your skin tends to be hypersensitive to sunlight while using these types of products. If you have a sensitivity to salicylic acid this could be too drying for your skin.The SCRUB didn't lather too much and had larger granules than say Pro-Activ Face Wash, and it has that odd smell like medicinal perfume. Anyway, if you don't like the abrasive scrubs CLEARASIL also hasClearasil Ultra Acne + Marks Wash and Mask: 6.78 OZ, but I found that one to be really drying until my skin adjusted to it."
7561,1,"Great price, tons of bubbles!_The title says it all!  Lots of lavish bubbles, long lasting too!  I just wish that it had more of a lavender scent, but for the price I am not complaining.  I also appreciated the fact that the ingredient list was short, it didn't have a bunch of chemicals in it!"
9419,1,"Lovely Highlights_This product does add gloss and  really accentuated my highlights.I am fairly sure that the results depend on ones haircolor,the porosity of the hair and it's general condition.Squeezing a half dollar dollop (long hair), the gel is a deep chocolate brown. After applying and waiting three minutes, I checked in the mirror and was a bit alarmed to see my hair very, very dark. However, this blackish-brown was just temporary. During rinsing, it was strange that not much of this color appeared in the rinse water.Once dry, I noticed that it left nice ashy brown tones to my hair and the highlights were more emphasized. Quite a bit more luster too.My hair is medium and dark blonde and it worked very well with my processed and dry hair. I am pleased with the results.The only part of product use that I don't care for is that it tends to weigh down the hair and flatten it.I would recommend this product more to one who has processed hair as they will probably get the most visible results in shade as well as gloss."
9003,0,Itchy!_I took my shower and applied this sculpting powder and it started itching so I jumped back into the shower to get it out and start over. The smell was okay but this was a big flop with me. Plus you get this incredibly small amount(.035 ounces?-strange) for the price-it looks like a sample you would get at Macy's discount counter.Skip!
7789,1,"Nice product_I have a combination skin (with oily T zone) and rest areas very dry and this mask is for the dry areas of my face such as cheeks, chin, around the cheeks etc (while for T-zone, i use a clay mask).This is specially formulated for sensitive skin as i did not break out and it did quench the dryness of my face and made my skin shinny but in a healthy way.I use it as a once a week treat for my skin."
8909,1,works well_This bottle is small and came practically empty. That said it works pretty well with good pigment. The nars is more money but you get triple the product. I own both. They work similarly.
6012,1,"Doesn't feel greasy_Got this at the drug store so I could retune it if I didn't like it. Well, it is staying with me!I tried other CC creams from the department store, all more than double the price. They looked ok at first, then looked greasy within a few hours. Looked like wax on my face. I have dry skin, so there is no reason this should happen. The only thing I can think is that those had sunscreen and this does not.I use this over Olay moisturizer and under my pressed mineral powder. Leaves a bit of a glow, but not shine and feels good. It provides nice coverage, but doesn't make you look made up. I use a mineral sunscreen over my mineral powder, so I didn't really care about having sunscreen in this product. In fact, I prefer not having sunscreen and this is the only one I could find that didn't have it.I have been using Olay for years and, once again, it does not disappoint!Will be going on Amazon when I need more."
3972,1,Approved._Great for stippling foundation. It does provide heavy coverage. And now that my skincare routine has made my face acne-free. I don't really need as heavy coverage as with this brush. I now prefer the stippling brush from real Techniques core collection.
180,1,"Stays on Forever: Revlon at Amazon_This lipstick really stays on for a full day and probably longer if you don't take it off at night before sleeping. It also stays on coffee cups, spoons, etc. through a dishwasher cycle so check carefully when unloading the dishes to be put away or your house will look like a bad restaurant. I use Neutrogena eye make-up remover to remove it at night and I have read that some people use baby oil. If you want to go all day without worrying about your lipstick, this is the product for you. Sometimes I wonder what exactly is in it to make it stay on so long, but it's probably better for my peace of mind not to know."
4749,1,Best eye brow pencil...._Best eye brow pencil....Avon GLIMMERSTICKS Eye Brow Blonde.....great color and I have used these for years moist not dry and I love these.
5262,1,Great investment for your brushes_You really do need this if you want to extend the life of your brushes and keep them from getting splayed.
270,1,"nice coverage with two coats, and fairly long-lasting_This review is for the &#34;Danke - Shiny Red&#34; color (since products seem to be mixed on this review page) although a lot of what I have to say will apply to the entire product line.I can usually get away with using cheap nail polish on my toes.  I they don't come into contact with other surfaces that can cause chips.  But I was having a hard time finding a nail polish that lasted on my fingers -- I'm pretty hard on my hands -- so I decided to try something a little higher-end.This polish does a pretty good job on both fingers and toes, as it turns out.  It's still looking good on my toes after three weeks (with Essie combination topcoat and base coat).  It lasted for a couple of days on my fingernails, as well (with Seche Vite quick-dry top coat).  It probably would have lasted longer but I have to use my hands a lot -- I type all day at work and then I have to come home and do all sorts of household chores that chip away at fingernail polish.This goes on very easily and is highly pigmented.  Two coats were all it took to get nice, full coverage.  I found that it dried quickly and that the color was a lovely, shiny red -- just as advertised.  I hope to get many uses out of this bottle, and I now am a fan of OPI polishes in general.  Definitely worth the extra money."
9749,1,"Love it._I'm not so much into blues and greens for my nails, but i will make an exception with this one.  Just too cute.  Color is just beautiful; love it for spring; nice color for a tanned-latin girl; not all colors works for my color skin but this one does it."
5609,1,Metallic Crackle Review_I purchased the metallic crackles in silver and gold. I love the look! For some reason I had better luck with the silver crackle than the gold. The gold went on clumpy and didn't crackle as much. I might just need to make sure there's less on the brush next time.
7635,1,"All I can say is awesome colors, variety to choose from and mine was ..._All I can say is awesome colors, variety to choose from and mine was packed pretty well. The tubs are tiny, though and careful when opening. I made a mess the first time, but that's on me."
9872,0,Do not like the glove_The Revlon Curl Styling Brush heats up fast and it gets hot.  There is a reason you need the black glove that accompanies this tool.  It is almost impossible to use this brush without it and that is the drawback to this curling brush.  The bristles do not catch hair tightly so you will need the glove to hold the hair in place while you roll it.  The brush gets too hot without using the glove.  I found the glove irritating.  It is a bit scratchy and you really cannot run your fingers through a curled section with it.  I found myself constantly removing the glove to shape a part of my hair then putting it back on to curl another section.  If the bristles were a bit longer this would be a better brush. It curls well but I did not like using the glove.
3620,1,Better than my non-disposables_These are great. Fit over my hair clip well. I use them for taking showers and for putting over deep conditioning treatment.
9266,1,Conditions Well_Very strong vanilla smell. The bottle is pretty but not very functional. I have a medium amount of fine hair. I applied this to washed and towel dried hair (I did not condition). I used a very small amount. My hair was very shiny and static free. Love this stuff.
5051,1,"Moisturizing lip color_Compared to other drugstore brands, this is definitely not drying.It's really creamy and moisturizing, but it doesn't stay on as long as I'd like. (Maybe I need to exfoliate my lips. The application wasn't as great as I'd expected.) The CG flipstick lasted longer and had better pigmentation. I guess it depends on the shade. The scent is a tad to fragrant and borders on unpleasant at times, if you're used to unscented or mildly scented cosmetics."
732,1,"FUN WITHOUT THE SUN_Sun goes on easy and dries fast, for a quick tan before going out for the day or a quick tan before going out for the evening."
9290,1,"Comfortable, Effective Treatment for Dry Skin on Feet_Here in Texas we're suffering a drought, and drought makes a dry skin condition even worse.  I've tried the old home remedy - vaseline and cotton socks -- with less than stellar results, so I was anxious to give these get socks a try.So how do they do?  Great.  Moisturize feet after your bath or shower, and slip into a pair of these gel socks.  They are quite comfortable to wear and the results are the best I've ever had.  I highly recommend these for the dry skin of feet.FIVE STARS!"
9057,1,"nice and sturdy_its beautiful and of good quality i really love this product its reat for chic buns, a great piece for the collection"
1144,1,"Rule of Thumb: Apply after a hot shower_I've noticed that with this product, the strips tend to take a while to harden compared to other brands, which is a really good thing in my opinion. The other brands' strips would act like those Screen Protectors for your phones, where you would get air vacuum on some spots. But, not with this one."
314,1,Love this!!_This stuff smells so good and I am pretty sure it is because of this that my acne has gotten better! Will not go without this. Just ordered my second bottle.
4173,1,"Fun colors_I'm usually a neutral color kinda girl, but I love adding a little sparkle and 'umph' to my night out look. With all these metallic shades its super easy to get a great night out look :)"
9047,1,A lovely gift ~ anxious to try it_I cannot rate this product yet because I just received it yesterday.  This went to my old address and the P.O. finally got it to me at new address.  I will be happy to review this gift from you in a week or two.  Thank you for sending to me.
5781,0,"Come on Olay, why the harmful ingredients??_Isn't there some way to formulate this without methylparaben and other harmful ingredients? Why do we need to increase our risk of breast cancer and put something on our face that prematurely ages skin (methylparaben) just to fight acne? Not worth it. Olay - clean up your act!"
1820,1,"Among My Favorites!  Love This One!_I absolutely love this gloss in the color Iced Coffee!  I'm generally not one for gloss; however, this one gives a lovely shiny medium-neutral sheen to any color lip color I'm wearing.I just dab it on the center of my upper and lower lips (don't smear the lips together) and pretty much every time I wear it, someone will compliment me on my lip color!  I wear this over pinks, neutrals, lilacs and browns.  As long as you just dab it here and there, it truly adds a beautiful sheen.  It's not sticky, has a light pleasant scent and goes in my purse wherever I go.  I was in Ulta yesterday, trying this gloss, and that gloss, and I still say this is my favorite, hands down!Another must for this gal!"
1350,1,"Great for combination skin_I've used L'Oreal products in the past and have since tried other brands ofmoisturizers. This feels great on my skin when applied, and doesn'tfeel oily. Especially good on the neck area, and gentle enough to be usednear my eyes.  Found the price VERY reasonable on Amazon as well, compared toothers that I found less effective."
4139,1,Amazing_Ok i was a skeptic but after trying this product im hooked. I usually have problems getting a good cover from bare minerals but this product actually makes a difference under the eyes. Looks very professionally done makeup. Definitely buying more of this.
5793,1,This is a miracle for me!!_I ha a ba razor rash on my neck I picked at and it ended up marking my neck in 5 spots xp I used this as directed last night an I seen a major improvement! The marks were smaller and 40% lighter. So earlier today I figured why not try rubbing some in an leave some excess on covered with a bandaid all day. I took of the bandage and the marks were almost gone! Never in my life has anything worked this well for me! I highly recommend this. Idk if it matters but I'm a guy 21 yrs old with fair skin
543,0,"no frizz management and make the hair drier_Strong , not so nice, scent,It made my hair very dry and brittle and made frizz worse.I believe it is not good for dry hairs or for frizz control."
7224,1,"Exceeding expectations._I expected much cheaper quality (considering the price) than what was delivered.  These tools are heavy and of high quality.  You'll be impressed, too."
5401,1,"Stunning glitter!_This is one of my favorite Sinful Colors shades! I'm even wearing it right now, to try and beat the winter blahs!This can work both as a layering polish and as a polish on its on. I personally like layering it over similarly colored polishes (it looks amazing over Wet N Wild Teal Of Fortune) as it can be a bit of a pain to get off on its own. Don't let that deter you though! It's a stunning jewel toned teal, filled with golden, green, blue, teal, and rainbow glitter. I love it!"
7156,1,"Great product!_I got this through Amazon Vine. It's a great product. It has a mousse-like texture, and doesn't make my skin break out although I'm prone to clogged pores.Although it comes out of the tube a light brownish color, it doesn't provide any coverage like a foundation would. It also isn't moisturizing. Its only function seems to be as an SPF, so as somebody who uses a moisturizer with SPF and foundation, it doesn't fit in my usual regimen. As an extra boost of SPF on days that I'll be getting lots of sun or not wearing makeup, like for exercising or playing at the beach, it's a great alternative to all-over sunscreens that I might not want to put on my face. Highly recommended!"
8211,1,"Love this eyeliner_I love this eyeliner, it goes on so easy and it looks great.  I purchased this to do the inside water line and corner of my eye, it matches skin tone well and works great.  I am very happy with the quality of this liner and will probably buy other colors from Rimmel."
2888,0,Didn't work for me._I was very disappointed. I had read reviews of people tha thad the same problem as me. Dark blue circles under eyes. I thought &#34;finally something that works!&#34;.Well just like all the other concealers this one did not work...
9903,1,For Smaller Hands_This brush is made well and it is a nice color pink.  The size of the brush is intended more for small hands or a youngster to use.  The brush is made with flexible bristles that are kind of like little fingers combing through your hair. It works well to detangle hair so I would say it worked as I expected it to. It is better than trying to comb out tangles with a comb or brush them out with a regular hairbrush that just isn&#8217;t as easy to do.  I am providing this review as part of a market research program.
4712,1,"Far better than a wet towel!!!_The heat is a gentle heat but very effective.  The cap fits comfortable. You can comfortably wear glasses and read with the cap on. I love that it just says warm and no heavy wet towel that keeps getting cold.  I have had mine for years and I use it a couple times a month.  If I have done something to destroy my hair then a few times a week.  I couldn't live without this heat cap! It helps give outstanding conditioning to your hair.  I also suggest coconut oil to condition your hair.Nature's Way Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 16 OunceIt is also THE best skin tightener and conditioner."
2457,0,"Bad conditioner for a lot of money_This conditioner offers zero to no conditioning. It always left my hair very dry and hard. It did not improve the quality of my hair. It did not help with shedding.There is not a single thing good about this conditioner, what is more---it is grossly overpriced."
4196,1,perfect shape and size_This brush is easy to hold and is perfect for use in the shower--not too soft and not too abrasive.
983,1,"Excellent price and effective_I normally use Origins charcoal mask, but I tried the Mint Julep after a friend recommended it.  Normally I judge a product by its price, and I did not have high expectations for this product.  Despite my doubt, the Mint Julep has won me over.  The texture is thick and creamy, and it applies well on the skin.  My face gets a tingling sensation from the mint.  After wash, my pores are reduced and skin feels firm and refreshed.  I'm surprised that a $3 mask works as well at clearing my pores than a mask 10x its price.  You also get a larger amount with Queen Helene's.  Now I'm curious to try its other products."
4838,1,Beautiful Colour_Wonderful jewell tone.  It is a nice deep colour and is second only to Ocean Wave as my favourite Gelish colour.
5322,1,Very nice product_I am happy with the quality of this product.  I am anxious to see the results it will render.  I will buy again.
1630,0,Gold N Hot Conditioning Heat Cap_I purchased this heating cap sometime ago.  I must say what a disappointment.  It does not get hot at all.  It starts out at a decent temperature and than it does not get any hotter.  Please don't waste you money on this heating cap you will be very disappointed.  It also has an empty spot in the back where it does not get hot at all.
4842,1,"Perfect for a French manicure_I bought Sleek White to use with my gel light (see my other reviews for a how-to) and it worked like a charm. It went on smooth and I only needed 1 coat of white. I did this (see photos) freehand and it worked great. I did put it on too think on a couple of nails so it rippled after it cured under the light. But, after using the Gelish topcoat,Harmony Gelish Top-it-off 'Top Coat Gel .5oz' Ship Nowthe rippled smoothed out. I recommend it!"
1386,1,LOVE_This color was amazing. When I finally got it and opened it up it actually almost looks black. So I was thinking I got the wrong thing. When I applied the polish it was so pretty. I love colors that are so dark they almost look black. It went on so smoothly and it looks great with silver glitter. I recommend this product and the seller. Very pleased.
4086,1,"3 Reviews in One!_OK, I'm a guy.  I don't have much hair, and I pretty much use whatever--generally something cheap.  I considered this Fekkai kit overpriced frou-frou and, so, gave it to my picky wife.My wife commented on the great smell and ease of rinsing.  However, she complained that she got bad dandruff after only 2 days.  She said that even with cheap Suave shampoo, she could go 4 days.  She went back to her other regimen of products.  Rating: 3 stars.Next up, my daughter, also thought the smell was great and rinsed cleanly.  Good, but not great.  Expensive.  Rating: 4 stars.I figured I may as well try it, not expecting much more than a great smell.  It does have a pleasant citrus/herbaceous smell.  But what is glossing?  The best I could figure was that it is 'infused' with olive oil.  Whatever.I found out the products are REALLY concentrated and considering the little amount of hair, I only needed a small dab (maybe a very large pea size) of the shampoo and conditioner.  It also takes a 'hair' more effort to work in as a result its concentration.  Now, I can't believe I'm writing this, but my hair really does feel thicker and fuller.  I can't say that of any past products I can recall.  My fine/thin (and thinning), dry hair seems to really like this stuff.  Didn't expect that at all.  My rating: 5 stars.Family overall rating: 4 stars.Also, Amazon's information is a little misleading.  For the Glossing Conditioner, you apply [...] and then rinse thoroughly."
9524,1,Great smelling shampoo_This shampoo has a nice scent to it and my hair feels clean and has body after I use it. Most of the products in the Suave Professionals line are worth buying.
8344,1,"Subtle scent, smooth shave, clean feeling_The Dove Men+Care Hydrate + Shave Gel gives you a great foundation before and after you shave. Once you apply the gel, it provides a smooth glide path on your face so you can run a razor without cutting your face. It hydrates your face giving it a smooth, clean feeling right after shaving. The post shaving skin irritation is highly minimized. It smells great too, giving a tame, manly scent that is very desirable. My wife has complimented on how good it smelled right after I shaved. The Dove Men+Care shaving balm is a great compliment for this shaving gel. Makes shaving chore somewhat of a pleasure. Great, great product from Dove."
403,1,"squeeky clean_what can i say, it cleans my gray and black hair very well and it also cleans my hair well."
5972,1,"Dries Fast!_If you are searching for a blow dryer that dries your hair fast, this product is a great choice. It has over 1800 watts of drying power, and the two fans work very efficiently to get hair dried quickly. Once the hair is dry, I prefer to use a lower setting when styling, to keep maximum control over that process. This is a great blow dryer to use during the winter, when going out with wet or even damp hair is especially undesirable!"
5473,1,Better than I though_My daughter told me our hairdresser recommended this to her and I tried it and can't believe the difference.  Would gladly recommend to anyone.
8919,1,"Good product_A little goes along way with this product so start off using a small amount and build the coverage up to your liking, dont build too much though because like all concealers it will end up cakey. the texture is smooth and creamy, really blendable, blends in well with my skin tone. overall I liked it and will consider repurchasing"
8664,1,"Perfect for Stretching Your Relaxer?!_I bought this product for a friend whose damaged hair was on the right path to recovery.Just to give you some insight, her hair was porous with split ends and had a very rough, dry texture due to poor maintenance.Within four months, her hair was completely revitalized after weekly hot oil treatments, protective hairstyles like braiding, bi-weekly protein treatments and weekly deep conditioning sessions.She ended up straightening her hair with a relaxer. After a month she wanted to maintain her look and I bought this product for her.This product did an excellent job at maintaining her hair's sleek appearance despite two weeks worth of curly new growth.I researched keratin online and discovered its other benefits like:- Stops frizz- Repairs hair such as damaged or chemically treated hair (colored, permed, relaxed, highlighted or bleached)- Adds shine, softness and smoothness- Moisturizes and resolves hair damage- Dramatically decreases drying and styling time- Seals color"
8348,1,"Dove products always deliver_I like mens shaving gel.  There, I said it.  Oddly, I have met a couple men that prefer women's shave gels.  Whatever floats your boat.This shave gel has a gentle scent, and does a great job foaming and providing a good close shave.Happy, per usual, with Dove products!"
5323,1,"Quite Surprised_For starters, I live on a beach and it doesn't get that cold here. Snows every other year or so in April (thanks to global warming) and school closes automatically if it gets colder than 40 or so degrees, snow or not (just to shows how ridiculously they treat cold weather here). I ventured out for a winter lotion for this harsh cold weather, or &#34;arctic blast&#34; as they're calling it.This is my first Vaseline lotion. I really like the scent of Cocoa Butter Vaseline, so imagine my surprise when I discover Vaseline has a whole line of lotions, including their cocoa butter scent. It is a light scent that isn't harsh, artificial, or overwhelming at all. The scent alone is what prompted me to try this lotion first, and I'm glad I did. The lotion itself is creamy but not thick, and spreads very easily. I use it immediately after the shower and to touch up my hands after being in the cold. It goes on smoothly, sinks in quickly, and doesn't grease up at all if you use one pump per each arm, each leg, torso, back, feet. It greases up on my hands if I use too much, and have to wait a few minutes for it to soak in completely if using too much on hands. Half a pump is enough for my hands.Hours later after going outside briefly and my whole body is soft and velvety and smooth! I'm very surprised to find my torso soft and my feet still moisturized well. I like the lotion more than the petroleum because it soaks in better and isn't in a jar which easily contaminates from fingers. I am now a believer of Vaseline CocoaRadiant Lotion and will continue to buy this item for as long as I can. I love that they give you various sizing options of the lotion, from 3 to 32 ounces. I purchased a large pump of 32 ounces from Target at 6.69"
1598,1,Good Product_I recently tried the NEW Aveeno Calming face wash and it was GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Did NOT dry my skin out. The 6oz. is a little pricey though I think it should be either 7 or 8 oz for the price.
9387,1,"A Great Product that Improves Tone and Texture_My wife tried this and made the following observations: It is lightweight, absorbs quickly and is not sticky.  The smell is very neutral and my skin feels clean after use.  The serum also dries quickly and I was able to follow with my moisturizer without delay.  I used one pump both morning and night and followed with my daytime moisturizer and nighttime moisturizer (both Origins).  My skin texture was smooth and soft after using the product.  I  have yet to see any visible change to the few dark spots I have on my skin.  Overall I like the Vitamin C Serum and believe it improved the elasticity of my skin.  Regarding the packaging, I would recommend that the bottle have a &#34;see-thru&#34; area so that you know how much product is remaining in the bottle.  The wrap around label prohibits me from knowing without removal of the same."
4379,1,Perfect_Perfect eyeliner .this eyeliner very clear on my eye .I am bought more and more of eyeliners pencil but is not clear
5701,1,"Purse prefect!_This product is prefect to put in your purse when you are on the go it has everything you need, very handy!"
2656,1,"Very happy_I've owned a few pairs of hair cutting scissors, and so far these are my favorite (and most expensive, although not by much). They are nice and sharp and give a clean cut. I also like the rubbery texture on the inside of the handles - makes it easier to keep them in place, I think."
7362,1,I'm an eyelash snob and I love these._These are great eyelashes. The adhesive that's designed to keep them on the plastic is actually enough to keep them on for their first wear believe it or not. These find the right balance between being full but not being fake. (Although I swear by iENVY Professional [by Kiss] strip eyelash adhesive in jet black.) These aren't the cheap lashes you sometimes get that fall apart after one use. They seem like they will hold up for a few wearings. They really make your eyes pop. I didn't need to trim them. They have a nice curve to them. The strip isn't so thick that it looks fake but it's thick enough to hold adhesive. These are my new go-to lashes.
3708,1,Good gentle exfoliation_I've been using this for a little while now and am very happy with the results. I only use a small amount (a little goes a long way) and this leaves my skin so much softer and smoother than the expensive brands I've tried.
6967,1,"Kind of loving this stuff!_Im in my mid 30's and going through this weird adult acne/ seriously dry skin phase all of a sudden. I have to be really careful about what type of cleansers I use because I don't want to irritate my skin and make it worse. After finding the right cleanser I realized that I needed a good exfoliant to get the dry flaky skin off. I started using this only in the mornings (while I shower) and I love it! The texture is of course gritty, but it doesn't have an offensive smell and most of all it's not tingly on the skin. Don't you just hate those tingly feeling cleansers? Ugh! It's like they're supposed to make your skin feel clean all for the purpose of convincing you that your skin if officially clean, haha! It has no actual benefit to it whatsoever. Ok back to this scrub! I use a dime sized amount and work it into circles all over my face. There is no residue or icky after effects. It gets the dry skin off without irritating my skin and that for me is huge!! So far I'm hooked and will repurchase this scrub once I'm out."
9837,1,loved it_This company is great they really follow up with you and send you all the information you need. I used it last night on my husband's scalp just one  drop and I massaged it making him feel relaxed and his scalp was smooth. It does not smell like flowers (Rose) to me it smells a little like green tea. I used it on my face this morning just one drop with my wet freshly clean face and it was a great a experience. Will come back in month to give you my experience since this is just my first impression.
1905,0,"NOT FOR PEOPLE W SCENT ALLERGIES: Causes burning sensation, redness, breakouts, self-doubt_I have fairly but not extremely sensitive skin and have used C serums before with no negative results.It may be the powerful orange scent added to this but this Vitamin C Vitality Serum caused my face to become violently hotly red and itchy when I applied it to either my face or neck.Being the absolute moron that I am, I continued to use it several more times thinking that just might be how it worked and that I needed to tough it out like some kind of boot-camp for my face. MAN-UP WOMAN FACE!I realized though, when I started breaking out in whiteheads on my forehead and chin like the teenager I haven't been for over 20 years that I needed to toss this product in the trash and move on.If you have semi-sensitive skin or reactions to strong scents, take a pass on this product."
8683,1,"Conditions Fine Hair Well, But A Bit Thick_I have fine hair which is frizzy if not conditioned. Tresemme Keratin Smooth does a nice job of smoothing my hair- as well as Moroccan oil. It is a bit thick (I'd prefer a spray), but the smell is pleasant enough. One minor benefit: I found this much easier to wash off of my hands than Moroccan oils."
5513,0,Not universal_This shouldn't be called a universal brow pencil because its too dark for my already dark brows.  I tried pressing really lightly and still end up with unnatural looking brows.
3413,1,Great lotion that actually moisturizes without being too oily_There's not really all that much that can be said about lotion. Either it does what you want or it doesn't. This lotion moisturizes and has a nice liquidy texture but without being too oily. It works as a face lotion even though it's not specifically designed to be a face lotion. For anyone with dry skin this lotion does the trick and lasts a long time after being applied.
3517,1,"Great color match but not for oily skin_I've been using both the Hot Pink and Gold Skin 79 BB creams and the main problem I have with both of them is that although the coverage is excellent, it tends to make my face look too white.  My face ends up looking another color than my neck.  I read the reviews for this one so I decided for under $20 why not give it a try.First the positives:I have very light Asian skin.  I typically use Fairly Light tones for foundation and this product worked well for me with regards to color matching.  My face no longer looks grayish.  It is very natural, comparable to putting on tinted moisturizer but with slightly better coverage. It also works well for sensitive skin.  The Hot Pink and Gold made me break out after a week and this one is easier to wash off since it is less thick than the other two.With regards to the cheek/lip tint, I love the light pink color.  A few dabs on my lips and cheeks give me a natural rosey glow.Negatives:This is not a full coverage BB cream.  I also noticed after 4 hours, my skin was oily.  I have combination skin to begin with but I think that this does not work well for oil control.  The lip and cheek tint will also NOT work for someone with darker skin tone.  The color is extremely subtle.  It is a tint and not a blush so don't expect it to give you maximum color.  I don't really like the texture of the lip/cheek tint, it is like a non-sticky chapstick bar but oilier.  Also this BB cream is not matte.  It is a bit shiny but not too shiny like Etude House creams.Overall, if you want a light, everyday BB cream for sensitive/dry-normal skin, this product will work well for you."
3852,1,Nyx blush in Taupe_I ordered this as a contour. I have very pale skin. This works great as long as you use it properly. A little goes a long way and you can build it up if needed.
595,1,Good hair color_Love the color and it is healthy to use.  I feel the price is also good.  Will order more in the future.
8057,0,"OK, but not really necessary.._These are ok, but are not really necessary... and therefore, not worth the money.  It works just as well to use an old cotton tee shirt."
1528,1,"Whoa!_First off, Skin Laboratory is a wonderful company to work with....very quick shipment, packaged well, love the detailed instructions that come along. The results.....Whoa!  My nose has been bothering me a great deal....those darn blackheads.....my pores have been enlarging.......I've tried other products to fight these symptoms, Dr. Perricone and Dr. Denese....both have good products but This Peel is solving the problem and fast too.  Loving it!  I have dry skin so I ordered and just received Skin Lab's lactic acid which is recommended for dryer skin.  But glad I started with this formula for a boost and the lactic will hopefully maintain.  Go for it ladies.  FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!  This is potent stuff if you haven't used anything like it before.  Go slow.  I had a peel done in my dr's office a few years back and knew what to expect.....by the way, that simple peel was $125.00."
5214,1,"A little goes a long way_Don't waste any by thinking you need a ton to make your hands feel better.  This has sort of an ointment like feel to it when you first put it on, but then it absorbs quickly and makes your skin feel so much better than the dry flaky-ness it had before.  Using it more often it is even more effective.  I have already purchased this item multiple times, and will continue to do so.  I have one by the bed, in the car and in my purse."
2772,1,"Worth buying._Really really like this product. Enzymes good for the skin, very fragrant with pineapple. Non-drying, good quality and good price."
8724,1,WHAT A GREAT DIFFERENCE._This past year I decided to pay more attention to my hair and this product truly does make a difference. My hair is usually very dry and tough especially after taking a shower so I decided to try this product since L'Oreal makes terrific products. The first day I tried it I noticed that my hair became so silky and smooth after drying. I LOVE IT. Plus it's cheap for one so it's very cost efficient! (especially if you're a poor college student like me.) This'll probably last you a month or so. If you're doubtful DON'T BE. you won't regret it!!
2459,1,"This is a life changing product._I have sensitive acne prone skin. It is gentle but effective. I use it twice a week and it has greatly reduced my breakouts, improved my skin texture, and has lightened any skin discolorations. Now it will always be a part of my beauty regiment."
5034,1,"Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System Review_It has been four months now since I purchased the Olay Pro-X. I absolutely love this product. I am 22 years old and don't have very problem skin, however I feel it is difficult to do a good job taking my makeup off at night. I have tried wipes, wash cloths, my hands, you came it. Nothing compares to the cleaning power of the Olay Pro-X.  It came in a set, with a small trial size bottle of the cleaner as well which was nice, because the full bottle is a bit pricey so I wanted to try it first. The brush has two speeds which is nice because at first you will want to use the low speed until your skin gets used to the brush then in time you can go to the other speed if you wish. Even on the first day I could feel the deep clean happening. I ONLY use the brush twice a week to prevent any harsh side effects on my skin, but I love it. I look forward to the nights when I use my Olay Pro-X. I would for sure recommend this product to anyone who is interested. Well worth the money and you can usually find one on sale- either on Amazon or at Target."
7604,1,Lasts!_I started using this as my lipstick & cheek blush when recommended by Shop Smart magazine.  They are right.  It lasts and looks great.
2626,1,Believe the hype!_I found this product through MUA and have been blown away. I put the gloss on at 6:30 PM the same day I got it- and couldn't believe my eyes when I woke up the next morning- it was still on! I have fair skin and the color looks a bit darker on my lips than pictured (even with one coat.) I'm wearing a red/wine colored dress today and it matches perfectly. I love the gloss so much that I bought 3 more colors. This stuff is brilliant! I hope they continue to put out more colors....would love a lip color close to the color of baby lips.You will fall in love with this!
3302,1,"3 year warranty, nice features and great build quality, but it's not magic_Powerful and priced right, I purchased this hair dryer to replace an aging Conair 1800 watt dryer.  I was impressed with the numerous positive reviews for this product, so I thought I'd give it a try.My first impression, as was the case for many reviewers, is how much heavier this dryer is than others I've used.  Its 9' power cord is substantial and the Professional Super Turbo 2800 (as it is named on the box...) is hefty , but not oversized.  The grip is comfortable, so the added weight doesn't seem that noticeable to me.The selling points to this dryer are the following:+ 2000 watts+ 'Ionic' - negative ions eliminate static, and reduce drying time.+ 'Ceramic' - emits the negative ions and generates far-infrared heat, which is less harmful to your hair.+ (6) heat/speed setting combinations; cool to hot, all work well.+ Extended life AC motor with limited 3-Year Warranty from time of purchase (with receipt) or time it was manufactured without a receipt, per the included instruction/styling guide.+ Cold shot button.+ Removable, easy to clean rear filter; twist and remove.+ Concentrator nozzle - removable.Unlike many of the reviewers, I noted no 5-10 minute improvement in terms of shortened drying time of my thick, wavy, medium length hair.  I also noted no great change in the texture of my hair after using this product.I use the following styling products which tend to keep my hair soft, smooth and frizz free other than in the harshest humid conditions:Suave Professionals 4 Piece Keratin Gift SetandSuave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Moroccan Argan Styling Oil, 3 Ounce.  I deep condition as needed and color usingL'Oreal Paris Excellence Creme Hair Color, 4G Dark Golden Brown.I also use this flat iron:HSI PROFESSIONAL 1 CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER FREE GLOVE + POUCH AND travel size Argan Oil Leave In Hair Treatment. WORLDWIDE DUAL VOLTAGE 110v-220v.I paid about forty for it, which is on par with lesser dryers at my local store with shorter warranties.  The increased air pressure is salon-like, and the build quality seems on par with its warranty.  It's a very good product if you can get it at the right price, but it isn't a miracle worker.  If your hair is damaged and/or you need a haircut to get rid of split ends, this hair dryer won't fix 'fuzzy' results.  As long as you know this prior to buying it, you should be happy with your purchase."
3543,1,"Good stuff_Good stuff, though expensive. The directions say to rinse it off in 15 minutes or so. But, I don't see why. It melts into your heels, so no reason to rinse it off. To each his own, though. There's no scent, so that's great. It's pricey, so I use it once a week and other regular lotions in between."
3063,1,"A decent stamping kit_This kit worked reasonably well. I used the two tiny flower images and the stars and they turned out pretty. They do run a bit on the smaller side but this was my first stamping kit and with no prior experience, I would say it was an easy to use kit and the results were good."
2434,1,My dermatologist recommended this. My husband and I both use his ..._My dermatologist recommended this.  My husband and I both use his and we love it.  It's the best sunscreen we've ever used.
7513,1,Beautiful!_Pretty perfect and colorful bows! I love these so much they are exactly what you see in their picture! Awesome!
7841,0,One Star_cheap quality. You get what you pay.
7985,1,"Customize your facial to hydrate the skin_Recently I have enrolled in the esthetics program.  I always took care of my skin and body and do not find esthetics services to be just pampering.  Taking care of body and skin means reducing daily stress by relaxation and maintaning one's physiological and psychological well being. It certainly helps when treatments are performed by using high quality products.Hyaluronic acid is common ingredient in most high quality skin care.  I ordered product to use it when I make customized serum for my at home skin care regimen.  I typically mix in a jar skin softening gel, 2 pumps of hyaluronic acid and 2 pumps of pure vitamic C.  This product is very convenient because of the pump.  I do not have to guess how much product to use.  I just count pumps.  My skin is calm, smooth and soft after the treatment.  Nice size of the jar will insure it lasts for a long time.  I will be definitely back buying more of this product.  I only wish the same company is also selling the equivalent of Bioelements' Softening Gel I can mix with hyaluronic acid."
3313,1,Best lip gloss ever!_It smells like cherry and the colour is really pretty. It's a peachy shade. I like the texture it isn't sticky at all. Definitely worth a try. They are super affordable and great quality.
9162,1,"Soothing and non-greasy relief for dry skin_I suffer from dry skin and my hand are always irritated. I love this lotion - even for non-eczema skin.  It is soothing, rubs in well and non-greasy.  There is no fragrance, so I can use it at work (I work in a hospital where fragrances are not allowed).  I look forward to having it on hand (literally!!) for this winter when dry skin is a part of Alaskan winters!"
3626,1,A Fav!_This is my second favorite mascara to wear (I like the volume one just slightly better). It makes my lashes look amazing and hardly ever flakes off or smears.
7228,1,"Moisturizing but not greasy. Perfect for reactive skin._I have been experimenting with moisturizers over the past year, and this one is the one that I come back to. It's a gel, light...cooling and not greasy at all. My sensitive, reactive, oily t-zone, dry cheeked skin soaks it up. The fragrance isn't overbearing and it leaves my skin prepped for foundation or BB cream. This is a total 5 star product and I won't be buying any other moisturizer. This one is heads above the rest for my skin type."
4061,1,Amazing gift!_This gift set has it all! everything you need is included. My cousin received this for her birthday and loves it! I cant believe that all of this comes for the price of 1 item from competitors.
3729,1,"Great for acne-prone skin!_I absolutely love this sunscreen. It has a high SPF, and it goes on light and rubs in very easily. I have oily skin that's prone to breakouts, and this sunscreen actually helped my acne. I didn't notice this until I ran out, but when I stopped using it I started getting acne around my jawline. It's completely scent-free, so if you're sensitive or allergic this would be ideal. I use it daily in the summer, and for outdoor winter activities like skiing. I will definitely buy this again!"
4362,1,"a masculine, sophisticated scent_This scent is very good without any strong peculiar scent that may turn some off.  I think this would make a solid addition to anyones collection.  FYI:  I like Chrome, Chrome Legend, Kenneth Cole reaction, Touch, Black, Lucky.  So if you like those, you will like this particular Curve.  Curve are all different so don't discount the whole lineup if you happen to dislike one."
5398,1,"Eyeshadow Galore_Got these for a christmas gift for my daughter , they are very pretty colors and were as expected. she uses many different makeups but this is one of her favorites"
6123,0,"What you do get is fine_I was another person who counted what they got.  But, I only did it because I got so few so that the counting was quick.Purple - 225Bright pink - 4 (yes, four, they filled the space primarily with purple)Green - 139Pink - 53Blue - 51Yellow - 65Light Blue - 55Black - 63Light Purple - 52Light Green - 67Red - 66White - 64Total - 904For the price I wouldn't generally complain about (or probably even notice) a few (or a couple hundred even) that were gone, but this is pretty bad.  They shorted me by over 60%.On the plus side, what I got is all very nice.  They are mostly very evenly shaped and have good color."
3777,0,"Oh man... HULK FACE!_This product is garbage. I tried to work with it, it was runny, messy, did not blend and did not solve the redness problem. No matter how much foundation I put on or how thin was the layer of this product, I would still be green! Also, I didn't feel like it grabbed to my foundation. I never disapproved a product as I disapprove this one.Waste of money. BIG waste of money. Again this product is garbage, and it belong to my trash bin."
4467,1,Great product for the Price_Awesome product. Lots of colors to play with and they are all very shiny. Ordering eyeshadow is risky (I've had several arrive in powder form from being smashed around) but these arrived in tact. These palettes last forever and give you so much variety to play with.
2729,1,"best face cream on the market_my mother used this when i was growing up.  she had to order it through her pharmacy.  i didn't start using it until several years ago in my thirties.  this is the most soothing, moisturizing face cream i have ever used and i've tried ALOT.  i am thankful to find it at Amazon as i was having to drive a ways to find it at CVS."
5663,1,Great product!_I like doing my own nails at home and this is a great product to use! The price was great as well!
4792,1,"heats quickly, interesting design_With highly variable heat settings, tapered wand, and a heat-resistant glove in lieu of the more traditional component to press your hair to the heated element, this is definitely different than many curling irons. There are some pros and cons with the device:Pros:*Heats Very quickly*Ceramic surface allows for even heat*Has precise heat controls (approx 10 degree intervals) instead of the usual 'hi/lo', etc.*Varied size curls can be made with tapered wand*Hair does not snag, as it can sometimes do with traditional designs with the holding clip component*Fast process (with mixed results)Cons:*Hair wants to slip upwards and off the wand (I have long hair--not sure if this makes it worse or better, but it has been challenging so far)*Tapered iron can be difficult to maneuver--do you want the curls to decrease in size as they go down, increase? It's almost impossible to have them to stay the same size throughout, since the taper is pretty drastic, and putting layers of hair over the iron will cause uneven heating (very hot for the first layer of hair, and almost none for the outermost layers, resulting in Very uneven curls)*Securing the last, thinnest strand of hair is challenging. If you don't find a way to secure it, your hair unwinds, but just grabbing it awkwardly  can sometimes make the ends of the curls look a little wonky*Figuring out the best way to hold both the iron and the gloved hand becomes pretty awkward, and at some points, you wish they included two gloves, and at other times, wish it didn't need gloves in the first place. Explanation: sometimes you need to make adjustments to the iron while holding your hair to the wand (which is the only way to secure it, since the clamp is not present), but to make those adjustments, you can likely get burned. Likewise, if you want to adjust your hair After you've curled it, if you don't take the glove off, it sort of sticks to your hair almost like velcro and ruins it, which means you have to take the glove off. I wasn't even sure which hand should use the glove. I am right-handed, but after switching a few times, still couldn't figure out which way was better. This resulted in putting on, taking off, and switching the glove from one hand to the other. It was an unnecessarily fussy process, and I'm really good with tools of other kinds (power tools, crafting, sewing, cooking--basically, there is no reason for me to be bad at this)In short, this product has some potential with the various features, and is probably pretty good for doing someone else's hair. For doing your own curls, however, I would not recommend it unless you are prepared to spend several hours of sometimes failed attempts to perfect a technique. I'll try again and see, since the ceramic surface is definitely preferable."
6208,1,"Good dotting tools, needs more sizes_These dotting tools work just like they say. Im happy with them the only thing I would change is about 3 of  the dots are really close in size so you cant tell the difference in the dot. But out of all the shopping around Ive done they all seem to have that problem. At least I get a variety of sizes to choose from."
429,1,"good_nice light smell and feel.  Using it to make various lotions, and body scrubs.  Works well with the scents I have used so far."
1183,1,Great peel_I love this product. I had gotten a sample of it and really enjoyed the sample. I use this about once a week to do a general peeling off of the old skin and it makes my face brighter and clearer. Just make sure you follow the direction exactly and it is a good product to use. Much better than those drug store mask that tends to dry our face out. This one I can actually see results and its easy to use and does what it states.
7808,1,purple brush set_For an inexpensive set these are of decent quality. The purple case is pretty but stinks to high heaven!  I have let it sit out to try and dissipate the chemical odour and its slowly getting better.  The brushes are soft and work pretty well; especially the powder and blush brushes. Not the best but definitely worth the money.  The brushes themselves are quite attractive with dark red wood handles and purple bristles.
5012,1,Love it_It smells divine! Very similar to Moroccan oil but a little bit heavier. I find the same dose of this product will leave my hair greasier looking than Moroccan oil. It's wonderful if my hair is feeling a little extra dry and it smells absolutely delicious! Their hair mask is amazing too!
9339,1,"Yummy collection!_I really like the NYX cosmetics that I've tried so far, and I've been hearing great things about their Butter Gloss. I decided to go for this collection of three different shades, and I am so glad that I did! They go on like a dream, feel very creamy and the colors are subtle but divine! If you are looking for ultra-color saturation, go for an actual lipstick. But, this product will give you a nice, fresh look with just the right pop of color to highlight the smoothness of your lips. Since it's a gloss, it's not tremendously long-lasting, but I find that to be expected so certainly not a problem.Highly recommended for a little cosmetics-fun!"
989,1,"works great!_I recently switched to sulfate free shampoo and conditioner, and this is the second I have tried.  It is my &#34;keeper&#34; for sure.  The smell is flowery, but doesn't seem to bother my allergic nose.  I find that using this shampoo and conditioner together eliminates the frizz I used to deal with (so I no longer have to use other anti frizz products etc.)  Highly recommend!"
6399,1,"Sigma Products are the best_I love Sigma brushes they are real good quality brushes.  I'm almost complete with the full set of these brushes, they have the best brushes for the best price - to me better than MACI love Sigma brushes they are real good quality brushes."
4210,0,Dont buy this_These sucked. Not the right sheer color. I like the white though. Nd the nail guides it came with. Wasted my $5 -_-
5131,1,"never byy anythig ekse_Love this stuff, i buy it religiously! Goes on great, I dont get streaks or look orange, but nothing lasts like a real tan of course, but this is close enough. Doesnt come off blotchy like spray tans!"
7714,0,It smells like Raid bug spray!_This crap smells terrible! One sniff gave me a headache. I walked past my dresser where the vial was sitting and got a headache again. I threw it away! Gross.
9193,1,"Good buy_I always enjoy products like these, and these will work just fine for my nail art. I was a bit sad to notice that I got two wheels exactly the same, which is a bummer. But still like the hearts."
788,0,Not for me_Made my hair feel worse leaving it in.  Even with using the slightest amount. I didn't care for the smell either.
5273,1,"The perfect family sunscreen_This is a sunblock, it leaves a layer of minerals on the skin that bounces the light off the skin. The product does not absorb into the skin. It goes on thick and visible, which I really like as it helps me know if I have missed a spot. After about ten minutes it melts to clear. I tend to react to chemicals in sunscreens, so I would never chance using a chemical sunscreen on my kids. This sunblock really works well, is easy to use, and doesn't irritate. I like that is doesn't wash off right away in the water. It comes off easily with soap though. My kids didn't get so much as a tan after a couple days outside. I use it for myself as well, it works for the whole family. A new staple in my house. I will be ordering 2 more to get me through the summer."
3257,1,love it_I love this eye pencil. It applys evenly on you eye line and lasts about half of the day. I love it
5916,1,"Shiny & Sparkly..._WOW!!!  My daughter has used this dryer several times on her long, slightly wavy, medium to thick, blonde, highlighted hair which can get slightly frizzy under certain conditions. Her hair has turned out shiny & sparkly each time with no  static electricity or frizz.  She's been using the low/warm setting. I have shiny, baby fine, straight  hair...it's difficult for me to get volume using any  dryer.  This dryer is no  exception.This hair dryer has more settings than any we've used in the past. It isn't overly heavy, but I wouldn't call it lightweight.  It comes with two different styles of concentrators & a diffuser.  Even when using the warm setting, her hair  dries quicker with this hair dryer and has more volume than it's had lately. One dryer she was using was made so that her hair would get stuck in it which would pull the hair strands; this one doesn't do that.I was going to list the attributes of this drier but noticed that they're listed in the Manufacturer's Product Description so take a look.For my family, the claims for shinier hair with more volume are true.5 Starsedited to add: I forgot to mention that the buttons are easy to use/find, but they do get in the way a little when you're using the dryer.  Also be sure to keep the filter clean. Any dryer will overheat & the motor could burn out if the filter isn't kept clean. The filter is on the back. This drier actually has two screened filters which provide even more protection than any other dryer we've used."
2598,1,Good value!_My friend is obsessed with this scent- he's known and loved it for years. The price on Amazon was so low I just couldn't pass it up. The packaging was great and it made a great add-on gift for Christmas.
299,1,Really works well!_The dermablend cover creme works really well for any type of coverup needed. It really works well for deep scars and blemishes. The creme stays on forever. I would suggest to anyone who has had burnt skin with scarring to use this product. This creme is also waterproof. You can go swimming or take a shower and the creme doesnt wash off. Great product for those who needs a reliable concealer.....
1720,0,"Design flaws in the tube/applicator make it impractical to use_I received this (through my husband's Prime account) a couple weeks ago and am a bit underwhelmed. The color is nice in the bottle but doesn't appear much browner or lighter than your everyday dark brown/espresso. Not a big worry, though...The main issue is the applicator. Even though it's a small item, the distance between the swirls in the brush is wide enough to synch your lashes together and make for pretty obnoxious clumps. I use an eyelash brush to separate my lashes, but when I do so after the mascara is dried in order to provide more individual-standing lashes, it flakes off literally half of the product I just applied, onto my cheeks. It's actually pretty rough - like getting tangles out of your hair. I tried cleaning and then using a brush from another mascara, but while it would fit down into the tube, it wouldn't close because of a different sized top.As other reviewers noted, there's also the issue of plunging - for lack of a better word! I can barely pull the applicator out without mascara building up outside the top lip of the tube. Putting it back in makes even more product ooze out and eventually there will be so much outside the tube that the applicator is going to seal it shut. So I clean it off every day, losing a lot of product - a sad waste.I'm a little surprised this has reviewed so well, and that's the reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 - maybe it's just me. I had high hopes because it seems like a stellar ingredient list, especially for the price. Alas, I won't be buying this again.*****************************Update one week later:I downgraded my rating from 2 stars to 1 - which reflects my real reaction anyway - because I realized part of the reason why people have given it good reviews: many of them are VINE reviewers. This means they get the product for free and try it for a day or two to test it out & rate it. The products are often not given enough time to see how they really work and to build up the issues I noted above."
4541,1,"Nice product_I have been using this product along with the matching shampoo for the last several weeks.  My hair is naturally curly, and does tend to frizz.  With all of the thunder and lightening storms we have had over the last few weeks, I have had an excellent chance to test out this conditioner vs the mother nature induced frizz.I personally tend to swap between Herbal Essences and Pantene about every other bottle, so I am no stranger to Pantene products.What I have noticed about this shampoo/ conditioner:1) The conditioner is THICK, so you really want to keep from adding too much to your hair... it can take a long time to rinse all of it out (Yes I made this mistake)2) The scent is nice, though nowhere near as potent or long lasting as the original Pantene products.3) My hair did stay more 'calm' although this could be because of the buildup that Pantene is known for.4) I didn't find that my hair was any smoother to the touch then when using the Herbal Essenses or other Pantene.  In fact it actually FELT a little rougher then after using the other Pantene products.In conclusion - I'm not sure that I would spend extra money on this line of products, but I certainly didn't find anything wrong with them.  I would have a hard time buying Pantene products and not having that smell that I so love.  Still if this is your hair type and you have frizz issues, you might at least want to give this a try.  It's no miracle but it can help a bit."
4796,1,"Great Product_This is a really great curling wand, at least for my hair type which is lightly curly and thin. After one burn now I manage how to use it and it is really easy. I totally recommend this item."
2606,1,Best conditioner ever!_all i have in terms of this conditioner is it really works on my hair type! I have naturally curly hair that i have relaxed a month ago and i'm currently trying to grow my hair but in a healthy way and this conditioner leaves my hair moisturized and soft! with a nice tangerine scent!! Its awesome! Hands down
1968,1,"Good clay_I use it as a foot soak and a face mask. I recently bought the Living Clay which can be used internally to detox my body.  Since I cannot use it for internal detox (my main reason for clay), I would not buy it again, but it is good for foot soaks."
8756,1,Beautiful Colors!!!_Just love this polish. The colors are vivid. One coat provides great coverage. Good price. Fast shipping. I liked this polish so much I sent a set to my daughter too. The husband noticed my nails in the green shade and said it was the prettiest polish he'd ever seen me wear :) I highly recommend this polish!!
3652,1,"Excellent face wash_I use this with my Clairsonic Mia 2, I have very oily acne prone skin and I use this suck all the oil out of face at night so its a blank canvas to absorb all my bed time moisturizers! Only thing I will say is try to avoid it spilling down to your eyes because of the tea tree it does leave a tingling effect! I have accidentally let run down my eyes while using my clairsonic in the shower, other than that I love this product!!"
4615,1,"love this color_Goes on smoothly. Always remember to do a 2 thin coats, and last 3 weeks. Don't regret investing in the shellac line"
2051,1,Benefits Cosmetics paste is perfect!_The Benefits Cosmetics paste is perfect for my dark circles. This product matches my skin tone perfectly. I have been searching for a concealer that looks natural and this concealer is my favorite! I got the medium color. I will continue to use this product forever. I recommend this product to Amazon's customers. The price is great and the shipping is fast...
1515,1,"Nice beginner's peel._Came with good instructions. Not too strong. I apply with a good quality 'fan brush' from the art store. I lasted about 20 seconds with the first one. The second one was probably about 50 seconds (after steaming). Third one was a little over a minute. Helps release clogged pores, but not as well as I would like. I am using this one to work up to a stronger peel.[...]"
7922,1,The colors are beautiful_I love the way it brings it in a box all organized. When it came I was so excited but when I opened it some gems were mixed but it was like only 10 gems. These gems are smaller than the usual ones that you see. These are made for small and long nails. I love the colors. I do recommend this to people that love doing their nails especially even if you have short nails like me.
2651,1,"Garnier Skin Renew Anti-Puff Eye Roller_I've been using this on my eye area for two years now.  I do not experience the puffiness that I notice on others (filled bags).  It works for me, but everyone is different so I can not attest to the results others may have using the product.  I also place the product around my mouth where laugh-lines are.  I do not have deep crevices there."
9832,1,Hair Serum_This is a great hair serum. I use it as a leave in conditioner. It only takes a little and won't leave your hair greasy.  It is also light enough to use on your face!
9361,1,"Healing serum that also keeps skin in better shape_My wife loved this serum.  She applied it over a period of time every evening and followed with a moisturizer.  The effects are noticeable.Hyaluronic acid is found in most cells in the human body.  It's greatest concentrations are in skin tissue.  Younger skin has more of it, however one can use supplements and this topical serum to boost hyaluronic acid's wonderful effects on skin.I recommend this serum for dry and also oily skin.  Hyaluronic acid helps dry skin stay moisturized and also helps prevent excessive oil production.  Sample provided for review."
2690,1,"Like this_I have been using this product for 5 weeks and am very happy with the results. I still have some cleanser and eye cream left but wanted to go ahead and write a review. I have oily skin and large pores. Some wrinkles around the eyes and a large one on the forehead.Cleanser: Nothing too special here. I am not a fan of the smell but I'll use it until I run out and then purchase a different one (probably Murad Clarifying cleaner, best I've tried so far).Eye cream: I like the light texture of this. I used it at night but I also used the anti-wrinkle cream around my eyes. I do think that my eye wrinkles may have diminished slightly but the bumps under my eyes are still there.Anti-wrinkle cream with SPF: I really liked this cream. It came in a metal tube and was very thick when it came out. It smooths out wonderfully though, feels really light and is not greasy/shiny at all. Especially when so many SPF creams smell like sunscreen and make your face shiny I was really happy with it. Can't say it did too much for the wrinkles but I don't really expect an instant result. Most trials are 8-12 weeks. Because I like the feel of this cream, I will probably repurchase it and use it for longer."
1829,1,"Awesome brand that really works!_All of the Village Naturals Mineral Bath Soaks that I've purchased have actually done what they claim to do. My husband has severely bad allergies. He's one of the unfortunate people who needs pills, nasal spray, and shots and still gets rashes, watery eyes, and a runny nose when doing so much as mowing the lawn. We spent a full day out doors cutting down tree branches, chipping the wood, pulling weeds, and planting. At the end of the day his limbs were pretty red and itchy. He used this in the bath and his skin was completely soothed. I've reviewed others of these and mentioned that my husband doesn't buy into much in the way of natural medicine, so the fact that he likes these speaks highly of their ability to do what they claim. The scent is strong in a good way, very relaxing and stays aromatic throughout the entire length of the bath. On days when my mild allergies act up, I will plug up the tub and sprinkle some of these before I take a shower. I get the benefits of the scented oils without having to sit in a bath. The containers are plastic and sturdy. I've ordered five so far and all of them have arrived in perfect condition. This would be an awesome &#34;Get Well&#34; gift for someone with a bad cold. I'd highly recommend this bath soak for anyone with allergies, mild or severe."
9948,1,"Two very enthusiastic thumbs WAY, WAY up!!_My under eye area is very puffy. I hate that!! I feel that ages me so much.  I&#8217;ve been using my new gel for the last two weeks,  I&#8217;ve noticed much less puffiness. I know that the bags will never totally disappear, BUT I&#8217;m thrilled with the decrease that I&#8217;m seeing. So much less puffy. Even my daughters commented on how good my eyes looked! My entire eye area looks AWAKE, refreshed and firmer!!One pump easily does both eyes.  I use a second pump for my neck.  I&#8217;m thoroughly impressed with InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel. Two very enthusiastic thumbs WAY, WAY up!!"
6865,1,"Great price, Works Well_Great little clipper.  It took forever (I mean over a month) to arrive, but for the price, I can't complain.  Works very well on false nails.  Happy with purchase."
3510,0,"NO_IT MADE ME BREAKOUT, CLOGGED SKIN AND I LOOKED TIRED AND UGLY,  THINK ITS THE RETIN A STAY AWAY IF U WANNA LOOK GOOD"
206,1,Great Serum_People always ask me what I use on my face.  I love it!  I put this on day and night. At night I use a thick jojoba moisturizer.
5867,1,"NYX hd foundation_This foundation is great with one caveat - it has such pink undertones that I cannot find a match for my skin. Even if I mix colors. Also, the swatches online look nothing like the actual stuff. However, if you have pink undertones it's a nice foundation. It's buildable and somehow manages to still look like skin. I took one star off because it seems to break me out if I wear it for a few days in a row."
8489,1,"Good Value_At $7 this Axe 'Messy Look' hair product is a good value (compared to the price of other hair products I purchase).  I've used it a few times myself just to change up my look a bit from my normal lay flat hairgel.  This Messy does create kind of a cool hair look.  My son also likes it (since is hair is messy anyway).  Scent is decent, non-irritating, washes out easy.I would buy again, overall 5-stars from me for price/value."
804,1,"jo jo from baltimore_Received it today, only need a small amount, which I mix with my St Ives Collagen Moisturizing Cream, sinks in fast , good on my sixty year old dry areas, feels comfortable also!"
424,1,Very creamy lotion_I really like this body lotion because it is very creamy and smooth when I put it on my skin. I like that it is unscented as it doesn't bother my allergies.
789,1,Wonderful_This Leave in Conditioner worked great on my curly hair and used all the time after washing and just put it in style and leave in it... smells good and I'm very satisfied with this product.
8115,0,"Cristophe Professional Volumizing Spray Tonic, aesthetically pleasing package, mediocre results_Any hair product that advertises 'adds volume' or 'adds fullness' to fine, limp hair, I buy! The inside of my cluttered bathroom cabinet attests to that fact! So Cristophe Professional Volumizing Spray Tonic was a 'must get.'  The product arrived to me, an excited consumer. When I saw the an aesthetically pleasing red/grayish color combination of the bottle, I couldn't wait to try it. The bottle itself is durable, especially in consideration of the relatively low-cost factor of the spray.Obviously the package put me in a positive frame of mind, and I expected a product that delivers great big hair. I must say, I followed the directions, sprayed the product directly onto my roots, gave it the old college try--on both dry and wet hair--over and over, but achieved no dramatic effects of any kind. No smell, no effect, no nothing. Yes, hair is not left sticky or stiff, but you might as well save a few dollars and use nothing, `cause nothing plus nothing really equals a big fat goose egg, but no big fat hair.Stacy Lytwyn, Marketing Guru/Motivational Speaker/JournalistAuthor: CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT: DAY TRIPS WITH PANACHEAce Blogger: WTF: Where's the Faith, [...]"
4896,1,"My all time favorite!_I love the creaminess of this product. It does the job quickly , smells great and lasts an unbelievably long time."
617,1,Good bye_I really like how it smells and how you don't get chunks of gel caught in your hair. I'm sure you'll like it too. (Medium shine)
7528,1,Fast!_They use this in my salon and I had to get some.  Not only does it dry fast it is very shiny.  I use it every couple of days to keep my manicure/acrylic nails fresh looking.  You don't need to pay the exorbitant cost of gel nails ($30 for plain in my area every two weeks)  if you put this over your regular polish frequently.
7693,1,Miracle in a bottle!!_OMG...I love this stuff!!  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for cheaper than from my Avon Rep.  Since using this product (this is my second bottle) my skin has just become softer than when I was in high school and I definitely have less little lines.  My husband has  even noticed!  I just love this product and would readily recommend it for anyone.  I am sooooo hooked on this Anew Genics!
421,1,good facial cleanser_This is the first time I have used this Neutrogena Foaming Cleanser.  In the past I have used Shiseido facial cleaning products which are a lot more expensive.  So far I have liked Neutrogena's light fragrance and it does do a great job removing all make up.  I do remove my eye make up using the Neutrogena towelettes before I use the foaming cleanser.
5160,1,Good facial cream_This is really soft. Makes your skin baby smooth. Just remember to wash your face and use a pore cleanser then this to make it even more effective. Beware of friends that may pet you after using this.
7558,1,"Bought at walmart_This product seems to work better than the Jergen's in my opinion.  The bronzing is gradual and as long as you keep your hands washed after applying then you won't look orange.  The dry skin around a couple of my fingers is the only place that appears orangeish.  It does have a tanning lotion smell.  It actually smells exactly like the bombshell tingling tanning lotion.  It doesn't bother me too bad since I wear it at night to bed and not during the day, but my husband said it stunk."
7853,1,"Travelin' Bag_Disclosure: I was contacted by David Hoffman--yes! the very same David, the one who's been here, and apparently there, too--who asked me if I'd like to try out some of his wares.  I opted for atravel tripod(reviewed) and this toiletries case, and promised a fair and honest review in return.First, some history.  In 1982 my parents gave me a small, maroon, sail-canvas duffle, and that thing has been my toiletries carrier for the past 30-odd years. It's slightly worn, yes, but has never, ever failed me.  It's always been big enough for all of my gear, and has even been able to withstand the onslaught of additional stuff after I got married.  Even in those events when the baggage handler abuse has caused packages and tubes to split and spill, this little bag has kept it all inside, with no leaks or spills.So, this toiletries kit has got a formidable challenge.  And it's done pretty well.I'm just back from a weekend away, and for the first time since 1982 my red bag stayed at home.All of my stuff fit inside this bag with no problems at all.  Previously I've just thrown everything into a single bag; I was now forced to actually decide upon which of the four compartments to use, which did end up taking more time to pack.Once packed, the bag has to lay flat--that's its design.  So, you've got to plan accordingly to leave the requisite flat space in  your suitcase.  The ability to roll this thing, and even tie it together as a roll would be cool.  Sew on a couple of sturdy nylon ties and that capability is in place.Once to the hotel, unpacking was easy.  I note that in both packing and unpacking, when the center compartment is open, the lower part of the S-hook hangs right smack in the middle of the opening for the upper mesh pouch.  This gets in the way of putting things in, getting them out, and closing the pouch's zipper.  Something needs to be done to get this hook out of the way.  The bag hung well in the bathroom, from a robe hook.  But, the S-hook is not nearly big enough to go over a door--maybe some kind of L-shaped hook that would fit over a door might make this thing a little better . . . but then again the strap for the hook would have to be a foot or two long to get the bag back down into arm's range . . . I dunno.  I'll let David's army of travel-engineers sort this out.I like the zip-out compartment on the right.  You make it big for lots of stuff, and can zip it in (to match the size of the compartment on the left) if you've only got a few things.My red bag is washable, and consequently isn't nearly as red as it was 30 years ago.  Every few years or so the bag does need washing, and especially if you've had a viscous blowout.  I did not wash this product, but upon close inspection I see nothing that would prevent me from doing so.  It appears to be all nylon, so a hand wash would not be too bad on it.  A simple rinse to get rid of exploded shampoo would be no problem.  It even appears sturdy enough to run through the washing machine, on Delicate, of course, hang-dry only.Color: The dark battleship gray with black hardware is pretty hard-core, but not very inspiring.  A dark blue with black hardware would be cool, as would a red bag with black, a dark green, etc.  The dark gray screams utilitarian and stoically capable, but doesn't really get anywhere near fun or exciting.Bottom line: Will I use this again?  Yup.  It has not quite supplanted the bag I've been using for decades, but this thing has a few innovations that a canvas bag does not.  I'll keep using it, and I'll have my wife and kids take it for a spin, too, and I'll provide updates as needed.-------------------Update: 11 May 2013:Congrats, Dave, as this is my new traveling kit--the switch is permanent.But, I have some additional observations, having used this on a few more trips now.First, the hook that allows you to hang this needs to be physically bigger.  Specifically, the radius of the hook needs to expand by at least 1/2', to allow it to be hung from the variously sized bars you find in hotels.Second, rather than a nylon strap, the hook needs a swivel.  Right now when you hang it, the flat strap tends to make it want to twist.  A swivel will prevent that.Third, the hook really needs some kind of retaining strap or keeper that you can tuck it into when it's time to zip up the bag.This is good kit, sure, but just needs some additional work."
4732,1,"Nice and sudsey, clean smell!_I have itchy dry skin that nothing seems to help. I started using this the Restoraderm products and have found relief! This is a great body wash as it lathers nicely and has a clean smell!"
6427,1,"Great buy_Wish there could be some made out of metal, or wood, or even rubber. But, if you are in need of some quick eyelash work, these are great! They are sturdy and get the job done. I personally got them to dip in castor oil then to apply to my eyelashes so they grow."
2324,1,Perfect!_Works like a charm! Just add a few drops and thick goopy nail polish becomes new again.  I no longer have to throw out old nail polish
5016,0,"I've been using it for 4 days_So far not impressed! I don't know maybe too soon to actually see any results. I bought this because of all the good reviews ppl claiming saw results right away. No tightening effects what so ever. The smell is not as everyone makes it out to be, but I'm not gonna lie at first it smelled like fish food mixed with skunk. The smelled  went away for me after 2 days.  If it really works I could care less about what it smells like.  I plan on continuing to use the cream until it runs out. I'm hoping in seeing results soon,but if I don't another disappointment for me when it comes to expensive creams."
1287,1,"New favorite purple_This has definitely made it into my top favorite polishes list. I've used it for several different manicures including layered under glitters, has the base coat for stamping, and just by itself. And I love it more each time I use it! It's a cream polish that gives good coverage with 2 coats, goes on super smooth. I definitely recommend this for nail polish collections!"
4568,1,"Image Vital C Hydrating Anti Aging Serum, 1.7 Fluid Ounce_I like the product because of its fragrance and its smoothness. I need it to take care of my sensitive skin."
6207,1,Love them_Not only are these functional but they are so pretty too. Use these for simple nail art and they work great.
4352,0,"need lighter_I should have bought a lighter shade. Make me look Orange not a fan art all, suits on counter not being used"
8227,0,"hurts_this got caught in my hair and pulled a bunch out... it's not very flexable, and honestly the clasps holding the flowers together are just not good... its cute, just not wearable."
2659,1,natural_It smell really good and lasts a long time. It's not drying and best of all it's all natural. yeay!
8867,1,"FAST, better results, no burning_This was my first curling iron that didn't have the alligator clasp style, and I wasn't sure how well it would work. However, it far exceeded my expectations. Here are the ups and downs that I've noticed:PROS:--Hand wrapping the hair around the barrel provides a more natural curl shape and more even heat distribution.--It doesn't overheat/burn your hair, partly because of the hand wrapping, and partly because it's ceramic.--It heats up very quickly, has different heat settings, and has a digital readout of the current temperature. That's definitely a first for me.--My hair actually curled with this! I have straight hair that doesn't hold a curl well with a metal curling iron, but for whatever reason, with this one it did. This makes bigger, natural looking curls.--The cord is a decent length for ease of use if your plug isn't right next to your mirror.CONS:--If you're buying this (I got mine on Vine), it's a little expensive. However, I compared the price with similar devices at Target, and it is a much better price on Amazon. Also, you do get what you pay for. I'm very late in writing this review and have had mine for some time now, and it's holding up perfectly.--Don't lose the glove!! If you lose the heat resistant glove that comes with this, you're basically screwed. I wish it came with several, as it's bound to get lost.--Even though it heats up super fast (like seconds), it's going to take some time to do all the wrapping, and there's definitely a learning curve. It will be tricky at first, but you'll get the hang of it over time."
8924,1,Super convenient_My hair dresser suggested using this product so I didn't have to dye my roots so often. I LOVE IT. It gives great coverage and I can cut my dying frequency in half.
5091,1,"What's up with all the bad reviews? I love this curling iron!_I don't understand all the bad reviews. I have used my curling iron numerous times, and it doesn't take a long time for it to heat up, and I always get good results when I use it. I absolutely love this curling iron! The price is the best I could find online. I'm happy with it!"
7074,1,Nice product for cheap_You can watch you tube for the how tos there are no instructions but for under a dollar I am happy! I guess I ordered during a holiday so it take a bit longer almost a full month it was not late though.
2698,1,"Goodbye Dry/Cracked Hands!_I am always on the lookout for a good hand lotion that doesn't leave me feeling greasy yet repels water. Not an easy task, but this Vaseline Body Lotion w/ Aloe come REALLY close to achieving that goal.Smells great, soaks in within minutes and you are good to go. The bottle has a great push stopper that lets you easily dispense the amount you need without touching anything else other than the top of it.I could FEEL this lotion start doing it's thing almost instantly. NO allergic reactions, no stinging and no greasy residue a few minutes after application. After one week of use I have noticed a definite improvement in my chapped and cracked hands. It DOES have fragrance ingredients in the formula and for some that may be a deal breaker, otherwise you should have no issues.  Shop around for the best price, but the product itself is well worth seeking out.Good stuff!"
607,1,Very hydrating._I use the regenerist microsculpting cream on most of my face and the night recovery cream around my eyes at night because I find it is very hydrating. Would be perfect for all over the face night cream if you have dry skin.  I use all the Regenerist products; GREAT products for the money.
860,0,"Bad or fake item received_I received a box of Casmir from Amazon. It smelled terrible, just terrible. It most certainly WAS NOT an oriental vanilla. I subsequently ordered a sample vial of Casmir from a very reputable perfume dealer online. Guess what? That one WAS an oriental vanilla, and it smelled nothing like the Casmir that I received from Amazon.I've read numerous product reviews on Amazon with claims that the perfumes were fake. I always dismissed these, assuming that people did not know what they were talking about. However, I can assure you that these claims, which are numerous, are true: Amazon is selling either fake perfumes or bad perfumes. Unfortunately, this is not the first time that I received a bad item from Amazon. I have received at least 3 bad items, perhaps more. Clearly, something is wrong with the suppliers that they use.My strong advice is to refuse to accept any open box item or any item that does not smell as it should from Amazon. If necessary, order a $1-$3 sample from one of the perfume vendors to compare. For me, moving forward any beauty item that I receive is under the microscope, and I will not purchase any high end perfumes from Amazon. Never, ever, never."
2511,1,"Clear base with lovely small glitter!_Love this - it will be perfect over my blah creme colors like white and light pink, or even for the holidays!"
9784,1,Great Cleanser!_I have used several cleansing sets trying to find the right one for me......finally I've found it. This wash leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed. It is simple and refreshing. I checked to see if there was any make up residue left afterwards and was very glad not to find any. I also  had my almost teenage daughter use it after I realized the other product she was using was making her face flare up and  she has had amazing results. About to order my third bottle. Thanks for a great product!
5102,1,love it_Produces where great. Bought more then one and price was not bad. Love it. I recommend this product. A+ excellent buy.
507,1,"I'll never use any other powder_This powder is perfect! It sets my makeup, absorbs excess oil and I even use it after I conceal blemishes but before I add bronzer and blush. I also love that it doesn't lighten the face and really lives up to the &#34;translucent&#34; it touts. You won't regret this buy!"
2122,1,"Very nice wrinkle fighter...and a little bit goes a long way_I use this night cream in conjunction withPeter Thomas Roth's Laser-Free Resurfacer with Dragon's Blood Complexevery night before bedtime.  It goes on very smoothly and it only takes a tiny amount to smooth over your skin, which is a good thing since it's not an inexpensive moisturizer.  In fact, the cream has a stiff enough consistency in its small container that when you run your finger over the surface, only a small amount comes away...so it is actually a bit difficult to use too much.This un-wrinkle night cream contains retinol, glycolic acid, vitamins, and skin moisturizers. It's formulated to support natural cell turnover, repair daily environmental damage, minimize the appearance of pores, retain moisture, and revitalize skin while you sleep.  I'm really happy with the results that the PTR skincare products are giving my skin.I would have rated it 5 stars, but the one thing I don't care for is the shine that it gives my face for quite a while after applying."
9930,1,"Bomb_Love love love this line, I have all the treatment, this acne wash has helped me get my beautiful bright, blemish free skin that I have been striving for years. You can tell a difference within a short period. Its gentle enough to use everyday and its moisturizing."

2060,0,only ok_I found this cream to leave a waxy feeling on my face. it moisturizes and it certainly adheres to the skin. i am not so crazy about this cream.  I dont notice any smell or irritation with this cream although others have mentioned it.I much prefer the jasmine scented Alba Hawaiian cream.
9806,1,"lightens dark patches on face!!_I was excited to receive these oils to try, I use the  rosehip seed oil in a rose petal salve and used it on my elbows and they have stayed soft for along time!  vitamin C is used to hydrate the skin and hoping to lighten the dark patches on my face. And using the argan oil for shinier hair!!"
1273,1,"Light lovely fragrant_This is one of my favorite perfume that I wear all the time because it smells so good on me. The scent is very light and not over powering. It is a mix of apple, lavender and amber. The scent last for a good eight hours and you will get alot of compliments every time you wear this perfume. I recommend this perfume for anybody who wants to smell lovely and don't want a fragrant that people can smell before you reach and stay behind after you already left."
1422,1,"Fantastic smell, steep price for bubble bath_I love the smell of bergamot, and the tart grapefruit was the perfect accompaniment for a nice long bath. I would call what this product creates more &#34;suds&#34; than &#34;bubbles,&#34; but it still does the job. I do wish it didn't cost so much---it seems like an awful lot for a fairly basic product. I think I'll try making some at home myself next time."
3518,1,"Lovely for drier skin_Radiant, buildable, and great for drier skin. The color is very nice on this one, not quite as pearly white as some other BBs. The cheek stain is a very wearable color, as well."
2527,1,"So far, so good_I've only used this once or twice but so far it's pretty good. I was using Flat to Volume by Pantene but I think it was drying my hair out"
7231,1,"Awesome tool for a beginner_I've recently developed an interest in nail art beyond just the basic manicure. While I'm still new at it, I've found these brushes to be quite helpful with clean up as well as decoration. I get clean, crisp lines, and they're very easy to store and clean up after use. For the price, an awesome value and necessary addition to the collection of anyone interested in nail art!"
6745,1,"Love It!_This is a great pallete. I have crepy eye lids and the colors look very smooth and natural. I usually wear these shadows for a very natural, subtle day look but this pallet is also great for a smokey eye. I also really like the blushes which apply very smoothy. I have purchased several of these and also have given them as gifts."
2920,1,"This beauty bar is typical of Dove products_I do like this Shea Butter beauty bar, but find I like the normal Dove soap just as well.  I thought maybe the shea butter style would give me more moisture, but the regular soap works, too.  If you like Dove products, then give this a try.  Otherwise, I would stick to the usual Dove soap."
7154,1,Nice but does have artifical coloring in it_The color is nice on my lips but I recommend you use a lip brush.  Please note that it has menthol in it if that is an issue with you.  It has Wheat germ oil in it too if that is an issue. Also it has a very naturalish taste and smell and at first it tasted like sage to me but I looked on the ingredients and apparently what I am tasting is Rosemary.  If you just used for a lipstick and used a brush this would last a LONG time.  If you use as blush as well it will cut the life of the tube in half.  I did put on my cheeks and it is to fat to just move it across your cheeks and I got to much.  I just used my hand to move some to other cheek.  Color was natural.  Took star off for Red dyes and menthol.
9489,1,"LOVE this Product!!_The Virgin Argan Oil is a great buy. Your skin and hair will thank you for investing into the Virgin Argan Oil product.  The Virgin Argan Oil for Hair & Face Treatment from the BeBeLush Beauty Company worked miracles on my hair. My hair was extremely damaged from dying it and blowing drying it so much. My split ends were outrageous, their was no depth or volume in my hair when I styled it. Besides from all the split ends I had a great amount of burnt roots from the bleaching and dying my hair constantly. I was always experimenting with my hair, I guess that&#8217;s a fault I have always trying something new with my hair. However, the Virgin Argan Oil product worked really well for me. My hair looks extremely healthy. I have been using the product for about two week s now, and I have fewer split ends and damage roots. I noticed lately my hair has more depth and volume to it. The BeBeLush Beauty Company made the Argan Oil a multi purpose product.After only a few short weeks of using the product you will see for yourself how amazing it is. So why not get better skin and hair sooner than later?Disclosure: I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion. To read the rest of my review, please visit the blog (Krazy Coupon Club)! Above is just a small portion of my thoughts."
6848,1,"Love it_This one is very easy to use and perfect, i comb my hair and simply up-do  it like a hairstylist."
3815,1,"Eyeshadow & Blush_The colors are generously pigmented without appearing chalky. The blushes are gorgeous, a few of the eye shadows and a few of the blushes have flex in them, which provides shimmer. However, the shimmer isn't overbearing or over-the-top dramatic. The palette is a reasonable size and is easily transported during trips."
2568,1,"Perfect for detailing_I ordered these brushes because I needed finer, thinner bristles for nail art detailing. These work perfectly. I don't really use the longer bristled brush (the green one), but I use the other two for pretty much all of my nail art detailing and freehand nail painting."
1501,1,"Stopped biting my nails_I have been biting my nails for as long as I remember. I wanted to stop so I purchased this back in December. I did have to apply it every couple of days but after 2 weeks...I don't bite my nails anymore.My only complaint is that this stuff is so powerful that you can't really eat small things with your hands without making your food taste terrible. On the other hand, it is also a good way to curb that Cheetos habit ;)"
5341,1,"Pretty color_This is definitely a color you would not expect to be used as a gel liner. Very bright and bold, but i love it. I also have this gel liner in black. It came with the little brush, but i threw it out and used my own. The one downfall of this particular liner is, it smears easy (at least i think it does). I've gone to rub my eyes many times and it got all over my fingers, the same goes for the black liner as well. I also have trouble taking it off easily with my makeup remover. I use the Loreal makeup remover, so it might work better if i used something a bit stronger."
9981,1,"Dead Sea Salt Soap is very moisturing and has a nice light scent_I found the soap to have a very pleasing scent, and rich and moisturizing lather. It made my skin feel soft and left no residue. I have sensitive skin and the soap was very mild and didn't irritate my face at all. Had to hide the soap from my kids because they loved it so much they kept stealing it out of my shower."
814,1,"Best night cream ever._Unbelievable.  Wish I had found this during the winter!  I didn't realize how thick it was so I used a little much last night....shared with my husband too after I did my arms.  It felt so good and made my face (and arms) so soft and hydrated.  I thought my dry skin would get less dry as summer got here, but it didn't.  Great stuff."
8826,1,"Good price_Olay never seems to fail, always a solid body wash with maximum hydration.Does not dry out skin, but the shea butter smell was moderate which is why I took 1 star away."
9582,1,"Basic lotion, strong scent_The lotion does what you would expect, I wouldn't call it anything different than an ordinary lotion. The scent is not really what I would prefer, but it works."
2212,1,"I like it_This stuff works really well for me. The thing you need to keep in mind with this that I had to learn is that you really need to apply it to nails that are still wet. If you wait until the polish dries and then apply it, it tends to shrink and pull away from the cuticles which looks weird and then leads to chipping. Apply it while polish is still wet and your poilish will dry pretty fast and it makes a nice protective top coat."
3750,1,"Great for damaged hair_Love the Moroccanoil products. This is great for damaged hair, and a little goes and extremely long way. If you have fine hair I would recommend the extra body conditioner."
5556,1,"Love This Lavender_This is my very favorite color!  This Xtreme Wear nail polish by Sally Hansen is just great.  It will last two weeks if you add ridge filler underneath it.  I have no wearing, no peeling, and no chipping.  You must also put a good top coat on.  I recommend it highly."
2488,1,Haven't found a better argon product_I tried a few other brands that were less expensive because I do love the oil. This brand is pricier but definitely the best. I use it mostly I'm my bleached hair but it is a great body oil and facial cleanser too.
9140,1,"Softest Brush Ever_This brush is the softest make up brush I have ever owned. I deep cleaned it with conditioner which made it even softer, it applies my concealer perfectly and I do not regret buying this product whatsoever. I highly recommend this for an amateur AND a professional make up artist, great brush."
7508,0,"crap_The packaging and the glitter is cheap, glitter is too bulky for nail application.Will be giving to my young daughter for art."
2808,1,"Strong smelling lotion_This lotion is nice, thick and feels great on the body. However, the fragrance is very strong, similar to the smell of baby lotion. It does make your skin feel much softer and smoother. The lotion absorbs quickly into the skin and goes on smoothly. As for its body firming abilities, the jury is still out."
3896,1,"Lovely_Smells lovely, make sure if you use it on your body you use a carrier oil...a little goes a long way"
4243,0,"dont even try to shapen it, its a pain ..._dont even try to shapen it, its a pain in the ass. not waterproof at all. just a normal eyeliner pencil. meh"
5072,1,"Keeps hair strong but not for scalp_This oil is designed to keep hair follicles strong, however it can clog your pores and your scalp will itch if applied. I only apply it to my hair and avoid applying it to my scalp as much as I can. My hair is stronger and thicker because of this oil."
6435,1,"nice pump_I like automatic pumps and my only complaint about them would be that I manage to trigger the pump when I am cleaning my countertops, a minor issue. Fun for teens to use. Great gift for a teen girl. Not so sure the scents would appeal to a teen boy as it includes a pink bottle of super fruit splash. Would not recommend for those sensitive to dyes and perfumes. Contains 2% salicylic acid."
9124,1,"Great disposable Cartridges_This razor is really good for a disposable.  The cartridges last a long  time and you get 6 or 8 with each new handle, which is also disposable.  There are 3 blades in each one so you get a nice close shave.  Its more economical than the regular disposables because it lasts as long as a regular cartridge, without the cuts you get from a cheap disposable."
9477,1,"Reasonably Priced Paddle Brush_I didn't think I would like this brush because I have purchased other Ecotools products (sold at Walgreens) and haven't been impressed.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I love using a big paddle brush for my hair versus the big round brush because it is easier and faster to style my hair.  I have a favorite paddle brush that I have had for years but it is getting old and it does not have vents.  This brush looked interesting because it does have vents but it is made of wood and plastic, not metal.  I used it to style my hair which is short and although this brush is rather big, I was able to style my hair and in a shorter time due to the vents.As I said before, I am not that impressed with Ecotools products but I do like this brush and although I still have my other paddle brush, this one is a good replacement should I decide to retire my other one-NOT.  LOL"
9866,1,"An Excellent Hyaluronic Acid Serum with Lilac Stem Cells_I've started to use this serum and my skin is beautiful! I'm really seeing a difference- my skin is soft, smooth and firm. And I particularly love it because it's repairing some of my skin damage from being a sun worshipper for so many years. I can't imagine how great it's going to look after using this product over a longer period of time! I'm also ecstatic that it has been gentle on my sensitive skin while still being effective at making me look and feel younger. I'm glad I ordered this Hyaluronic Acid Serum witih Lilac Stem Cells to add to my anti-aging arsenal. Thanks for the awesome product!"
8533,1,"Cleans Efficiently. Smells Pretty, But Fragrance Is Too Strong._It's hard to know for sure exactly what a shampoo is doing for your hair, because the conditioner you use has more effect on the final look and feel of your hairstyle. This shampoo lathers up nicely, and it gets my hair squeaky clean with only one washing. No need to rinse and repeat. So even though it's expensive, I'm using half the amount I use with cheaper shampoos that require two washings. I may even be using less than half, because this gets such a good lather that I only need to use a small amount. What this means is that I'll go through the shampoo and conditioner at about the same rate. Usually I run out of shampoo way before I use up its matching conditioner.This shampoo smells very pretty, sort of like a combination of candy and perfume, but it's way too strong. Fortunately I haven't had a bad reaction to the fragrance, as I sometimes do, but it needs to be dialed down considerably. Granted, my nose is more sensitive than most people's, but I think even average sniffers might find this a bit too heavily perfumed."
8871,1,"Have To Get Use To_We do use curling irons in this house, although most of us have some natural curl already in our hair. I was excited to see how this product would perform. There are some things that I did not like. First was that there was no clamp to help hold the hair in place. I found it hard to not be burnt without that. They did include a glove, which was good, but for me a clamp would be better. It heated up quickly and I mean it was hot. However there are different settings for the heat, you just have to find the right one for the wave you are going for. I did get some  nice loose waves that held up. I think this would work well once I get the hang of it and perhaps purchase another glove so I have one for both my hands. I do not recommend this for a young person, I think they could easily get burnt without the help of a clamp while doing their hair.  Bottom line it does what it says it will do."
1564,0,"Not sure..._I didn't know what to do with this spray. It is supposed to add moisture and frizz control, but instead it felt as if it left a sticky, oily layer on my hair so that when I went to move my hair, pieces of my hair were stuck together which caused more frizz. Maybe this product wasn't meant for my type of curls?"
7326,1,"A Fresh Breath For Skin_I am a Philosophy Girl & have been for about 9 years now. I started with Purity Made Simple & Hope In A Jar and still use them to this day. When this cream came out, my skin was feeling dull and lacking a glow. I have combination skin, but rarely break out anymore. I bought this and after cleansing with Microdelivery Wash & using the When Hope Is Not Enough Serum, I used it. It literally felt like my skin had been renewed! Like when you take a deep breath (perfect product name!) I now use this in the AM with my Microdelivery Wash, the AM Miracle Worker Pads & my WHINE serum. My skin looks amazing. I alternate between Hope In A Jar & Miracle Worker moisturizers at night. I highly recommend giving this a try if your skin has just been feeling dull, lackluster or you're looking for a good moisturizer. It infuses oxygen into the skin and feels wonderful! I also do the Microdelivery Peel (the new 12 week one) once a week. Philosophy changed my skin, let it change yours, my skin looks better now than it did at 20!!"
6436,1,"Perfect!!_This soap does what it says and delivers. It's not drying it clears the skin, my skin tone is beautiful and clear. I have been using this soap for 2 weeks, and I just placed my 2nd order. I saw results from using this product after 3 days!!! The soap is not drying, it's actually hydrating no chemicals which is the #1 priority for me!!  However, it dissolves really quickly but the only thing you need to do is place the soap on a bamboo soap holder which will allow the product to breath.  Also delivery is really fast I received my first order 4 days after ordering. Great Product!!!"
748,1,"This stuff removes Shellac. u have to have it!_I use this at home to do my own Shellac.... I've already gone through one bottle of this..... I ordered 2 bottles..... It's the only thing that removes shellac. take my advise, do shellac at home yourself. just order this to remove it."
9144,0,"Meh_I didn't care for this product. It dries way too fast to apply to skin, doesn't peel off well, and takes your facial hair with it. 5 stars for hair removal!"
2214,1,"Like it!_I really like this, my only complaint is once you get close to the end of the bottle it's hard to get out- I dont think the brush is quite long enough and it gets kind of thick and gooey at the end of the bottle. The first 1/2 works great and then it's not as fabulous the 2nd half of the bottle. I will still use it because it's the best top coat I have found, but if I found something better that wasn't so thick and gooey at the end then I might try it"
2027,1,"Without a doubt..._The best lotion I've ever used. Non-greasy, yet very moisturizing. I believe someone compared the scent to SweetTarts candy...very accurate in my opinion -- orangey-sweet smell, but not overpowering. The only partial negative would be the price is high for everyday lotion. But it does last quite a while and it is a quality product. I plan on purchasing a bottle for each of my female relatives as part of their Christmas presents. Maybe creating more fans will bring the price down...just hopefully not the supply or quality."
9536,1,"smoothed out the damaged part of my hair_My hair is not thick, but it's rather long and it's damaged and dry and it takes a lot of conditioner to coat it, thus my main requirements for a conditioner are that 1) it's not expensive and 2) it moisturizes my hair and leaves it smooth and manageable. This one meets my price expectations, which I kind of expect from Suave and I was actually surprised at how well it did with making my hair look nice! It felt very slippery going on, so I thought it must be packed full of silicones (it is) so after I washed/conditioned my hair, I decided to ALSO use a little bit of this as a leave-in conditioner. It worked very well. Last year my hair suffered from some chemical damage/breakage in some front areas and there are some bits I stubbornly refuse to cut until they grow more and somehow they have miraculously not broken off yet and they sometimes feel rough and dry and crinkly (and just generally look bad) and I'm pretty impressed with how this conditioner smoothed them out. Even three days after last washing/conditioning my hair, I don't feel/see the damaged part.I do think there is too much silicone in here to use it every time, and I'm not thrilled with the smell (I don't even know how to describe it, the best I can do is &#34;cheap 1970s body lotion&#34;) but you don't really notice the smell once hair is dry (don't know if I'd want a date smelling my hair after this though...) Overall, pretty happy with it."
4100,1,"LOVE_I loved the color. It looked so natural and refreshing on me. It's really smooth, I just really loved it! But I've giving this product a 4 start only because it has to be reapplied every 2 hours or so for the fresh look. It's scary to think about applying a lead based substance on your lips (which you tend to lick and all throughout the day) several times a day."
8634,0,"Hair dryer_I returned the hair dryer.  I had nothing against the hair dryer, except I have a disability and it was too heavy for me."
4377,1,"Great white pencil!_I love it. Great for the lower lash line, to make my eyes look bigger. It's very opaque, it's very good.I will definitely repurchase this."
8705,1,"Radiant!_At night time before bed, I use Simple Radiance Cleansing Wipes. The packaging says they refresh skin and keep pores clean of impurities. These smelled kind of like witch hazel and aloe. They look and work similar to the Simple Oil Balancing Wipes, they just smell different. I noticed that they gave my skin a dewy, healthy look when I looked in the mirror the next morning. My skin looks flawless every morning, now. It leaves no residue and removed makeup from face and eyes without burning my eyes. My face feels healthy, protected, and soft and clean before bed. I also apply Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer after using the wipes. I would recommend these wipes for all skin types, these are really gentle yet shockingly effective. I got this for free from BzzAgent!!"
4457,0,"Ick, breakouts!_I know this is supposed to be for sensitive skin, and perhaps it's just that my skin has gotten picky over the years of only wearing Clinique products, but this really didn't work for me.When it arrived my Vine sticker was placed firmly over the ingredients - after much peeling and prodding and hot water I was able to only gunk up the ingredient list.  So I really can't speak to what is in the bottle.  I can say that I liked the pump, though I always feel like I'm missing the last little gobs in the bottom when I have a pump I can't remove.The product appears to me to be more of a primer to be used prior to adding your foundation to 'fill in' fine lines.  I don't see anything that would imply to me that it has any power to erase or lessen the fine lines any more then a basic moisturizer.  So basically this is just to fill in the lines before adding makeup.  The odor was strange, not bad, but certainly not attractive.  The consistancy was thick and it rubbed in rather well.The problem I encountered was an almost immediate breakout.  I won't be using it again because of this."
4206,1,Great Product!_This product really makes your skin feel soft and moist. I use it both in the morning and night!  I am on my third bottle and plan to continue using it indefinitely. I highly recommend you try it.  You can't go wrong...the price is vey reasonable.
1047,1,"Got acne? Try this._This witch hazel toner is 1/3 the price I usually pay for other facial toners. I When I saw this I was literally astounded. They're so cheap and affordable ($2.99 for a 16 fl oz bottle at my local Walgreen), not to mention it works fine. This soothes my acne prone irritated skin after I remove my make-up at night. It doesn't dry out my skin despite the fact it contains 14% of natural grain alcohol. Witch hazel is also great for acne. Besides, you should really apply less of chemical ingredients if your face is breaking out and start going natural. There's no added artifial fragrance either but I found the smell to be very fouling, but I can't really complain. This should last me a long time and I'll keep on buying this product unless there aren't going to be any change in ingredients and price."
9766,1,"High quality!_High quality makeup brushes are very soft, yet sturdy enough to adequately apply makeup.  Come in a well made case, perfect for travel. These are the best brushes I have ever used!"
6716,1,Great product_Love this product! Smells delicious and made my skin look amazing! I recommend this if you ever think of self tanning.
9483,1,Excellent for facial skin care and more_I  feel good about using this organic argan oil everyday to keep my skin moisturized and beautiful. It is nice that it is made by women-run cooperatives too. I like that it helps other women.  It is easy to use too....I just squeeze a few drops out morning and night and gently blend into my face and neck. I wake up in the morning looking fresh and dewy. My mom and sister love beauty gifts and this would be a lovely gift or part of a super beauty gift basket for anyone. It is already on my list for gifts.
5576,1,"Smells like citrus!_I hate the smell of sunscreen. Being pregnant I hate it even more. This has a light nice citrus smell, so much better than American sunscreen. No white cast. Nice and clear. Easy to blend into your face under your makeup! You can't the amount of SPF in this little baby! I use under my makeup and it's light enough to not clog my pores, and washes off with my cleanser! A staple in my makeup bag! I should've bought backups lol I will be ordering again soon! Love this!"
7336,1,"Good_A very decent product is not super long lasting but last enough and morethat a normal lip liner , very nice colors , soft and easy to use I completelyrecommend this product and for sure come back for more"
3430,1,Great_Love this. Comes with sleeve and case. Good quality of material. Price was higher than most. It is an unique item.
7160,1,"Excellent sunscreen_Well, there's not much negative to say about this sunscreen, perhaps the price is a little high.  But overall, it's an excellent sunscreen that's easy to apply, has no fragrance, and lasts a couple of hours.  Summer's coming and my wife and I will both be using this around the pool.  Hopefully the price will drop some."
5611,1,Looks awesome!_China Glaze Crackle Polish works great!!!! I love all the colors and this is a GREAT price!! I recommend this product!
478,0,Snapped in half_Brush snapped in half after less than two weeks of use...right where the handle joins the brush head.  Would not recommend.
8292,0,disappointed_I have been searching for the best...this is not it.  It makes my hair feel oily & I can only use it once a week at most.  Smells great though.
722,1,"Works well_I don't put heat on my hair anymore, but this worked well when I did,  My hair would probably look better if I would take the time to use this.  It is stuffed in a drawer somewhere?"
9167,1,"Great brush_This is a very sturdy product. It has a curved long handle so you can reach your entire back. The bristles are firm enough so you can really feel clean but still soft. I would definitely recommend this product. I might buy a few more to make Christmas baskets for family and friends. Also, I love anything pink being the only female in a house of 7 they will know for sure which one is moms!"
4957,1,"It works!_love the little bag, great for travelling! nice quality too. My only complaint is that the bristles of the eye shadow brush are a little too hard and hurt my eye."
6502,1,"Nice fragrance !_Lovely rose fragrance ,smells so good ,apply just a tiny amount that enough for a lasting fragrance all day long."
7609,1,Great color!_My daughter wanted this particular color and I ordered it for her. I have to admit that it looks phenomenal. The periwinkle color is out of this world and looks elegant and appropriate with practically any outfit.
7730,0,Didn't do a thing.  Waste of money._Used faithfully whole bottle but there was no improvement with my skin.  Did not live up to it's claim.  Save your money.
4897,1,"Great natural cleanser!_I decided to try this on a whim after reading some other reviews online. I usually use Clearasil, the non-medicated daily face wash, just to maintain my already (mostly) healthy skin. The one thing I didn't like about Clearasil was that it always left my face feeling dry. I would almost instantly have to put lotion on just to feel comfortable.When I first opened the bottle of the Yes To Carrots cleanser and put some in my hands, I was surprised that it didn't lather. I guess that's because it's 96% natural and doesn't have those harsh chemicals that make the other face washes lather. And yes, it does have a scent, but it's not perfume-y...it's more like a mix of vegetables or something strange like that. I don't love it, but it's not objectionable. Anyway, I put it on my face, and right away I was pleasantly surprised. It felt good! I rubbed it in for a bit, then rinsed it off, as per the instructions. When I patted my face dry with a towel, I couldn't believe how smooth and soft my skin felt! It didn't feel dry or tight at all! I actually had my boyfriend feel my face with his hand because I was so surprised. lol I didn't even have to use my usual facial moisturizer.I ordered the Yes to Carrots shampoo and conditioner, and I can't wait to try them. Definitely give this cleanser a try, it's worth the money, and I can already see that the bottle is going to last me for over a month, easily."
1172,1,"Love these makeup sponges!_I heard about these on a YouTube video. I love the way these apply my foundation, the little amount of foundation I put on. Also it helps blend my concealer, makes my makeup look totally finished. You can use dry, but best if they are wet, the makeup will absorb better.If you apply liquid foundation, you have to try these! You won't be sorry!!!"
6369,1,"Very nice :)_This wig is WELL worth the price! I just got it today. The color is gorgeous, and it looks very realistic. The only qualm I have with it is that it is a pretty thin wig, so I will most likely just wear this wig with a beanie hat from now on. Overall, very happy!"
1363,1,"True to color_I bought both the Amplified and the pot you see here. I used the Amplify for the first coloring and then mixed the pot in with my conditioner so I have a long lasting effect.  I get compliments, but that doesn't matter when you are green.  You feel fab in it anyway. Also Great shipping experience!"
4821,1,"NICE OIL!!_I personally love this oil!! Although I don't really care for the smell. Other than that I really did like it. It does seem to harden in colder temperatures due to the fact that it has coconut oil in it, but i just let the bottle sit in some warm/hot water for a few seconds and then applied to my scalp. I usually use it when I have braids and I would defiantly purchase it again."
4774,1,Love it_This arrived earlier then time and it work perfectly. I like the fact that your able to lock settings and can adjust the heat temperature.
4969,1,"Nice, pleasant smell and goes on light!_I use this now on an elderly patient who's bedridden when I change diapers and even she has commented on how good it smells.Also you save more when purchased through the 'Subscribe and Save' option at Amazon. They send 4 each time depending on how often you need them. I also subscribe to the regular Vaseline and so sometimes the deliveries overlap but I don't mind. I like choices."
4671,1,excellent_it smells so good! and it makes my hair so soft and curly and i can get through my hair so much easier than ever! and the best part no Silicone in it.
3663,1,great_This bronzer looks great on me. It gives you a really nice glow. I highly recommend it to anyone that wants a bronzer.
4429,1,"Great for mixing colors!_I initially bought these empty bottles to use with PVA, to make application easier as a basecoat when using glitter polishes. I've since found joy in mixing some of my unused polishes to create new, and grand color schemes. I'm thinking that they'll come in handy down the line when I get to the point of making my own indie polishes. At the price, they can't be beat. Definitely a must have for anyone interested in polish."
6004,1,Wife and daughter approved_My wife and daughter loves the smell of this product. Started out as a birthday gift for someone and turned into a must have for the wife and daughter.
2072,1,"Awesome!!! My daughter's Hair looks gorgeous!_My daughter has corkicelli or 3b curls.  Her hair looks gorgeous with the Curly Girl method and this stuff.  I also bought the Knot Today detangler.  This custard gel is all natural, it smells great, it has no harsh chemicals, and it looks amazing. It washes right off your hands when you are finished applying it, too.  We think it's worth every penny.  While we are 'Curly Girl Method' dropouts, we will use this gel forever.  It has some info we missed, when we were just reading on the internet about the CG method."
5869,1,"i love these!_These glitters were dirt cheap and they are gorgeous. Ive been using them to accent my eye shadows for holiday parties and a few times for fancy dinners. Ive also used them on my nails. They are tiny but they are only a few dollars and for the purpose of eyeshadow and nail accents, will last a good amount of time and there are 12 different colors to choose from."
2672,1,LOVE IT_I absolutely love this product!! i feel so safe using this in my 3.5 year old son's baths. I am breast feeding and I feel completely comfortable with using it in mine as well. The French Lavender smell is amazing!! I love this so much that I even gave a bottle to my aunt who is very serious about using products that does not have harmful chemicals in them. All of the main oils used in this are organic. LOVE IT!!
5540,1,NYX lip_I love these! Each color is different & unique. The pigmentation is amazing it lasts for hours & I find its best when coated with a lip gloss.
4913,1,"Leaves skin glowing_Really like the way this product makes my skin look and feel.  I use at night and wake up with a glow in the morning.  If I want to have that glow during the day, I'll opt to use it with my morning regimen.  (Always finish with SPF 30 or higher!)  I do believe my skin tone is improved and lines are less noticeable.  I'm on subscribe & save so I don't ever have to go without!"
4152,1,"Conditioner for Sensitive Skin_This was recommended to me by my child's dermatologist to treat her sensitive skin.  She has previously been breaking out due to the body wash and hair product we had been using with fragrance and dyes.  This conditioner has worked well to keep her skin healthy and her hair healthy.  The conditioner does a find job of making her hair smooth and taking out the tangles.  The only issue is that my daughter doesn't like the smell, but I don't really notice a distinct smell."
4237,1,"Healthy hair/ less scalp allergies_Pureology is a great product! I have tried this and the origional kind and like them both. I have sensitive skin and for years have had scalp, neck and upper back reactions from hair products. Iv'e tried other so called 'organic' products that became a total waste of money and my hair felt terrible. This is the ONLY product that gives me soft, shiny and healthy hair with no break outs! At all! In the past I used to get the store brand type products, they all caused a reaction. I never thought it would help to spend a lot more but sometimes you DO get what you pay for. I also not longer have frizzy hair, with out using any antifriz products. I guess the cheap stuff is just full of junk. This is my major splurge but it works!"
3936,1,"Reliable brand, practical uses_This polish is on the thicker side so it applies evenly and doesn't need too many coats. I use this as a base coat and for multiple color layering and it makes even the thinnest paints vibrant with just one coat. A must have if you do your own nails and want to step up your game."
4380,1,"Amazing!_I have had a lot of trouble with various brands of liquid liner somehow smearing a line onto the area above my eyelid while I'm at work. I got into the habit of constanty rubbing the area a few times an hour to remove the embarrising line. I had tried many different brands, waterproof also, and still the same thing happened or they were just a pain to put on and look decent. I love this eyeliner so much! It stays on all day, doesn't smear above my eyelid no matter how much I sweat, and the felt tip makes it so easy to put on and look good! It's cheap, available at drug stores, and comes off easy with some makeup remover."
5115,1,Best hair growth product ive ever used!!!!!!!!!!!!_I love this product because it actually made my hair grow long! I have long hair now but I stopped using it a couple years back and regretted. So now im back with mane n tail and intend to keep it that way. If you want your hair to grow this is the product for you. Unlike others I didnt experience the dry hair after using it but I guess not everything is for everyone. But its worth a try.
4666,1,"Great Moisturizer_This is a great moisturizer. I didn't expect the bottle to be big but it is. I had bought 2 and have been using one and its still full. The product itself is great. It's not oily at all, or sticky and does not feel heavy."
3461,1,"Great Primer_I love this primer and had to go to the hospital and had it on and it lasted for two days till my husband brought my makeup remover to me, I was very pleased and service was good from this company."
7522,1,Good versatile wig._We occasionally attend theme parties with friends and this wig is a good addition for my wife.  She is pleased with the fit/feel of this wig and recommends it.  It also doubles well for myself when we attend 80s throwback parties as it gives that 80s rockstar look to myself; with the right clothes too of course.
5721,0,It didnt work for me_This honestly did not work for me. I used the two bottles and still my eyelashes did not grow. wouldn't buy it again.
2525,1,"Brightened up my blonde hair_In combination with the conditioner, this has brightened up my blonde hair and I have even managed to survive a little longer between salon visits to touch up my highlights, because my natural mousy blonde roots have been brightened up as well. My hair is fine and fairly damaged from using my straightening iron, and this was a fairly nice shampoo that didn't cause any further dryness, despite me being a daily hair-washer. I will use again."
9907,1,"A great sponge_This really helps with sloughing off the dead skin off your face, yet it gentle. after 1 use I can see a differnce. I used it with and without cleanser and it works very nicely."
6540,1,Brights!_Now for the fun stuff... this palette has all your fun colors in one place to create bold and fun eye looks! Love these palettes from Shany!
2379,1,"Worked on my blackheads._I have the typical blackhead problem of the oily T-zone plus the blackhead trap on my chin. Granted, they're tiny, but if you don't keep after them, you get stretched pores and BIGGER blackheads.This device works nicely. It's a nice, small, palm-sized gadget, battery operated and easy to use. The pads are impregnated with salicylic acid, an excellent exfolliant that works fantastically well.The pads attach with velcro. Wet 'em and scrub away. The device works with that vibrating mode, similar to the Neutrogena device I have.I find it works best if you kind of 'stretch' the target area. Not so much with your fingers, but by facial movements. If I pull my bottom lip up to stretch out my chin, the device works great to clean the pores. Same thing with my nose in the whorls where blackheads seem to multiply.After several days, my skin looks pink and healthy, not at all dry, and my skin is somewhat sensitive. The blackheads aren't 'black' anymore, so it clearly works on that problem. I use a washcloth afterward, wrung out with very warm water, and it seems to take off the residue while cleaning up the rest of my face.The only caveat I'd issue is to be careful using this with any other product with salicylic acid. Overdo it, and you might get a bad case of the peels!I like it. If you have a huge blackhead problem, I'd just advise giving it a chance to work, and that means more than just a day or two."
7825,1,"Cute Make up Case_Came in about 3 weeks.  Love it, Its very cute & looks like its made well.  Very roomie in compartments.  Perfect makeup case for my teen daughter. I would def recommend"
669,1,"does the job_never bought this before but I wanted to make lotions bars and it did the job perfectly..nothing to compare it to since its the first time I used it, but its got to be the real deal the way it performs"
9689,1,"Kentucky Derby Winner!_Dove oxygen moisture conditioner is a winner. If I was going to race it against another product I would bet all my money on this one knowing it will win. This conditioner will run you all day, all night, and to your personal finish line."
2724,1,"Very good lotion!_I have really dry skin in a couple of spots and I've tried several different lotions over the years to try and get my skin hydrated and soft again.Thankfully, a little bit of the Vaseline Cocoa Radiant body lotion goes a long way. My skin is feeling softer and looking better than it has in a long time.I really love the fragrance, especially the jojoba oil.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this lotion. It is amazing!"
8032,1,"Works as advertised_Feedback from wife: She likes it very much. The serum works as advertised, and she is astonished and really happy with the results. She does feel that the price is the only factor stopping her from buying it soon. I reminded her that expensive SPA treatments also do cost a lot, and this serum she can use definitely more than once. One single visit to SPA is more than this. That did open up a vision in her mind :)."
1754,1,"Works for Me!_The Neutrogena Wave Power Cleanser is a wonderful product. Lightweight, doesn't take up much space, and cleans my face beautifully. I have very sensitive skin, so was wary the first time I used it. Afterward, my skin felt so soft, and I love the way the cleanser feels as it travels over my face, gently cleansing. No redness or irritation, which is a must for me. I recommend this product."
5924,1,Great buy_I love argan oil.  I use it on my hair and my cuticles and skin.  It is not at all greasy.
9925,1,"Love this Serum &#9829;_I use it at night, so that I can look beautiful and young in the morning. It is not sticky at all, smell nice and absorbed well on the skin. It moisturized and hydrates well, although I use a moisturizer after applying the serum. It's affordable and you can easily buy it from amazon. The packaging is also cute.If you are looking for Hyaluronic serum, you can give this a try. I am sure you'll love it."
4699,1,"Super Hydrating_The liquid goes on silky smooth.  It is extremely hydrating.  I use this in addition to another product, and I use it for it's hydrating effects as well as the peptides.  Of course the proof in a product is the results after long term use (8 weeks or longer).  I'll use this regularly thru the entire bottle then judge.  My immediate impression is NICE!"
6068,1,"Sigma Dare Palette_This palette has some pretty colors that blend very well, ones more pigmented than others which it was a surprise for me being this is a Sigma palette my expectations about pigmentation are higher specially since I also own the Limited Edition Paris palette and the pigmentation of each color is very good, nothing to complain about, well that is also the reason of the 4 stars only, was expecting more color pay off so definitively if you do get this palette that is very nice for summer, always use eye shadow primer. The shadow brush it comes with it is very good the Sigma brush quality, I already own a few and they do not disappoint."
1029,1,"Favorite Shampoo for Blonde Hair_This is my favorite shampoo for my blonde hair. It helps keeps out the brassiness that my hair is prone to, but is gentle enough to use multiple times in a week. I use this after I go in a chlorinated pool and it keeps the tone of my hair perfect. Definitely use with the conditioner for extra color-stay!"
678,1,"New favorite_This is my wife's new favorite. Its very pleasant, neither light nor heavy, just right. It lasts all day and then some. we gave three of these away as gifts to family members and everyone loved it. Highly recommended. This is a great value too as this perfume is 72$ in stores."
7427,1,"I am enjoying this one_I had fun testing this shampoo because of its fun and fruity, with a bit of floral scent. It is a very thick shampoo, so I just used a small amount on my short, but very thick hair. And I usrd it in conjunction with the matching conditioner.After using both, my hair was 'squeaky' clean, and had no heavy or greasy feel, it just felt clean. I also tested the shampoo on my skin, since it is aimed at the scalp, and was pleased with the way my skin felt afterwards.  Afterwards, I did a 'scent test' with my husband, and he found it pleasing.I am not a chemist, so I don't know about the Nutrium 10 claims, but I did enjoy using it and was pleased with the results."
9479,1,"Love this brush, and I'm picky_I'll start by saying that I like the Ecotools brand. I use their makeup brushes and have had them around 6 years and they still look brand new. So, that said, I was excited to see this brush. I had purchased a paddle brush with bamboo handle by a different company awhile ago and it was a lot more expensive. I needed to replace my old round brush, but didn't want to spend a lot of money. This brush also has the bamboo handle, with recycled plastic body. The barrel is large, but I like that in a round brush (I have chin length hair), I use a wide barrel to build volume. I didn't notice any snagging or tangling with this brush, but I have been styling with a round brush everyday for around 15 years and have short hair. I didn't notice it necessarily drying my hair faster than my old round brush, but the old one was vented too. The fact that the body of the brush is plastic and not metal, I'm hoping will  be less heat damaging. Over all I'm satisfied and are looking forward to more products from Ecotools being released."
479,1,Works great...._Bought this for our dog. It works really great. It makes our dogs coat much whiter and shinier. Plus it smells great. A little goes a long way. Our dogs skin doesn't get irritated. Great product.
8438,1,"A Decent Conditioner_This conditioner made my hair soft and manageable.  I've used a number of different products in this line, and I've found this conditioner to be comparable to the others.  I didn't think that this conditioner was necessarily any more frizz-controlling than the others (I've used the color care, the extra moisturizing, and the normal hair one).  It's a good conditioner, and one I'd definitely buy when in the market for a drugstore conditioner, just don't expect it to be a frizz-managing miracle-worker, because it is not.  Overall, good value and works well."
3310,1,"NYX Mega Shine Lip Gloss, Miami Babe_I've always been a fan of NYX, especially of their mega shine lip glosses. This color is amazing for any skin tone, its like a nude pink. I use it alone and to top nude lipsticks...amaaazing! By the way it smells nice."
5568,1,"Pretty nice brush_It combs through hair like a Mason Pearson BUT I do not like the rubbery soft plastic handle.  Is it soft plastic or rubber?  Not sure if it's going to tun into sticky mess in a few years.  But for the price, it really does comb through my head of fine, but tons of wavy, curly nearly waist length hair."
2542,0,"Meh - Changed my mind_EDIT: I've now used this for several months & decided I don't like it. It delivers too much product at 1 time, so you have a blob of these fibers in a half dollar size area. So, now, I just tap the product against my head, out of the container.If they could somehow figure out a spray applicator with fine control of the part you press (so a lot doesn't come out at once), that would probably work.-------------------------------I think it helps apply the product easier (& you use less of it), then just gently move the product thru your hair with your fingertips."
8974,1,"works great! creates soft wavy hair_This waver stands out against the rest by utilizing the reversable wave form. You can pull it off and flip it depending on whether you want deep or shallow waves. pretty cool feature that gives you a choice, rather than having to buy two different wavers. Heats up very fast and i was able to do all my hair in about 10 minutes(i have really long, straight hair, and LOTs of it) Not too bad in terms of how long it takes. I personally felt that the deeper waves made me look like i had an 80's perm, but that just might be because i had no idea what style i was going for. i was just making waves! The shallower waves are better for everyday, to wear your hair down."
6457,1,Yummy scrub!_This scrub is perfect!! I was so impressed when I first tried it. I use it every day and even on my face sometimes. This is great for gifts or girls night in for pedicures. Love the smell! No complaints :-)
1417,0,"Allergic to beeswax_I was looking for a product with no petrolatum.  Have been using Vaseline on my lips for many years and went organic.  Trying to avoid vaseline, I came across this un-petrolatum product.  However, after using it for about 1 day, my lips started to burn and my lips got swollen.  It looked very good, very Angelina Jolie, but that was NOT the look I was going for.  Kept using it and using it until after one week, my lips just constantly burned and chapped and turned red and blistered a bit with some yellow white dots.  Did some research on line and I am allergic to beeswax.  YIKES!  Stopped using the product and went to an organic beeswax free lip balm (Bee Friendly Natural SPF 15 organic lip balm...NOT sold on Amazon and picked it up at Whole Foods Market) and boom, my issue disappeared.  Whoever thought that I would be allergic to beeswax.  That was strange.  Anyway, for those of you NOT allergic to beeswax, this product would be great...but unfortunatley, for those of us allergic to beeswax, this product won't work.  Sorry."
3337,1,"Great Shampoo_Great Shampoo.  This is a very nice shampoo for several reasons:  It's sulfate-free, so it's gentle on your hair.You don't have to use alot of the product to get excellent results.  It leaves my gray/silver hair soft with a beautiful shine.  I also use the Pravana Pure Light Brightening Conditioner and am very pleased with both products."
4333,1,"Best hairspray_I have tried everything!This one is smooth,light and hair looks fabulous!I had John Fried before and it was sticky,smelly and made my scalp dry!Now i found best hairspray for me!"
5990,1,"Best I ever tried, bar none!!!_I am not using any other moisturizers ever again!  I do keep an aveno basic around for the body.Ok, so this is fantastic because it promotes cell turnover.  That means my skin is now rejuvenating itself at a faster rate.  I use to suffer from mild eczema, and this causes a small breakout to disappear in 24 hours!  My boyfriend even commented to me that I don't get my dry patches (eczema ) anymore.  I told him I found this cream and how great it works,.  I found this cream because my roommate works at Whole Foods and got a free sample.Also my skin looks like a 20 year olds and glows! It is soft too.  (I'm 42)I even got a bad cold and you know when you get dry skin under the nose...?  Well used this and gone by next day.I'm using this daily and have the night cream too, but this and the night cream seem equally effective.  I use to buy very very expensive creams but this is all I now ever need.  I do use this daily, for if I don't, my skin will go back to being dry and such.Don't stop making this product!!!!!  I looove it so much..."
3454,1,"LOVE_I love Himalaya and really love this face wash! at first the scent wasn't all too pleasant to me, but you get use to it.My skin is clearer while using this product and not as oily during the day. Keeps my skin soft and clean without over drying"
2847,1,Great!_This lotion is so good. It's perfect for ethnic women like me. This lotion kept my skin moisturizes until all day and all night.
3573,1,"Beautiful._I've only been using the dove white moisture bar, I've tried the cucumber also but wanted to try this and I absolutely Love the fragrance. It's very soft and makes me feel refreshed. I love the way it feels on my skin and I definitely recommend."
9283,1,WEN Rocks_I love WEN Intensive Oil. It really gives my hair shine and I also put a few drops into my skin.  Great smell too.  It is a very good product. &#128077;&#128077;&#128077;
3828,1,Great value_I love these blushes they are so beautiful. The colors are fantastic. They last a long time. I recommend to start with a little bit of blush and build it up because these are so pigmented that if you use a heavy hand you will end up looking like a clown. I recommend these if you're looking for great makeup and colors for a low price.
2416,1,"Great for makeup removal and a fresh face._This is a great basic cleaner.  I use it in the morning and at night.  It takes off pretty much all of my makeup, but I also use baby oil to get mascara/eye liner off."
9036,1,works quite well_I use it just about every single day. Works well but my hair is dried out after using it. I will order something better in the future.
9895,1,"Awesome Stuff!!_First, the scent. I can't quite put my finger on the perfume that it reminds me of, but it smells so good!! I want it bottled to wear everyday! Dead Sea Mud Shampoo is not just a pretty scent, but the shampoo is fabulous!The shampoo doesn't feel grainy or like mud, it is however brown until you start massaging it into your hair and scalp then turns white. I definitely get plenty of rich soft suds. My hair has TONS of BODY and SHINE since I've started using Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo.I have very thin, lifeless, color treated hair. Dead Sea Mud Shampoo doesn't stain my blonde highlights. It doesn't change the color of my hair in the least. My hair is soft! FULL and my scalp is totally and completely itch and flake free. My hair feels awesome!!If you have dry scalp like I do, this is one great shampoo to try!! The shampoo contains Chamomile, and Olive Oil, which keeps your hair from drying out, as it keeps natural moisture in scalp. I felt a difference from the first shampoo!LOVE!!!"
3572,1,Perfect Solution for facial sensitivity_I would highly recommend to people with sensitive faces when trying various facial skin creams for moisture and protection against dryness.
767,1,"All Time Favorite_This is my all time favorite body wash because of its intensely rich lather and fresh pleasing scent. I first discovered it several years ago on a visit to my in-laws. They were in their 70s at the time and recommended this product to me because they said it had really made a difference with their dry skin. I loved the scent when I first opened the bottle. It's very fresh, clean, and pleasant smelling without smelling 'chemical-ish' or flowery at all. The lather is so rich and creamy that I can't compare it to that of any other body wash I've ever tried, and I've tried a lot of them. Every member of my family likes this stuff, from my in-laws to my husband to my kids. I would recommend this to anyone who would like a creamy body wash that makes a lot of lather and has a pleasant scent that men or women will like. I also think it's especially good for kids and older adults who have issues with dry skin."
8783,1,"Awesome product_I love this mask. It's easy to apply, nor pretty to see for your significant other, but our skin is significantly smoother and more elastic after keeping it on for 30 minutes. It also cools down any feeling of irritation (I have a very sensitive skin). I felt 10 years young after removing the mask, the wrinkles were noticeably reduced."
6484,1,"Great_I use this with the simple smoothing facial scrub, and it has done wonders for my face."
3372,1,Love this product_My husband must wash his hair every day and this is perfect- does not dry out his hair and looks great.
1333,1,"worth the money_I have gradually come to terms with the fact that my hair is curly. After spending years blowing out my hair and straightening it only to have it poof up with a hint of moisture in the air I decided to give up and embrace the curl. I'll admit I did not know how to care for curly hair and started doing some research. On a recommendation I looked into deva curl. After trying pain co washing for a few weeks I finally splurged on the deva curl. I have never bought into the hype that the more expensive the product is the better it is but in this case there is no comparison between normal drug store brands and Deva Curl. My curls are more defined and almost completely frizz free, which I never thought possible. I am currently using the no poo, one condition and either the ultra or light defining gel. While the products themselves make a major difference knowing how to use them properly produces even better results. I was using them for a few weeks with decent results but after watching some videos about how to use the three step and having it explained in person as a hair model at the Deva Curl academy my hair looks great. Not only are the before and after pictures on the web legit they are easily repeatable at home. While I can't say this is the best curl product out there it does work and I would suggest anyone unhappy with their curly hair to give it a try or look into other curl friendly products. I've seen some complaints about the smell of the product. It does have silght chemical, I'm in a salon type smell I actually liked it. You may want to try with a smaller size or go with the deva care line if you think this may be an issue for you."
3171,1,"Always great_Always a great product! Goes on with NO clumps, makes eyelashes long and full. Not to mention, it smells like roses...literally!"
9670,1,"Best Vitamin C Serum if you want to see results!_I was very impressed with Poppy Austin's Vitamin C Serum.  First of all this serum has all beneficial properties to fight the aging process such as sagging, wrinkles, uneven skin tone.  It contains all the nourishment skin needs, like Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Aloe, and Jojoba Oil. All Organic, too!  The Serum is instantly absorbed into the skin and I instantly felt softness.  After a week of using Poppy Austin I noticed my face was brighter as it evened out my skin tone giving me healthy glowing skin!  It does help tremendously with those sneaky fine wrinkles by softening them.  After another week of use my face looks firm and not saggy. It's very rare to find a anti-aging product that actually works as stated.  Another thing I liked very much is that the bottle is 2 oz versus the norm 1 oz. size which is great for the pocket book."
2056,1,"Great Stuff!_I got them especially for the acne on my back. I use it with a back scrubber and its been everything I hoped for. The first week I ended up with more acne than usual but thats the cleanser working, getting everything out. I used it every day for the first 2 weeks and now I use it every other day since it dried my skin out some."
4595,1,"Great mascara_Not the dramatic look that you can get with some mascaras but a great natural mascara. If you layer it, you will get a more intense look. I love that it doesn't flake and is easy to remove. I don't find it on my pillow case in the morning like I have with some other mascaras."
290,1,"A gentle way to tone the skin_I use this product after I have cleansed my face. The top of the product allows you to control the amount of toner on the cotton ball or cotton pad.  This product does not irritate my skin and always leaves my skin mineral makeup free.  This product is alcohol-free, paraben-free, and propylene glycol-free.Made in the USA"
1338,1,"Good little bottle_I've been using this for just a little while, but it's been working great. It's a nice size and is easy to travel with. I haven't had any issues with leaking. I'd recommend it."
8798,1,Hardly Fades_These are the most helpful little stud when wanted to make your nails look simple but fashionable. I wore them for a whole two weeks and only little of the color faded. I recommend (:
1443,1,"Good results, annoying smell_It was easy to apply and stayed on well. My only complaint is the smell. It smells exactly like sunscreen, whish is not that attractive in my opinion. Now that I think about it, extra must be applied to the reddest areas. If too mush is applied to white areas, the skin turns green. it took practice, but eventually it helped. I also liked that there was no real perfum added, so it is good for my sensitive skin."
7733,1,"Defines Curls_I really like the way it smells and that it's not sticky like other gels when I apply it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because when I flip my hair over and scrunch my hair and then try to dry it, it gets really matted after. Either it has a bad reaction to my hair or my hair isn't curly enough yet to get te results the curly girl method suggests. However, it does work if I just apply to my hair without flipping it over and scrunching. It does define my curls and gives my hair life all day."
4212,1,"Make skin feel great_I found these at Marshall's and I'm so glad I did. I was going on a retreat for a few days and didn't want to take my entire bottle of facial cleanser so I bought these instead! They are convenient, perfect for travel and everyday use. They made my skin feel pretty good and didn't cause breakouts or dryness. I used to use the Pond's ones which I liked but these work just as well plus they are natural! I don't wear a lot of make-up so whether or not they remove make-up well wasn't an issue for me."
1772,1,"Great stuff._Lasts longer than most such foundations, and it's easy to put it on without making it cakey. No shine, no odor. Covers well."
1982,1,"Great polish for stamping!_I had been using regular polish for stamping, but after hearing raves about this polish being much better for stamping, I have to agree. It's a lot more opaque, and seems to take a tad longer to dry, which gives you a few more seconds when transferring the image to your nail. As for the reviews that say it smells really bad, I honestly didn't notice. It smells like regular polish to me."
1640,1,"I love it! Love it! Love it!_My favorite hair oil. I use it for about a year now. I absolutely happy with the results. My hair is permed and with this oil its hydrated and stays in soft curls, looking naturally and easy to stile."
7015,0,"Caked on my eyelid_I think this is a young person's eye shadow. I'm 67 and have really good skin, but this shadow caked on my eyelid. If you're between 15 and 40, it will probably work great for you. Just make sure your skin is taunt or you'll probably run into the same problem I did."
3837,1,Good quality_Matches my hair color and applies very well.  Price is right and would buy again.  Good value for the money.
3710,1,"Hello Gorgeous!_Several years ago my straight hair developed some frizziness in weird places. Since then, I've been looking for something to reliably tame those frizzies and I think I've found it in Kerastase Reflection Chroma Thermique Thermo Radiance Protecting Milk (try saying that quickly five times.&#8220;Milk&#8221; is a bit of a misnomer. This is a thick, white cream. It's very luxurious. It does have a strong floral fragrance when applied, but that dissipates. I used it this morning and 12 hours later, I don't smell it in my hair.My hair has added shine since I started using the protecting milk and my frizzies are gone! Have I said I love this product? My worst hair problem has been resolved.  My hair feels soft and silky, yes.I've already collected an arsenal of products to keep my color from fading. I'm hesitant to give them up to see if the Protecting Milk alone can keep my color full of life. But I do love the idea of having UV protection in my hair.I really love this product. It smells great and it works to keep my hair shiny and smooth."
3831,1,"My new favorite Argan oil hair treatment_I am a lover of Moracconoil Argon Oil hair treatment and have added this product to my regimen to save some money.  I use both, alternating days.  The Agadir product has a nice fragrance and I love the spray format.  I can control just how much I put on my hair.  The first hair appointment I had after using this product, my stylist asked me if I changed anything because my hair was SUPER soft and in great condition.  I told her about Agadir and thank Tammy at uppiesbeads59 on You Tube channel for recommending this to me."
6150,1,"Somewhat surprising_So I must admit I am a bit of a mascara snob. Typically I prefer Givency or MAC, however on a lark I thought I would try a less expensive brand. After a few uses I was actually rather pleased. Their short and long fibres do work well together and the product did give me some nice length. My only caution to those that aren't aware, the models for most all mascaras have false lashes or have been photo enhanced so do not expect to recreate their precise look. (in Europe manufacturers are required to disclose this). That being said, for less than $10.00 I think it was a good buy."
4048,1,"great for the Price_i bought this on a whim and it turned out i really liked it. the colors are great and they give me a range of looks To do. truely Work better than many of it's more expensive counterparts. only complaints= its kinda hard To open With nails and after one slip into my sink from my hand and i had a very dusty sink.which is why i nbought more, two Colors this time. i don't fully mind the break:,it was My fault and it's so cheap it's not a big deal."
1317,1,effective brush on transiting hair_husband and I use this brush .its soft and easy on the hair strands and scalp. does not pull my hair out like the harder Denman classic brush. great for thin to med hair textures too.
29,1,"The best moisturizer_I cannot believe how great this moisturizer is, especially for the price. It is such an excellent deal! I use this every night after I wash my face, and my skin looks fantastic (if i do say so...) I don't have any breakouts, which i used to have occasionally, and my skin is so smooth. I've recommended this to so many of my friends and family members, and they all love it too."
7917,1,The best_What can I say about nail gems - the best.  But these are coloured which adds to the the fun.  I highly recommend them!
3805,1,great stuff_moroccan oil works wonders for my hair - always smooth and shiny after i put just a dab in. this stuff is great!
3946,1,"Be a man_My husband loves this product in both scents. The smell is manly but not Axe-diculous so I'm no longer compelled to buy separate soap for myself. The soap is moisturizing but not weak like other bar soaps on the market, and not harsh like Dial."
7923,1,"Great Sunscreen, Steep Price_I've tried to use the more natural zinc oxide sunscreens on my children before, and they complain because they smell, and it makes them white, and I have to rub it in so much...  Not so with this sunscreen.  It goes on smooth and easy, it's not too greasy, and the smell is fine.  It also seems to work well providing sun protection.I appreciate that it doesn't have PABA and phthalates, but there is still a long list of ingredients that I'm not familiar with.  (I guess that's what makes it go on so easily!)I've tried another Cotz sunscreen before and was really happy with it, and I'm just as pleased with the pediatric one.  My main hesitation is the price.  $18.64 for 3.5 oz seems pretty steep.  And with three kids, we'll be out of this in no time!"
3233,1,"cute_I had never seen a dual lip gloss. I gave it to my sister has a thank you gift, She thought it was moisturizing and cool looking"
5646,1,Nail Decor_I loved that I received this item before the time frame and it came well packaged. I have been wanting this kind of tools to help me in my pursue of my nail art hobby and it is just perfect because it has different sizes and they work as I imagined.
4008,1,Good body spray._Smells great doesn't stain. I spray this before hitting the gym & when I don't want to wear a deodorant due to the ingredients found in most deodorants.
7268,1,"love it_paid $17 for this here on amazon. I was a little hesitant since some reviews said it didnt work, but i really like it. so far its worked fine for me. no miracle, but i like to apply at night before i go to bed. This will be my go-to eye cream from now on. the price is great and you get a lot for your $. the jar is bigger than most eye creams. Cream is thick and a little goes a long way. Before i was using either Avon, Garnier, or oil of olay, and for the price this is the best. and in a larger quantity."
5141,0,"Wish I had read the other reviews first ;-(_I thought this was a moisturizer and dark circle treatment product.  When I bought it at the store, that is what the package advertising made it sound like.It's actually a bad concealer.  I bought it before I read all the reviews....silly me!  It won't happen again."
5761,1,"Great Brushes_These brushes are great, I own several Real Techniques brushes, this set was the latest addition to my collection and did not disappoint. They are soft, great for blending shadows and applying eyeliner, super easy to wash and dry really fast. I have not had any problems with the hairs falling out at all. I love the brushes, but the case they come in isn't very practical for traveling (its a little bulky just to store those little brushes)."
9330,1,fresh citrusy scent_Smells great and lathersrinses well.  I just returned from 2 weeks at the beach and washed my hair with this - beautiful!  I've used this brand before and loved the results.  Gave my hair lots of bounce and little build up.  Used it along with the matching conditioner and have gotten a lot of compliments on how my hair looks and smells.
9888,1,"Great even on thick hair!_My daughter has an abundance of long, very thick hair and this works wonders.  It takes tangles out without tugging or pulling and she can use it on wet hair or dry.  My younger daughter with thick, shorter hair also loves the fact that she can now brush her hair without it hurting her sensitive scalp and I enjoy the peace and quiet that comes with this brush since I no longer have to hear, &#34;OUCH, Mommy!  You're hurting my head!&#34;  I have used this brush also and find it even a nice scalp massage while brushing my hair."
49,1,Love Pond's_The product has been around for years and has proven itself to be an excellent makeup remover.  I will continue to purchase it.  Amazon has very good prices and is prompt.
6434,1,"Clearasil Perfectawash_A review from my wife:I love the fact that this product is hands free!! I love being able to put my hand under it and have a good amount of face wash placed in my hand.  I tend to overuse my face wash, leaving me buying more than I really need.  This stops me from doing that!The sensor on the dispenser is fairly sensitive so it will go off even when you don't put your hand underneath it.  This can be avoided by turning the dispenser off and turning it back on when you want to use it.  This is slightly inconvenient though because you have to wait for the blinking lights to stop blinking before it is ready to be used.  This is just a little annoyance compared to how it dispenses the perfect amount of face wash and saves me money considering I'm not wasting any face wash.As for the actual face wash that comes with the dispenser, I was not completely impressed with it.  I have sensitive skin and it was gentle enough to use on my sensitive skin, which was nice.  However, it did nothing to help my acne.  Granted, I used it once a day for a couple months and didn't see any differences.  Perhaps if I used it in the morning and at night and for an extended period of time, my results regarding my acne would be different.  I'm just hesitant to stray away from my current face wash as it has been working quite well for me.  For the price and the awesomeness of the dispenser, I'd consider it a good buy."
3230,0,"Broken after using only 5 times_After getting the product, I used it about 5 times and just let it sit for about 4 months because it seemed to irritate my skin. Recently I thought I'd try using it again but it was out of juice so started to charge it when it started emitting this high pitched whine. I pressed the button to try to shut it off but not responsive. this one goes to the landfill..."
5523,1,"I LOVE THIS STUFF_My husband and I are both big fans of this product. We have used it for a long time. It is wonderful for exfoliating the face. I also use it on my knees, elbows and heels when they need it. It is gentle and leaves skin soft and smooth!"
7364,1,Great green!_I was looking for a green polish because I don't have any in my growing polish collection.  I picked mojito madness because the color looked bright without being neon green. I love the color on my toes and the application was effortless.
5027,1,"Great for the price!_Let me start by saying I have never tried the more expensive clairsonic or nutrisonic devices.  But I love this little brush.  My skin feels great after I use it, and it lets me use less moisturizer at a time.I wish they made a body-brush head for this device.  The only body brushes that are reviewed are either quite expensive, Clairsonic or woefully unreliable Nutrisonic--too bad.  I'll let you know how the clairsonic body brush does--as soon as I save up the money to get it (smiles)."
2553,1,"Love it_Smells and feels great, I no longer have to purchase from so called &#34;kitchen cosmetic&#34; businesses for this stuff which charge way more."
9424,1,"Received notices instantly!_My mother is a hairdresser so I am usually always getting some kind of highlight or color style. I decided to try this since I was due in a few weeks for a touch up. I put a few quarter sized squirts in my hand and while I didn't have time to stay for the complete 15 mins each layer, I did notice the shine to my hair almost instantly. This is more of a gloss to bring out the color that was done to your hair. If you didn't have color done, then you will probably see no change except for maybe shinier hair. Since I have so many copper tones naturally this product really brought out a healthy glow to my hair and I couldn't be more pleased!"
5059,1,"It's growing on me..._UPDATE: I now have renewed faith in this product after trying another one that didn't work at all for me. I had been using Cantu for my roller sets and the results were always fairly decent, but nothing to rave about. I decided to graduate to a curl-specific product (Shea Moisture's Curl Enhancing Smoothie) and my hair didn't like that product at all. From now on, it's Cantu leave-in conditioner for me and my curls!I first bought this product around May 2011. I started transitioning to natural and this seemed to be the most mentioned leave-in conditioner on all the natural hair blogs.I don't love this product, but I don't hate it either. It's difficult to judge because while I have about 4 inches of new growth, the product reacts a little differently on my relaxed ends (still have 5 inches of relaxed hair).My new growth doesn't feel as soft as I'd like it to once my hair dries. I was expected a very soft feel, but that's not what I get when using this product.The one thing I do REALLY like is that it's a superb detangler. It's not labeled as a detangler, but my comb glides easily through my wet hair when I apply this product.Another thing I really like is that when I use it to set my hair with rods/rollers, my curls come out super soft and bouncy - not hard and crunchy like gels and setting lotions.Will I buy it again? Maybe. Like I said, I LOVE that it detangles my hair so easily. But I would like to try other products now so that I can compare."
8653,1,Love and Easy to Clean up your Nails_I like using these pens because clean up of your nail polish is so much easier and exact that your nails look very professional.  You get a lot of pens and extra tips to change out but one tip will last a long time even though color is on it it wont bleed into the next polih change.  I love these.
4140,1,Affordable Luxury_Absolutly love this brush. It is the softest brush in my collection. Not too expensive but feels like a million bucks. Picks up mineral makeup well and delivers good coverage. I highly recomend it.
9059,1,"Great Stamper_works amazingly. Great for images you have to line up, and it was a lot easier to prevent smudging. When I first used the large scraper it didn't work which I was afraid of because of another review BUT I flipped it to the other side and tried again scraped off perfectly. Very deserving of 5 stars."
9080,1,Perfect_I bought this on a whim because I needed some stiff brushes for cream n liquid makeup. This is absolutely perfect.
6304,1,"Packaged wonderfully but...._I love these gems, and the price is right, but I lost a few of the gems because they spilled out during shipment. These were packaged well, i'm sure there was nothing more they could do to stop the spillage, since the were wrapped tightly and they still spilled out..."
9035,1,"Good Product - With LED light_Other reviewers have said it all.It heats up quickly.The LED is easy-to-read.It does what it's supposed to do: straightens hair without my having to  make a million passes.  Additionally,  I can twist up, under, or around for soft curl.I control the temperature, so unless it's my own fault, I shouldn't be in danger of bursting into flame.The only drawback: my bathroom being small and having only one outlet, because of the iron's large 3-prong plug with its standard red and yellow trip fuses, I have to unplug it at some time every day. Why? The iron and my hairdryer, which also has  trip fuses, cannot be plugged in at the same time.  For this reason, my heat settings must be re-done each morning , and I cannot set the iron's automatic shut-off.  This is not a deal-breaker.Odd thing:  It comes with a single glove, designed to prevent a person from getting burned, but since it's large enough to fit my husband's hand, the fingertips flop around on me.  Most likely I'd make some awkward move and end up dropping the iron on my foot.The leave-in oil sample is nice.  After I finish up my other hair products, leave in conditioner by Abba (which I've always loved) and a nice spray shine by Loma, I may switch."
6763,1,Awesome_This product is very nice and has a nice affect on my nails and I really enjoy them. I would recommend it to others.
8879,1,"Love this - perfect for Ravens fans_Great color, and of course, the OPI quality is awesome. The purple is a good match for anyone looking to create designs or show their team spirit for the Baltimore Ravens. I use it with the black shatter and it's amazing."
584,0,"aveda_If you have allergies, stay away from anything aveda or your skin will break out big time! All of their products cause breakouts for sensitive skin!"
7088,1,"relly works!_This &#34;drug&#34; works, I'm picky and expect a lot. It works, really. I see that my face is smoother! Highly Recommend a salesmen!"
7195,1,Gorgeous colour..._not so gorgeous formula. I tried wearing this several times before it dawned on me why I was having trouble. My bottle was too thick. I added 4 drops of polish thinner and now it's absolutely perfect!I love this colour. I ended up doing the same thing to 'Roll in the Hague' and ' Kiss Me on my Tulips.' Great fix for all three which makes sense since they are all part of the same collection.
7932,1,great for travel and a hat stand_love how you can fold this up for travel and this is pretty strudy as long as no one keeps touching it great for displaying not for you brush you wig great for a hat stand
2728,1,"Back to the Future - Cheaper than the Microdermabrasion systems!_A friend recommended the microdermabrasion system on an infomercial. Seriously was going to buy it and I remembered, hey wonder if Buf Pufs still exist and of course (used them 20-30 years ago, checked on Amazon and voila!  Great reviews and now more choices. Been using for the last 3 days with my Loreal Cream face wash. Oh my goodness, my skin texture is so smooth AND the pores are finer in just 3 days.  Very very very happy with this, again!"
8855,0,"You live and you learn_I actually purchased this brand by accident. I thought I was buying the one made by Bliss. I don't know how I made this error. When it got here I was reluctant to use it but what was done, was done. I thought I might as well try to see if it was any good.Big mistake. This thing is hard. It doesn't give at all like the ones made by Bliss or other companies. Typically, these types of mitts are made of a soft rubber that glide over you easily. However, this one felt like it was made out of petrified wood. It hurt so bad that I gave up my experiment. I want to massage my body not bruise and torture myself."
6283,1,Great cleaner!_I'm on my second container and love these discs!  They have a mild scrubbing side and a smooth cleansing side.  And you cannot beat the price on Amazon.
1201,1,"I like_This is a great product but the reason it doesn't get 5 stars is I feel I must use more than usual to spread on my skin. The bottle won't last long. I wonder if this comes in bigger sizes. I have very, very dry skin that is eczema prone & responds well to natural products. This product does a wonderful job moisturizing my skin and maintaining that moisture, plus I love the smell."
1499,1,"Depends on ur taste in curls._I like this item very much. I accidentally bought this item instead of the thicker curling iron so I ended up purchasing that too. I still use this to touch up my curls. Te quality is great, nonetheless."
2620,1,"Beats out any blow dryer I've ever used!_Don't you just love the blow dryers that make your hair frizzy, burn and blow it off to never-never land? Neither do I! So I had stopped using them. I came across the Tresemme hairdryer that insisted it would make my hair shinier and frizz-free. It also boasted that, while it would blow dry my hair very quickly, it wouldn't have heat-spots. With a 45 day money back guarantee, and a 2 year full warranty, I decided to give this dryer a shot. I'm so thrilled I did. While the size scared me a little (I have issues with weak wrists/hands), it's actually very light and easy to manage. I have very long hair. It took me all of five minutes to dry it - I kid you not. I love the nozzle design on this dryer,too. It disperses the heat, so I don't end up with the smell of burnt hair permeating the room. I was impressed with the high flow of air on the fast setting. Usually, I can't hear anyone around me when I'm blow drying my hair. However, this wonderful hair dryer is much more quiet than any others I've used. The low speed is perfect for setting my hair. It's a gentle breeze! My hair most definitely didn't frizz (a first) and while I didn't notice my hair was any shinier than normal, it did feel lighter. I was very impressed as I really put the dryer to the challenge with using it in a very steamy hot/humid bathroom - just after stepping out of the shower. I still can't believe it dried my hair so fast. I'm also thrilled that I didn't burn my hair, even with the dryer on the highest setting - right next to my scalp (to give it body). I'll update if there are any issues later. For now, I say this is definitely a great buy! You can't beat the 45 day money back guarantee or the full 2 year warranty. I'm happy to see a company standing firmly behind their product. I hope you are as pleased as I am with your purchase! ENJOY!"
693,0,"this was meant to be a gift for me off of my wishlist_I have ordered this perfume many times and bought it from the department store , only TODAY did I realize that I this perfume was ordered for me and never arrived ! disappointed I don't know who sent it to me so I cant contact them to tell them I never got a bottle -"
5521,1,"My favorite wash at any price_Did you know that you can prevent all soap scum in your shower or tub by not using--wait for it--soap?  Use a body wash instead! I love the creamy feel of this particular body wash. It lathers very well, and it doesn't have a perfume-y sent.  I've tried many other brands, most quite a bit more expensive, but this is my favorite.  No other brands gives me such a nice, rich creamy lather.  It also works great as a bubble bath in the tub.  I love it when the best product also has the best price!I don't know why, but this is hard to find in stores.  Target is about the only place I can find it, but shipped to my door via subscribe and save is even better!"
1924,1,"Good Conditioner for Thick Hair_Motions At home Moisture Plus Conditioner works great on my thick Asian hair.  I only need a small amount to get my hair conditioned, and after blow drying, my hair feels soft and is manageable.  I use this in conjunction with their leave in conditioners/oils to get super soft hair.  Highly recommended."
9695,0,"Doesn't hydrate_Previously before I started using this, I was using the Clear Frizz control and it wasn't helping with frizz and it was actually drying out my scalp. So, I decided I would give this one a try since it is scalp and hair intense hydration...well after two weeks of using this,with the shampoo, it has not hydrated my scalp one bit! It is still dry. I have never had this problem with any other brands.This one does moisture my hair more than the frizz control one and I do have less frizz than I had with the frizz control. But that is it. The smell is barely noticeable so that is an okay thing about this product, but overall, this conditioner doesn't do what it says it is going to do."
1451,1,"I bought mine at Macy's to avoid fraud...Anyway, this smells amazing!_It's so expensive at $80.00 + tax for the 1.0z bottle (I hope I never run out of this stuff because it's the most expensive perfume I've ever bought) but it smells amazing! And while I probably could've found it a bit cheaper online I didn't wanna risk getting a fake or stale product and not being able to return it. I always trust the department stores for high end products. Anyway, I am so in love with this fragrance! Viktor & Rolf's 'Flowerbomb', Katy Perry's 'Killer Queen', Juicy Couture's 'Viva La Juicy' and Beyonce's 'Pulse' are my signature fragrances!"
6883,1,It finally came!!!_well I choose this rateing because I haven't used this yet so I'm not sure if there is anything wring with this product. I guess I would get another if I need it again.
961,1,"Oh Boy Is It Pink!!!_This is the second of the two colors that I am dying my hair. I also used the Purple Haze, and I have to tell you that this is amazing! Following the directions of many that I came across, I did not follow the directions on the package in regards to time. I am dyeing weave and I bleached the weave from a dark/auburn blond to an almost platinum blond and then applied the dye and left it on for 1 1/2 hours. I rinsed it off and I was so surprised at how seriously pink it was. It is absolutely fabulous! I have used Splat! blue dye in the past and it turned out way, way too dark and for that matter the dye continued to drip after the hair was rinsed because the dye would never run off the hair. I was so disappointed because the only one that figured out my hair was blue was my supervisor and even he said that it was not noticeable until I stepped into the light. I bleached that hair to light blond and it came out too dark. But this product does everything it claims. If people are not getting the right result then leave it in your hair longer than 30 minutes. I know people say that the dye should not dry in your hair but I allowed the dye to start drying in the hair and then rinsed with warm water, then used Herbal Essence shampoo and that got the rest of the dye out. I am so stoked about this product and I have been converted! Buy this, you will not be mad. Just leave it in longer and you will have the hot pink color!"
560,1,"Inis, the best fragrance ever!_First purchased this in Ireland many years ago.  I've received so many compliments when wearing Inis -- it's crisp, fresh, and never overwhelming. Iordered a refill through Amazon from Celtic Croft yesterday and received it today!!! I'm almost as impressed with their service as I am with this delightful fragrance!"
5633,1,ooooh...sparkly_Nice in a very thin coat to spruce/sparkle up a french mani or over other colors to jazz them up. Pretty just plain over clear base coat. Fun!
8185,1,"Marked Improvement in Two Weeks, so . . ._Imagine what my skin will look like in eight weeks!Aging skin is no joke.  Thinning, wrinkling, in general this is skin no one wants to see.  So, I&#8217;ll be ordering more of this &#8216;Skinny Cream&#8217; when the tube is empty, because, after two weeks use, I&#8217;m see great results.  My skin is becoming firmer and thicker and moving back to its previous condition.How does it work?  I do not know.  I only know it does.  Give it a try.  You might be as pleased as I am.FIVE STARS!"
7440,1,"..._Easy to hold bottle and a pleasing scent. It rinsed cleanly and when paired with the shampoo, it left my hair feeling very soft and clean."
6366,1,"They do what they should_These cuticle pushers do what they should, they aren't any better or worse than any of the others I've used. The price was good and the product works, what more could you ask for?"
1929,1,"Light Hold, Moisturizing Shine_This Shine Enhancing Pomade does exactly what is says it does, very well. It delivers a moisturizing shine with a light hold but the light scent is not pleasant to me and it lingers."
1538,1,"Love it!_I love Out the Door Northern Lights topcoat! Along with an effective protective topcoat the shine is amazing! This was the first time Ive bought the gold, in the past Ive bought the silver but this color is amazing! Highly recommended!"
1292,1,"Updated review: Good Product_This is what I put in my first review, which at the time I gave only 3 stars: 'I used this product for the first time today. It does a good job of holding hair in place but I had a respiratory reaction to it that will keep me from using it again. (I have asthma and it caused constriction in my bronchial tubes.)'Now I've raised the stars to five because I gave the product another chance and it didn't affect my asthma. I then used it a third time to make sure it was still okay before updating my review. It was, so I feel I can recommend the product without reservation. I don't know why I had that initial bad experience, but it might have been that the first dab had more of some ingredient in it. This is a product I will be reordering and using with confidence."
244,1,"Cricket Static Free Brush Rpm, 8 Row_great for short hair,does not get static electricity,was was a little higher price then i wanted to pay but was worth it."
2823,1,"feels great_This lotion makes my skin feel great. I do look a bit shiny after applying and I am not sure how to fix that, but it makes my skin feel soft and supple. I like it. I just don't care for the shine."
9916,1,Wow_my wife is really happy with this product - she's used it on her thighs using a recipe that Natural Escentials was nice enough to send her and she says how they are now so soft and smooth with a nice glow to them - she loves that its 100% natural - she can't wait to try the mask that was mentioned in the other reviews...highly recommended!
9340,1,Good Mirror_I was looking for a nice standing mirror for my makeup application and for the price this is phenomenal! The 10x zoom gets right to the point-but I can see how this zoom might be overwhelming for some in which case a 7x zoom might work better. For me it helps with eye makeup application. I am very pleased with my purchase.
520,0,"Broke in less than 2 months_I bought this flat iron because the price. I should have known a flat iron that costs as little as this one did would break. I was so ticked off when right before an important interview, this thing didn't heat up. With no time to go to buy a replacement, I had to go to interview  with a rat's nest on my head."
6999,0,Don't like them at all!_This brushes are bad quality. Don't like them because the hair is kind of stiff and don't like the way they work.
4960,1,Great Set_I started buying this brand about 5 years ago and just love the quality of the brushes. You can't beat the price for the number of brushes you get. I just put a little shampoo in a cup with some water to clean them once in a while and let them air dry.
7357,1,love glitters_Iexactly what I wanted as for as glitters. I do nails and these are great for my designs I create
6288,1,Fantabulous_i love the way it make my skin feel and look. This is now a apart of my regular rountin. Ordering more soon
4997,1,Nice product_This base coat drys off very quickly. You can also use it as nail polish. It will make your nails shining. Love it.
5529,0,"Not bad but I don't like that much_As a MUA I don't find NYX base eye shadow primer to work the way I thought they would. They tend to go on thick and pasty and it takes a bit of blending to get them to even out. Also, they also tend to crease a bit which can be frustrating when applying loose powder shadow.  When applying a primer I want something smooth to go on the lid since it's so sensitive (the skin is delicate here) and I don't want to have to rub, or pull a product on the lid. I wouldn't purchase these again."
2360,1,"Great Price & Works_I got this for a little over $8. For that price, it was completely worth it because I was able to try all of the Konad items (stamper and scraper, special polish, and plate) to have it to compare to other generic brands. Please beware that it will take a lot of practice and patience to continue to get each design to look the way you want it (it will become easier as you practice). It also serves as a great item to bond or have 'girl time' with a friend, mother/daughter, etc.FYI: Great alterntive nail polishes for stamping are: China Glaze (chrome); Sally Hansen Instant Dry; Pure Ice (metallic/chrome); some Wet n Wild nail polishes; and any really thick polishes."
5414,1,"Too Faced Cosmetics Amazing Face Foundation, Honey Beige_I didn't think that the Honey Beige looked too dark for my fair complection, however when it arrived in the mail, I knew by looking at the box that it was way too dark for me. I don't know what color to try, I'm not rich, and I wouldn't go with anything other than Too Faced."
3841,1,Best eyebrow powder_This is the first eyebrow powder I have found that doesn't have reddish undertones.  It's also easy to use and lasts forever.
9812,1,"Great multi-use beauty product._I love that this product can be used on skin, face, and hair. 3-in 1 products at a great price are the best. I've noticed my hair is less dry at the ends and my skin is throughly moisturized."
6562,1,"Files didn't arrive_I waited almost a  month for these and they never arrived.  However, once I contacted the seller, after some discussion, she resent the item...another long wait.Still, I did receive the item and I appreciate the sellers integrity, but it was a lot of work for $5!  :)The files are good quality, and I can recommend them at this price, with an honest seller."

8686,1,"Great for removing water proof mascara_These pads are fantastic and did a really good job, by removing my waterproof mascara from my eyes. The pads are very soft and don't irritate my skin. The pads are full of moisture so you only need one to remove the make up from your face. Overrall I love these pads and it does what it suppose to do."
3238,1,"Great color_Wonderful color!! It is a little bit difficult to take product on brush, however color pay off is great! I do recommend!"
6950,1,great color_this is such a pretty color of the Revlon colorburst lip butter.  I have no idea why they discontinued it.  it goes on creamy and lasts a long time.  a great neutral that goes with many skin tones.
3368,1,"love it_This soap smells good, feels good on my skin, and has made my skin clearer and brighter.  I've only been using it a few weeks and can tell a difference in my skin tone.  I started using it all over then started to only use it on my face.  That wasn't the best idea because now my face is lighter than my body and you can really see a difference between my neck and face.  So, I have started back using it all over.  Hopefully my body catches us to my face :)"
9633,1,"self tanned moisture lotion._Great lotion that punches my skin.  Not only did it make my skin feels nice and smooth , used constantantly it provided a natural Tan glow, as if I had stayed out in the Sun ,but without all the negative problems of sun exposure."

I mean it instantly.My scalp was sore and flaky due to the heat and even though I use sulfate free shampoo for dandruff ( I have ethnic hair, and I do Brazilian blow out)nothing has worked as well as ojon!Please change the smell?!!"
3680,1,"I love my skin now!_I truly love this product. In fact, I got one for my mom the week after I got my own.When I have first debating over this product, I was on the fence about forking out so much money for it, but after hundreds of rave reviews from users on Sephora, here, and my personal friends, I decided to give it a try.I am SOOO glad I did. This product is really life-changing! It's everything it's promised to be and more. After using it just for a day (AM and PM), my skin was glowing and looked noticably healthier.Also, I have noticed that my products have worked better since using Clarisonic!Yes, it is expensive, but if I'm going to spend so much on my skin products (moisturizers, eye creams, exfoliants, anti-aging creams) every year, I want to make sure I get the most of them by having the cleanest skin possible.Everytime I use this, I feel like my skin can breathe (no need to get expensive facials anymore!). I have also noticed my blemishes heal about three times as fast as they did before."
7658,1,Beautiful Dust Glitter for nail decorations._Quality dust glitter sparkle for nail decoration. I have found different ways to use the dust glitter for nail art including tattoos. The dust glitter is easy to use. I would use this company again.
147,1,"Love this product!_I love this face wash, I used with my MIA tool daily,my skin just glow.This product is very gentle,so if you use havy makeaup like me you need to wash your face couple times with it, which is no problem or maybe use a gentle exfoliant from time to time.Loooveee it, and would recomend to my best friend!"

9530,1,"Inexpensive and Works Well_I have very curly hair (3a/b if you are familiar with form of hair identification). I also co-wash ( use conditioner as a shampoo instead of regular shampoos) five out of seven days. The other days I use a low sulfate shampoo. Even then I have such dry hair, I need conditioner and a leave-in. Suave professionals did a good job as a leave in. It gave good slip with two pumps and left my hair smelling very nice. I was able to get my wide tooth comb through my wet curls and the conditioner gave my hair a lovely shine. With that said, I found if I want over two pumps, my hair would get weighed down and my spiral curls were droopy. Obviously, everyone's hair is different so YMMV."

2879,1,"It works on deep wrinkles, but I'm only 28._I'm 28 years old and I noticed a deep wrinkle started forming on my furrow line making me look older and kind of mean. It wasn't too prominent but I panicked and started using anti-aging products even though I was mostly fighting acne up until that point. Anyway, I bought couple of Garnier products: night cream, skin renewal cream, around the eyes cream and this one to use it just on those furrow lines. After about a month of constant use before bed time, I can tell that it works. The skin on that area is much firmer (before it was kind of hanging there loose). The lines are almost unnoticeable. Before, the foundation was filling them in (I just hated it because it used to make them more visible). Now, if I put foundation it does not fill those lines in any more. My skin is also oily and acne-prone, as I mentioned before and this product doesn't affect it in a bad way. No break-outs, no irritation. The tube is also pretty big. So, if you use it only on deep wrinkles, it will last for a very long time."
5406,1,love it!!_I love all of ed hardy tanning lotions!! This is only for experienced tanners and who love tingle lotions!!  It smells good abd goes on smooth!! It's the real deal I've had it before so I now the product I received from Amazon was the real deal!!
1601,1,Great buy_Thanks for my brushes!!! They r plastic which is great cause u can set them in nail polish remover and NOT have to worry abt them being all sticky like wooden painted ones

3463,1,"Eye Hope Works but it not the Miracle_I am giving this 4 stars only because the Philosophy Miracle Worker is a good send. But because of the retinal in the Miracle Worker I found switching back and forward between the too options (about every 2 - 3 months), allows my skin to not grow accustom to treatment, saves some money and still maintains my under eyes. I use this in the morning and before bed because gradually it will lift and brighten your under eyes. Oh, and the price was great which is why I scooped it up on Amazon.com"
6451,1,"Veryyyy moisturizing. I'm only just starting to use this ..._Veryyyy moisturizing. I'm only just starting to use this, so I will update when I see results on the brightening action the bird's nest mask claims.There is also an excess of the moisturizer, so there's enough for your neck and shoulders!"
4724,1,"Amazing, panacea serum_My mom and aunt both use this, so I decided to try it (Mom is in her 50s, I'm 27). It's incredible. Like both my mom and my aunt, I have suffered from acne and have spent a lot of time in the sun. The acne left both types of scarring- the dents and the dark spots. And we all know the sun can leave a host of damage to the skin, even if you're using sunscreen. While it hasn't completely rid me of the little freckles/sun spots by my eyes the way it has for my aunt, it has ERASED my dark spots and shallow scars.My skin is noticeably different since I started using this a year ago. It's smoother, more even toned, and the marks that I do get from the occasional pimple now (I attribute the fewer breakouts in-part to this serum) are gone much faster than before. After a few months of using this (my first bottle), i noticed that I really didn't need all the foundation and concealer I'd been using. Now I just prefer to use a tinted moisturizer (Neutrogena Healthy Skin Enhancer).This is definitely worth trying for yourself. Prices seem to vary a LOT depending on where you get it - I just saw it yesterday at RiteAid for 32$. Amazon seems to have the best price so far."
9844,0,"Been using for 3 weeks, no difference whatsoever yet ..._Been using for 3 weeks, no difference whatsoever yet.  Flakes and leaves residue when it dries.  Not certain that this product is strong enough to make a difference.  Will update later if any changes."
1715,0,"Disappointing and overpriced_While this product wasn't awful, it was rather disappointing. For $12, you get two exfoliating pads and two sets each of hand and foot treatments (consisting of gloves or socks with moisturizer inside). That's four treatments total (two for hands, two for feet), at a cost of $3 each.It would be a good deal if the exfoliant or the moisturizer were effective, but that wasn't what I found. The exfoliant seemed ineffective, and the moisturizer in this product was pretty minimal. Honestly, I would have had better results with a really good, thick hand or foot lotion -- and that's what I'd recommend you try, too."
9654,1,"MARVELOUS MOROCCAN!!_This shampoo is fantastic! I am now using the Tru Moroccan Argon Oil Shampoo and Conditioner together, and I have to say it was a fabulous choice to get them! I have baby fine hair, but I also have over two feet of it. Finding the right balance of shampoo and conditioners is sometimes difficult. Considering how fine it is, it is generally a tangled mess after I wash it-that is with all the other conditioners I have tried. Not with this shampoo and conditioner! It only took a few minutes to go through it after my first try. The shampoo has a much more subtle scent, but that's okay, because the conditioner smells so heavenly. This left my light and clean and works perfectly together with the conditioner.Great seller, super fast shipping! I got mine in TWO DAYS with Prime!! Thank you!! :)"
991,1,"Expensive, but lasts forever_I've had my Eye Bright stick for a few years now, and, because you only need a little bit of this, it really does last forever.  The Benefit brand sharpener that holds a fat pencil keeps it sharp and sanitary.I use it mostly in the inner corners/tear ducts of my eyes. I apply a bit in a sideways V-shape, and then either use a small brush or my finger tip to pat it into place.  I've also tried it under the arch of my brows and at the outside corner, but tend to be rushed in the morning, so usually just stick to the inner eye area.  It brightens that whole area!Some reviewers mentioned that they use this under their eyes, too; I've never tried that before since it seems like the pencil would be too drying to smooth into your skin.So, yes, this is pricey, but it's one beauty product that is a must-have!  A dab of this each day, and you'll look like a bright-eyed beauty, regardless of how little sleep you got the night before!  :-)"
1111,1,"Fallene Cotz Plus SPF 58 Water Resistant UVB/UVA Sunscreen_This is a really good sunscreen, it works well at blocking the sun rays. You'll get a slight tan, but it really helps to prevent getting very dark.  If you like to tan, this product will prevent  a dark tan to occur.  I use the Cotz Face sunscreen, and my face is much lighter than the rest of my body.  It doesn't have the chemicals that regular sunscreen has. It's better for the skin. My only problem is that it has a tint to it, so if you are a darker person of color, it may leave your skin looking ashy or dry looking.  To combat this I use lotion, then I apply the Cotz on the rest of my body. This leave the skin with a slight glow to it."
480,1,"Love_not only does it do a great job cleaning, it makes puppy soooo soft and smell so good! We use it weekly."
5368,1,"Good price_For this many plates and stamps, it is so affordable and such a good price! You have a huge selection of stamps to chose from, too."
9292,1,"Surprisingly excellent!_I have a similar skin care product that uses replaceable batteries and a spinning brush system that I was quite pleased with. When I saw that the True Glow system is waterproof and can be used in the shower, I was very excited about trying it.Included in the box is the device itself, 2 facial brushes and 2 body brushes with covers, a charging cradle with a/c adapter, a pink fabric storage case and a users manual.Of course, I turned it on immediately to check it out and I was so disappointed to find that instead of spinning, the brush just vibrates. How can that clean my skin as well as spinning brushes do? However, I set up the charging cradle and set about charging the unit fully so I could begin using it properly.There are 3 speeds of vibration to choose from and Conair suggests starting with Low speed until your skin becomes used to it then gradually increasing the speed as needed/desired.I have to say that the vibrating brush actually DOES clean my face and body every bit as well as the spinning brushes did and it also exfoliates and minimizes pores and leaves my skin feeling unbelievably smooth and soft. I use the True Glow on my face and body in the shower every morning and then on my face every evening. I haven't had any problems with skin irritation so far, although my skin is used to this kind of cleaning.Conair cautions you against applying any pressure while using the system. They have also incorporated a timer into the device to avoid over-scrubbing your thinner facial skin. It beeps every 10 seconds, prodding you to move to a different area of the face. After 6 beeps (60 seconds) the unit shuts off. This is the only thing I dislike about the product. I can see it might serve a purpose but because this system is also for use on your body, it's very annoying having to turn it back on every 60 seconds. I wish that the timer could be turned off because that would make this system perfect, IMO.As others have mentioned, the vibrating vs spinning brushes also make for less water splatter. This is great in the evening when I use it at my sink. I no longer have splashes all over the mirror and back splash! That may sound like a small thing but when you think about an item you'll use daily, less mess and cleanup is a really good thing.The brushes are kind of expensive, IMO, since they are about $15/ea at this writing. I'll be interested to see how long they last. Still, this is a wonderful cleansing system and being able to use it in the shower makes it worth maintenance expenses such as brushes."
7334,1,"Delicious and Delicately Beautiful_Oh wow... this is just delectable. A soft and sweetly powdered confection, it melds with you just beautifully, not screaming out at all. It really does smell like a lusciously powdered vanilla cake. I can envision this scent paired with strawberries! Yummy! Nicely done!"
8717,1,Standout_I wasn't a huge fan of the Mariah Carey collection but this was definitely the stand out. It is very similar to Skyfall from the James Bond collection. It might even be a dupe.
8720,0,"They Must Be Joking ..._I decided to try this out when it appeared on the Amazon Vine list. The black pepper, eucalyptus and sandalwood sounded like a good combo. The product description sounded more than a little juvenile - my wife and I got a good laugh out of it - but I thought I'd just ignore that and give it a try anyway.Unilever makes this, and they are a highly regarded and well known company in the personal care business. I was shocked as to how poor a product this is and how ridiculous (or worse) some of the product blurb printed on the container was. Who have they got doing this these days? And what were they thinking?The product itself was kind of creepy looking when I squeezed some into my hand. It looked and felt sticky for quite a while before producing some lather. It had some grit in it which in theory could be good in a product like this, but the amount and quality of it made it feel strange, and I don't think that effective.The scent. NOT good at all. I am glad I only washed my hands with it and didn't go any further.Now to the marketing. I'll quote a line from the back of the container:'Axe Deep Space, a relaxing shower gel that will clear your mind and leave you refreshed to be the center of any girl's universe.'I realize that this product is aimed at a younger crowd, but who wrote this, a 12 year old? Who'd be impressed by this? I hope no one. Who are these girls that are this easily impressed? I've never known any like that and happy to say I haven't. I won't even comment on the mind clearing part.And how non-politically correct can they get on a product label? I think political correctness goes too far today, but if I were Unilever, I wouldn't put this on anything I was selling. Hopefully for them, not many women read this label, or they will have a public relations problem, and they should.Family values people might also not appreciate what is suggested by the labeling here. Maybe Unilever doesn't care about them.As I said, they must be joking. If not, I'd sell Unilever stock if I owned some. They are headed for trouble.So, why did I give it 2 stars? Well, you can't give anything zero stars, if you give less than 2 stars you get lots of negative reaction on amazon no matter how bad the item actually is and people then don't read your review, and to be honest, it did act as a soap, I was able to wash my hands with it and the bad scent didn't hang around long. That last thing would be a negative if the scent was a good one.If you ask me, do NOT buy this product. If you have teenage boys, make sure they never even see this stuff."
9710,1,"Very Nice, Loved the Formula! BOUGHT MORE!_I am naturally 'Beach Bum Sun Bleached Blonde'; but due to my age; even beyond menopause, my hair is still very oily! I've been told numerous times from regular Hair Salons to Professional High End Hair Stylists now my hair is both oily and dry due to my age - this is tremendously AWESOME - worked wonders for me who is in menopause!"
8245,1,"Nice light non-irritating product._This is a very nice product.  It is not irritating to my eyes, which is unusual for a sunscreen.  It is a tinted product and evens out skin tone a little, but it is not a concealer by any means, and if you usually use foundation, I don't think this will replace it. The 'tan' shade is perfect for me and I'm a little darker than average for a Caucasian.I haven't been able to test it's sun screening powers because it's been a dreary cold winter and now the rainy season is here but it's worked OK so far.It is more expensive than I like but because it doesn't irritate I will probably consider buying it again."
8534,1,"Very nice shampoo experience, and makes my hair feel good_I've been using the Nexxus Youth Renewal hair care products for the last 10 days and love them all!  I love the scent and the way they make my hair feel and smell.  I'm 51, and I experience the hair problems that this product targets, so I looked forward to trying them.The scent of this shampoo is beautiful, but hard to describe. I think it's a mix of cherry and coconut.This shampoo creates a very creamy lather and it just takes a tiny amount for a complete shampoo. It lathers very quickly and it rinses very well. It smells so good that I don't want to rinse it out! My hair feels very soft after I use it, and it doesn't dry it out. My hair feels fuller after I use it, too.This is a hair care line that I plan to stick with."
1588,1,Good stuff_This is a great moisturizer with SPF. For years I bought it directly from my dermatologist's office and grossly overpaid until I found it here.
2261,1,"The BEST_If you love nail polish, this is the BEST product in the world! you MUST have this in your arsenal. It will unclump and rehydrate any old polish, any brand in 2-3 drops!  You NEED this product!"
2864,1,"Love this toner_I have had acne since I was a young teen, with only intervals of clear skin throughout my life; I'm forty now.  It's annoying, and disheartening, and it really messes with your self esteem.  As I got older I found the Proactiv system that worked in my twenties and early thirties was drying my skin out.  I searched and searched for a more natural alternative (I only eat natural and really wanted all natural stuff on my skin) but honestly, I couldn't find a natural product that worked, and I tried plenty.  My empty bank account will confirm that.  :)  My dermatologist put me back on retin-a, and it's helping with the hormonal acne and overall appearance of my skin, but it wasn't until I started using the repairing lotion and toner that my skin showed real, deep signs of improvement.  My Dr. says toners don't do anything.  She's not the only one, I've had other doctors say it as well.  I don't agree.  This toner rehydrates and clarifies my skin.  I wash with pure African Black soap, Proactiv toner, repairing lotion on chin and spots only, then moisturize.  I really recommend this toner.  It helps with redness, and flakey or dry tight skin.  Worth it!"
6032,1,"Found my new best friend!_This gel is the perfect weight for my Botticelli curls; it defines without too much stiffness. I use it mixed with a few drops of B'leave In after cleansing.  With only a fee clips to lift the roots and one to weigh down my bangs, my hair looks as if I walked out of a salon. Devacurls products are curly folks' best friends. Now that I have discovered them, I won't go back to those curl unfriendly products ever again.If your hair is more of the fractal type curly, the Ultra Defining gel might work better. But, this one is great for a softer type curl."
2743,1,"Excellent Product!_I highly recommend this product for thick, coarse or curly hair (this is especially good for Afro-American or Mixed hair textures). It provides superior moisture and detangling."
2307,1,"Love this product!_I love this product...it really nourishes my eyebrows and prevents any additional thinning, it's like a moisturizer for your brows...it has helped with growing them also."
7165,1,"Working for me._Got a sample of this product and now I'm here shopping Amazon for a regular supply.I used this after a sample of the curls unleashed sulfate free shampoo. This conditioner smells mild and fresh to my nose, though I get the reference to the antibiotic someone mentioned in these reviews. The consistency is like soft soap or a tad thinner.  It was easy to apply. I think these products work by doing an excellent job of smoothing the hair cuticle, sealing the hair making for much more smoothness and shine.I got a lot of spring in my hair from this product. I'm buying this stuff for the foreseeable future."
6558,1,"Work as well as the pricier ones_I'm not sure why some of the other brands of sidecombs cost twice as much as these do.  They're all the same.  I find these to be strong, flexible, and non-breakable."
2313,1,great product but expensive_This product works great on regular acne and I have found that even my cystic acne does reduce some with use.  I cake it on at night and use a little in the morning.  I switched to bye bye blemish its pretty much the same ingredients and a heck of a lot cheaper.  I have very dry mature skin and I find this to be my go to acne product.  My teenagers love it also.
7992,0,Waste of money_It doesn't come with any directions on how long to cure in uv light but every time I do it shrinks to the point that it looks horrible. Not sure if I'm doing it right but I don't like it.
5077,1,Great!_Great pins.....do exactly what they are supposed to do...hold your hair in place!
2831,1,So far so good!_Bought this for my son who just started wrestling.  Expensive but will be cheaper than taking him to the doctor with ringworm.
8089,0,Fell apart fast_I was desperate.  I needed hair extensions asap. I bought 3 packs of this..and just no. You're getting what you pay for. I took the risk because I've gotten lucky with hair extensions before on amazon but this was not one of those occasions.
893,1,"Really love the beads!_I really can't recommend this enough.  If you have a paraffin wax heater, these beads are WONDERFUL.  I love the scent, but I know it isn't for everyone.  Beads are so much easier to deal with than the bars!  The added aromatherapy makes this product a MUST HAVE!"
462,0,Better out there_It goes on fine but my nail polish will peel off the whole entire nail. It's like it adheres to the polish but not my nail so it just comes off all at once. I find myself using different base coats because this one just doesn't work well for me.
2226,0,"Chemical Pill_I tired this product for about a week no results at all.I understand it is a low strength but I was looking for some type of results.I reached out to the seller and was told it is against amazon policy to return beauty products.I have been able to return lip stick that wasn't my shade.Positives it was a complete set, fast shipping, get packaging."
660,0,"Don't bother..._It did nothing for me! I have just bleached my hair and was looking for something &#34;intense&#34; but this isn't it! It really didn't help with smoothing or detangling, I wouldn't buy this, I much prefer 'it's a 10'."
5440,1,"EXcellent  retinal_It is better than botox. Works better than stri  vectin and cheaper, much more gentler on your skin. Great stuff"
9950,0,absolutely fake reviews_To my surprise all of the buyers have purchased almost the same items. How come? I was thrilled to purchase the item but not before checking out the buying history of the buyers. And they are truly impressive. Take a look!
4736,1,"Awesome!_I had never used this type of brush before and it's simply amazing.  I use it for foundation and it's perfect.  You can use it for probably just about anything.  It doesn't really shed either, which is nice compared to the powder kabuki brush I purchased.  I definitely recommend this."
894,1,Very soft hands_This is great paraffin wax. It smells so nice and left my hands really soft and nice pretty. I love it when my hands are hurting from typing all day. I just put my hands in this and give myself a nice manicure!
4567,1,Hydrating serum by Image_I love the way this product feels on my skin.  I apply it right after washing and rinsing my face each morning and night.
1436,1,It works great_Excellent moisturizer. Keeps skin soft all day. It smells awesome.I personally had a little reaction to the cabanas so if you have allergies I highly recomend you try a little dab on you hand first
8459,0,"Not getting the job done_Sure, it cleans my hair, but it isn't doing anything for my dry scalp or to prevent dandruff.I waited to write this review until I had used the entire bottle and had given the shampoo a sufficient amount of time to eliminate my dandruff or, at the very least, reduce it.This shampoo hasn't been able to do either for me. Your results may vary, this has been my experience with the Clear Men Scalp Therapy Shampoo & Conditioner.TheNeutrogena T-Gel Therapeutic Shampoo, Extra Strength, 6 Ouncewill be my next choice to try and eliminate the dandruff."
7515,1,very cute_very cute product 55 pcs seems smaller then I expected but they are really cute one the nail. In many colors.
4081,1,"I'm sold!_I was skeptical about using Perfective Ceuticals eye cream.  I've had lots of experience with expensive creams promising that I'd erase thirty of the last fifty-five years of my skin's life, but usually, they just feel good and I looks the same afterwards.I've bought most of them because the sales person was so persuasive, and looked so incredible that I was sure the same would hold true for my skin.  So, when Perfective Ceuticals wrote me and asked me if I wanted to try and review a couple of their products I went on line and looked up what was in their creams.  I was pleased to see that the ingredients were first class, so I said yes to doing a review.I put away my array of Estee' Lauder products, which I thought were working well, and tried out the Perfective creams.  I really liked the eye cream.  It was nearly unscented(I have thrown away more bottles than I can count of creams that have too strong a scent), and literally absorbed straight into my skin.All was good and I was more than happy with the eye cream until one day I noticed something different.  I'd had a patch of dry skin just below my eyebrow that would never go away no matter what I used on it.  I'd resigned myself to this patch and just worked around it with my eye shadow.Then one day I noticed that it was gone.  I was amazed.  I had been using the anti-imperfection eye therapy twice a day for about a month, and the dry-scaly skin was completely gone.Needless to say I'm going to continue to use the eye cream and the face cream from now on.  Perfective Ceuticals has a fan for life and I'll be ordering more before my current jar runs out.  I've never used anything that works this well."
4552,0,"Not for me._I visit a popular skincare forum and so many people raved about this sunscreen for having good UVA protection (rare in the USA) and being &#34;cosmetically elegant&#34;. However despite my skin being oilier, it still dried it out like crazy. I peeled from this stuff it was so bad."
440,0,"Not for Sensitive Skin_I just purchased this cleanser and found it to be harsh. I have good skin, but it's sensitive and was quite disappointed to find my skin very tight and dry after using it. I think it's better suited for normal to oily skin.If you want a high quality skin exfoliate that doesn't leave your skin dry, check out louisebianco.com - they make a product called Derma Polish - it's not listed on their website so you have to call them to order it.  It's about $25 but it's remarkable in that it removes dead skin and leaves your skin feeling moist and looking great."
3581,1,Great exfoliating Skin Towel!_This towel works so well. I just add some liquid bath soap and I feel super clean and soft! Great for reaching your entire back.
593,1,"The best so far_This is truly the best hair product I have ever purchased. I've tried hot oils,serums, leave in hair conditioners,countless other products. Granted, I don't often try very expensive salon products ,but all the good reviews of this on Amazon convinced me to take the plunge. I have dry, frizzy,wavy hair from years of dyeing and now even more fanatical dyeing due to my graying hair. I was considering chopping it all off and giving up as my hair either looked dry and overstyled (after blowdrying) or limp and lack luster (after air drying it). This product within one use convinced me this is the best money I've ever spent on my hair! I feel like Ive turned back the clock 10 years (I'm 40) My hair, after one use, is soft and manageable and shiny. I have only used it, so far, after letting it air dry. But I'm convinced it's going to yield a great result after blow drying also. I will be so upset if this is ever discontinued. I will buy this again. I think someone else mentioned it being their Holy Grail of hair products. It's certainly mine, already!"
6463,1,"Works well on my sensitive skin!_I have tried numerous moisturizers for my sensitive skin, and have not been satisfied with the results. I opened this box with the expectation that this product would be like the others. After a more than a week of use, I am very pleased with the result. Simple Kind to Skin Replenishing Rich Moisturizer exceeded my expectations and I am feeling a difference with my skin!I have trouble with my face being rough and dry, but in the past, when I used moisturizer, I would find my skin reddening and breaking out. With Simple Kind to Skin, I didn't have those problems. My skin has lost its roughness and I haven't had any breakouts! My middle-aged skin is starting to have much nicer appearance and feel - something I didn't think I'd ever have again.I like that no fragrance can be detected - something that most fragrance free products do not hold up to. I also love that only a small amount of moisturizer is needed to cover the face/neck, so this bottle will be lasting quite a long time.Finally a moisturizer that works for me!"
8319,1,"Fun, effective, and a really great value._Suave does a great job at making great haircare products, both for kids and adults, at reasonable prices. This mousse is no exception.  It works well and is a great value."
6391,1,great for crease_I use this brush to add color to my crease and then to blend it to create a beautiful effect. works well when doing smoky eye.
8744,1,love_love the formula. my lashes are amazing!!! doesnt fall off. i can take it off very easyly.  I recommended . love it
8820,0,"Does not work very well_I am always on the lookout for new eyeliners and mascaras because everything always smudges under my eyes. This eyeliner does smudge slightly but not nearly as bad as most others. What I am disappointed in is the fact that the tip is so slim that it's difficult to apply, and it is difficult to get a dark line. It ends up taking much longer than my regular eyeliner and it's not worth buying."
8439,1,"Goes well with Clear Men's shampoo_I have nothing valuable to add to what others say about this other than mentioning that it's also good for guys' hair and works well with the brand's men's shampoo.  One little complaint is the shape of the container which you can't stand up.  Other than that, I'm quite happy with this."
5940,0,"poorly made_I guess you get what you pay for. This was cheap but I was hoping it would work. Alas, it is too flimsy."
6755,1,Nice colors!_I'm a makeup artist and I'm very happy with this product! Nice colors and they last. I like it! Yes!
8112,1,"Love this hairspray!_This hairspray has great, long lasting hold without making my hair look like it's coated in hair product or feel crunchy. I've started to use this spray whenever I put my hair up (since I have short hair, I need a lot of help keeping it in place) and it stays in whatever style all day long."
7344,1,"Actually I have become a regular user of this product._I am already using a good moisturizer calledZENMED- Omegaceramide+Extreme Hydration Recovery Moisturizer Rosacea & Acne Treatment, Redness 60ml. But never thought of using a separate one at night until a good friend of mine bringing me this. Later on I understood the importance of this product. Actually I have become a regular user of this product."
4919,1,Best hair detangler out there!_I have tried many leave-in hair conditioners/detanglers and this is the only one that I love. It even works great with my hair extensions. The smell is lovely and it does not weigh my hair down or leave it greasy. I will most likely buy this product for the rest of my life! I highly recommend!
2933,1,"Nice on the body, a little greasy on the hands_Texture/Moisture: As others have noted, this lotion can be a bit greasy-feeling.  I first applied it to my hands, and was delighted at how well it moisturized them, until I noticed they stayed a little *too* moisturized and greasy -- but then again, I wasn't using it as labeled -- for the body.  When I tried it immediately after a shower on my body, it was fantastic -- on freshly patted-dry skin, it absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling soft and smooth.Scent: The very first whiff I had smelled like a rich all-natural creamsicle, maybe (reaching a bit) -- but since then I've only smelled a very distinct, but not-quite identifiable citrus scent with a tiny hint of vanilla.  Almost -- but not quite -- like a strong key lime pie perhaps.  My fiance and I enjoy the smell for the most part, and it fades fairly rapidly on the skin.Overall, I found this to be a great lotion for prompt application right after a bath or shower, especially during the winter, but too greasy for use on the hands or during a hot summer."
9438,1,"Good Booster_This product is designed to boost already colored hair. It does next to nothing for hair that hasn't been colored.It is easy to use, wash and condition like normal. Use a towel to press out the excess water and apply about a quarter sized blob of the product. Spread it from roots to tips, trying to get the product everywhere and evenly distributed. Leave it for at least three minutes and then rinse. That's it; red colored hair will be boosted nicely. If you have thin hair, the product will also stain your scalp. The red stain goes away after the next wash.The color boost lasts about a week.It is kind of complicated to figure out which of these colors to choose. The box has a list of color codes for different home applied colors. From the John Frieda website, this particular Glosser Warm Blonde should be used with shade names like: Golden, Honey, Caramel, and Beige."
8748,1,So Pretty_This is large hair clip and I love it. I have received many compliments about it because it is just gorgeous. Totally worth it in my opinion. I greatly enjoy it.
9927,1,"Nice mix of control and scalp massage..._OK... I don't have much hair, but I still appreciate a good brushing/scalp massage. This brush is a great choice for that, and I enjoy it a lot.The cushioned bristle base is my preferred brush style, as it allows me to apply pressure without having to re-adjust my grip or force. The bristles themselves are a little on the soft side, so using it is a bit more gentle than when I use my other brush (that has bristles that are more stiff and wire-like). I can see how if I was working through a thicker head of hair, this would be a nice mix of gentle pressure (no hair pulling) and ability to stand up to tangles.Even though tangles are the least of my worries, it does a good job of flattening everything down after washing. So long as I don't have to take it out in public (I'm not a fan of the color pink), it works great. :)Disclosure:Obtained From: ManufacturerPayment: Free"
1113,1,"Works fine for most of us, but not for the child I wanted it for_I ordered this because it is advertised for sensitive skin -- and my daughter gets rashes with most sunscreens.  There are only a couple of brands I've found that work for her; unfortunately, this is not one of them.  It is oil, fragrance and PABA free -- but is not paraben free.Having said that, it worked great on the rest of us -- my children and I were at the beach in the hot Florida sun in July for about 5 hours and none of us got anything close to a sunburn.  It is smooth, skin-toned, and goes on easily -- doesn't smell, and seems to work just fine.  Of course, most sunscreens work well for us, so that is not a big surprise.  It did seem to be a bit more effective than some brands we've tried.  I can't say for sure whether it works for those with sensitive skin but no paraben allergies -- but can say we probably will stick with less expensive brands for the rest of us, and with paraben-free brands (like Burt's Bees) for my daughter."
3387,0,Pure trash_This product deserves zero stars! While they arrived almost instantly and they were packed well the nails themselves are not useable. The nails come sized out into individual plastic bags.The nails are long and curved over just like a fingernail. I dare say that no humans toenail has this much curvature.Each nails sides are cut straight and look unnatural.Worst of all many had splits in their centers or bent tips.I only needed one of the sizes ( I lost a big toe toenail to an accident many years ago) and EVERY single one in that size had a split in it!Product went straight to the trash !
4510,1,"Pretty great, tricky to apply._I'm a natural redhead, so my main concern is very pale skin and blonde eyelashes. My natural ones are neither sparse nor thick, long or short- I'd say they're pretty much average.This mascara lengthens quite a bit when I apply two coats, the thickening is okay, but probably could use some work. It's a 'lash tube' or 'fiber' mascara, and those are always tricky to apply, but I've found that when I use this brush I rarely have the 'gap' caused by not getting mascara all the way to the bottoms of blonde lashes and I really like how dramatic it looks.This formula is tricky to apply, though. It's been the same with every mascara of this type I've tried, including more expensive brands. Here are my tips for getting it just right-Apply all eyeshadows, concealers, and powders to eye at least 1 minute before applying mascara. I'd recommend an extra sweep under your eyes with a neutral colored powder. I don't use primer because I can't find a formulation I like, your mileage may vary. Carefully let it dry without moving your eyes too much.Keep an old, used up mascara wand or eyelash comb handy. This formula is meant to curl your eyelashes, which is why it comes with the scoop shaped brush, but that means once they are dried in a certain shape, they will stay that way. Be sure to wipe the wand on the container to keep clumps off the brush and comb out any clumps or they will be permanent! I find that applying my second coat with the tip of the wand and sort of pushing my eyelashes into the shape I want is best.This stuff tends to 'travel' if my face gets greasy during the day. Generally, a washable formula is better if you have that problem. I would definitely not buy the waterproof version since waterproof usually means oil based."
7981,1,"Love this Serum_This is the second bottle of Hyaluronic Acid Serum i have purchased i havent finished the first one but wanted a backup.This Serum looks like water but is thick not runny so far i am very happy with the results while using this .I use this twice a day morning and night i dont even need to use a full dropper i use 3/4 and that is enough to spread around my face than i follow up with my face cream .I have noticed the lines around my lips have faded almost not there anymore and the bags under mys eyes have faded! This Serum provides great hydration and the price is great ,I plan on buying this for now on since i have seen great results ! I use Retinol  at night never use Retinol during the day just incase you never used it ,you will burn ,and in the AM i use Image over this serum. Sellers great arrives fast would recommend."
5913,0,"2nd Review_My first review was deleted by the seller.  Now that I've used the product for a few months, I still cannot see a difference.  I've resorted to using the product as a basic moisturizer for areas other than my face."
5045,0,"Disappointing_This shampoo smelled nice (not as nice as the liquid hand soap) but stripped my hair and left it dry as straw, which is odd, since my hair is short and in good condition. When I just rinse with water, my hair is softer than it was after using this all-in-one.I have to use an additional conditioner with this.  Disappointed by the lack of conditioner in this all-in-one."
2162,1,Try it and you will like It!_I use this product for both my skin and hair.  I am amazed with the fact that my hair is no longer brittle and my skin is soft.  I recommend.
6107,1,"CHOICE_I found this product to be very easy to use, and quite nice.  Indeed, a choice product for the price.  Highly recommended.  DAME HILDA"
7933,1,"As Good As My Old Chi_My Chi quit working and so I looked into getting another because I loved it so much.  In my search, I ran across this flat iron and after reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I'm so glad I did.  This flat iron is just as amazing as my old Chi.  I have used it to both straighten and curl my hair with no problems.I love the features on this flat iron.  You can change the temperature settings.  You can set a lock feature so that if you accidentally hit the buttons while styling your hair, it won't change your settings or turn it off.  It also has a lock that will keep the two plated closed, which will be great while traveling. I always hated how my old flat iron would remain open when I would pack it.  Then my favorite feature is nothing new, but I love it - auto shutoff after one hour.  I love never having to worry about forgetting to turn it off.There is nothing to dislike about this flat iron."
875,1,"GREAT SMELL_THIS IS FOR ALL AGES WOMEN & TEENAGES (GIRLS), DAUGHTER INSISTS ON THIS AND RECEIVES MANY COMPLIMENTS ON HOW SHE SMELLS FRESH AND CLEAN!"
2675,1,"great lotion, light scent_Really like it. Soaks in quickly, moisture lasts a long time. It has a light scent (not at all like avocado, if that scares you) - enough to smell good, but not enough to cause headaches for a scent-sensitive person like me. I'll def continue using this and consider purchasing another. The packaging is nice too, so it would be great for some sort of little gift basket.Also, the 4oz tube is quite a bit larger than I thought it would be, and you only need to use a little of the lotion at a time, so this will last quite a while - good deal!"
2574,1,Works great but it's freaking expensive._It also stings a bit when you first apply it--which I don't really mind.  Honestly it's the best benzoyl peroxide I've tried so far (and I've tried many)... I just wish it costed A LOT less.
404,0,Black Relaxed Hair_I expected so much more from this because of its reviews. However im not impressed. My hair feels the same after using this.
9204,1,"So far, great!_Right now, given the schedule of the Beauty Boot Camp, I have been able to use two peels, waiting more than seven days in between to give my skin a chance to rest. I have not yet posted photos, because I want to complete as many peels as I can with my sample sized bottle before showing you my results. What did I notice so far? The first peel was new to my sensitive skin, so I did experience some redness and flakiness, but I knew not to be alarmed. I did not see the temporary increase in pimples that some people do experience, so I was pretty happy. My skin felt a lot softer after just the first peel, and I noticed that I had that &#34;after peel&#34; kind of flush/glow that is described in The Skin Regime. Between using the 1-4-All-Peel, as well as the recommended moisturizers and other products, I really feel like I have a chance at squashing my mild acne and getting a more even tone for my skin overall. I am very happy with this product so far, and can't wait to update you after I have finished the bottle."
815,1,"Classic white floral_This scent is uplifting, at least to me. It has decent longevity, and is a bargain at this price. Wish they had the EDP."
3949,1,"Dove rocks_This from the Man in my life:Dove's Bath Gel for Men, their recent entry into the growing male skin care market, is a sure winner. The aqua-colored gel instantly turns into a rich, foamy lather when it hits the washcloth. The scent is mild and refreshing like good soap and the feel on the skin is gentle and soothing. I actually looked forward to showering with this stuff: it's a great way to start the day or to cool down after an intense workout. Highly recommended"
8442,1,"Good intensive conditioner_Like other CLEAR products, this is a high quality item.  I like the individual size, perfect for the gym bag. The smell is okay, not overpowering in the least. The product is similar to intensive conditioning you can get at a salon, not unlike a glossing.I have short hair, and could extend the life of the product, but elected to use as directed.After 7 days the hair had a good shine and did feel soft, if a bit coated. Were I to use it again, I might try one day on, one day off. (Or perish the thought at Unilever, ONCE a week!).I do like the portability of the product, and pretty much instant results - sometimes you need an extra edge to look good, and a bit polished. I like it, but am not sure I would do 7 in a row again.  My experience may differ from the ladies with longer hair too."
3568,1,Burts Bees Tomato Toner_Natural is best for my sensitive skin.. full of garden veggies. Smells great. Burts Bees is my new facial skin care.
9359,1,"Like a soft pumice stone_Used regularly, this soft foot file works nicely to soften callused areas of your feet. The stone-like file is soft and easily gripped, then form fits itself to the area being filed so as to get into those otherwise difficult to reach areas on the pads of your toes. It seems to retain its sharpness over time but isn't so sharp as to be irritating or to leave feet feeling scratched."
8498,1,Sensative  Scalp_I have a very sensative scalp. Buying products for my hair is really hard. I am pleased with the new Axe line of products. I started seeing flakes on my jacket and decide to try some dandruff shampoos. One left my hair itchy and the other smelt bad. To my surprise Axe anti-dandruff actually worked. I have been using it regularly and I have noticed that those flakes did not come back. I have no itching or flakes so I say it worked for my hair perfectly.
3547,0,"Hot Sticks_Hot Sticks did not work for me.  My hair is long, thick and wavy.  The sticks were hard to put in and even harder to take out.  When I was taking them out it felt like I was pulling some hair out along with the stick.  My hair was bushy in some spots and kinky looking in other areas so it was not a good look for me.  This set is going to the thrift store tomorrow."
88,1,"Great product_I've used this product for several years, and I love it. It smalles wonderful, it rinses clean, unlike some other body washes that I've used that leave residue. It's also not too drying, which is good, because my skin dries out really easily.During the summer, though, I tend to get blemishes on my shoulders and chest, and I've switched to the Neutrogena Body Scrub, which I find deals with acne a little better. It comes in an identical bottle to this, and has some exfoliating beads in it as well. If you don't have to wory about bodily acne, this is a great product."
4083,1,"great product_I love organic root stimulator, there products are the best. Whenever I see something new from them I make sure to buy it. I bought this today because I always need something to control my edges. This works great and it does not make my hair hard. My hair feels nice and soft after use and it smells so nice. I opened the jar and I could not stop smelling the gel, it smells like perfume. Try it, it is a great product."
5805,1,right on target_This is a great little gadget for the days I can't seem to get mascara on without getting it everywhere but my lashes....it really works!I had my doubts when I purchased it but for the few cents I spent can honestly say I am glad I have one.
7182,1,Beautiful color_My daughter wanted me to buy this color for Christmas and she loves it.  Beautiful shade of brown with some subtle bronze/gold colored flecks mixed in with the color.  Highly recommend.
1884,1,"Great product - one of my all time favs_I'm a long time fan of Superstar Shampoo and Conditioner and highly recommend it. I have fine coloured hair, yet it is thick and gets knotted with many conditioners. This is one conditioner that makes my hair combable at the end without making is so silky it goes flat.  No sulfates in this too which is an extra bonus.  I LOVE the smell too - strawberries... delish! Highly recommend this one and I'm constantly coming back for more :-)"
5250,0,"not a fan_I purchased this because they were some good reviews on you tube about it, however it did not work for me, I found that it flaked throughout the day on me, the mascara itself was very dry like, it wasn't wet like, and since it was dry like, it clumped on me super fast. and also I got waterproof but somehow it smudged in the outside corners of my eye anyway, since then I have found the best mascara I love the Rimmel scandal eyes mascara in the neon orange tube love love love"
8376,1,Great product_These blenders are great. I received two shapes in four different colors just as in the picture. I received my package well before expected. I am very happy with my purchase and I would recommend this vendor and purchase products again. I only wish tracking info were available and I would have given a 5 star review. However you can't beat the price for 4-blenders when some Brands charge 20.00. They just aren't worth 20.00 from any Brand. This is the best price for this product I've seen so far. I am very pleased.
5511,1,Great bargain plates!_Often times you get what you pay for but that's not the case here! At a fraction of the cost of the &#34;name brand&#34; plates these totally exceeded my expectations. There are some very minor differences in a few of the specific designs on these plates but for the price this is hardly a complaint. I've been extremely pleased with these plates and after many uses they've held up well. Great product!
6455,1,Amazing shine and body_There's only two product on the market that offer rollers  with built in heaters. This one does take the full three minutes to heat up but the shine and volume is beyond anything I've ever had. It's counterpart heats up faster and provide curls that lasts but does produce the amount of shine and volume this one provide as  does this tool although volume this tool provides does not last long without styling aids.Clips designed specifically to fit rollers snugly without leaving a dent in your hair. There is a bit of a learning curve to secure the rollers in such a way that it doesn't fall over but it's manageable and since you own it you have time to figure it out. Once you get the hang of it you won't want to go back to your old rollers.There's room for improvement as far as packaging is concern. I'd like better if the storage is slight bigger to accommodate all the clips and the power cable minimum amount of fuzz and why not make a set of 12 instead of 8 rollers? Since you offer the extra rollers you must know that 8 is inadequate for most consumers and for the retail price we deserve to get all 12 rollers for a reasonable price.I've got these at 40% below retail so I consider it a reasonable buy.
1070,1,"Immediate Results!_Amazon offers theee best prices for Murad products even though I believe it is still high. However, after the many cautions concerning extended timeframe to see results, I was truly amazed after only 1 or 2 applications. I am just now seeing the first undesirable effects of 'having the best tan on the block' back in the day and wanted to find something that had proven results. This product also had a secondary positive effect by enhancing skin smoothness, and reducing pore size. Get alot of compliments on my skin and give alot of credit to this product."
8854,1,cool_It really seems to be good for getting into the dimples and helping to bring circulation to &#34;problem&#34; areas.  Easy to do right out of shower.
8204,1,"There's a learning curve_You've heard the saying 'practice makes perfect'. That applies to the Temptu also. It's not as easy as it appears when you watch the videos. I was afraid I'd shoot foundation in my eye, my mouth and up my nose (I didn't!). The instructions come with practice sheets so you can get it right there before you try it on your face.Most days I don't wear foundation, only a BB cream -- but for those special occasions I've always wanted my face to look perfect like those women's faces look in the Sephora catalog - you know...not a pore, not a blemish, and the dewy moist look. Once you get the hang of the Temptu, which didn't take long, I was able to achieve close to what I'd see in a Sephora catalog, as close as one can get if you're in your mid-40's.The mist is so fine, it's not like using a can of spray paint. You can build multiple layers if needed. I was able to cover a couple of faint age spots I have, and my freckles, and it felt like I wasn't wearing foundation, it feels like it's part of my skin. No cakey feeling. I also have dry skin and this didn't dry my skin out further. (I applied Laura Geller Spackle Primer before).I'm a light in most makeup such as Bare Minerals. I'm also a Light 003 in this, but I tried the Porcelain 001 (called Fair here) also and that worked for me. In the summer, Light Medium 005 may be OK when I have a bit of a tan.The only thing I didn't care for was the extra time involved with the compressor, over my usual routine. That may change as I use it more and become more experienced.NOTE:  I cannot comment on the blush or the highlighter/glow even those are listed as being included in this kit. Temptu provided me only a few foundation colors to try, no blush, no highlighter/glow."
3349,1,Subtle but nice!!!!_Such a great highlighter! I love this product so much! My grandma actually recommended this to me so I went and I picked it up at Target and I got to say this product is fantastic. I love liquid highlighters I feel like they apply nicer without being to glittery or making you look like a shiny monster. I really enjoy the fact that this has a pump too. The color is a pinky-silvery color but without looking to fake or unnatural. It is perfect!
6175,0,"Nothing special_I decided to buy one of these sponges to find out what the big hoopla was about. The seller sent it on time and that was great. Now, after using it once to blend in my foundation, I decided to wash it out. Wrong. I tried using makeup cleanser liquid soap, I tried several other soaps and makeup removers but nothing got all the foundation out of it! I honestly didnt see any difference when applying with this. The only good thing I can see is that you can use the pointed end to apply in the corners of your eyes. It is soft, not hard like some reviews claim."
2862,1,"Pretty color -- Secret Peri-Wink-Le_I like this color, a pretty periwinkle! The formula is just okay, a little runny. But it's definitely not impossible to apply, not a huge deal."
9405,0,"Better on the Shih Tzu before brushing than on me_The key to using the Toni&Guy Classic Smoothing Lotion is to use a very small amount.  On my hair, the results are continuously poor, with a weighty feel and scent that is offputting, but when used to assist in the brushing of my Shih Tzu, if I simply put a teensy bit on my hands, rubbing them together and then petting the dog, I can achieve a result with less static than without the product.  I don't care for the scent on her either, but since it's not as close to my nose, the fragrance doesn't offend me as much as when it's on my own head.  Additionally, the tube is much larger than the three and a half ounces of lotion it holds, so I wondered if the tube I'd received might have leaked in the package.  There is no protective seal on the tube, so my rating knocked off a star from an average to a below average review of the product.  For the price, it should have a seal.  None of the listed ingredients are high end and the tube is simple."
5656,1,great tools!_These tools are easy to use and work great although there were no instructions or samples to go by.  I had to go online for that but they do work nicely.
4933,1,"Wen rules_I have used wen for a year now and I love it. I was a huge skeptic because i have thick, dry curly hair that I have had to use expensive products and lots of them, for years. I can actually just use the cleansing cream with no conditioner and my hair is manageable and soft which is unheard of. I use this treatment once a week so even though the jar is small it lasts me a long time. It smells so good and works great. When i just use the cleansing cream I leave it in for the duration of my shower and then put a little of the cleansing cream in my hair as a leave in conditioner but when I use this too I rinse the cleansing cream out and then keep this in for the duration of my shower. I makes your hair incredibly soft. I recommend it."
2552,0,Not the same as the red out_This stuff was watery and the color was not concentrated at all. Did nothing to correct the yellow tones in my hair.
3493,1,"Great concealer for my dark circles_I've been using this concealer for awhile now and just recently ran out, so I needed to restock. I love this concealer and highlighter duo. I have dark circles under my eyes that are hard to cover. This works really well and leaves a light sheen under my eyes to deflect the dark circles. The highlighter is great too below eyebrows, on cheekbones, etc., but use it sparingly. A little goes a long way. You can't beat the price for this great product."
4948,1,"Love Gelish!_This color is a light agua-like color. The picture seemed a little grey to me, but its brighter in person. Gelish makes great products!"
8572,1,Great lasting fragrance_+ Great fragrance during and after shower+ Long lastingNo complaints. This is simply a great shower gel for men!
6959,1,"Another Too Faced item for me to love_I got curious with the recent flood of BB creams on the market. What's this about? How is it different from tinted moisturizers, which I already enjoy? I found one of the magazine sites comparing some of the top contenders. When I read that the Too Faced had a more glowy finish, I knew this was going to be my makeup for my wedding. It's beautiful. Big day and every day. For the surface of the skin, I like a less-is-more approach to makeup. I've seen too many women with mature skin make the mistake of heavy coverage, creating a tired mask-like appearance. This tinted beauty balm affords enough breathable coverage and a radiant finish. While it isn't a long-lasting makeup, I'm fine with the way my face looks at the end of the day with this.I've tried a variety of cosmetics, have worked with a variety of brands. Many of them higher end than Too Faced. For my slightly drier skin type and for the youthful healthy appearance I favor, this is one of the best makeups I've had the joy to experience.Edit: minus one star. I wish this was completely paraben free."

9879,1,"Swimsuit season!_My daughter just had her youngest baby six months ago and is getting nervous about swimsuit season. I decided to purchase this Stretch Mark Cream for her to try and to help boost her self esteem. She really likes it! It's too soon to tell, but she is in good spirits that it'll work and in the meantime, her skin has been super soft and smooth!"
7499,1,"So much great product for the price!_The selection of colors is beautiful, there is a lot of variety, and the essentials are all there. I am so impressed with this brand and this product. I have pretty much only been buying NYX products lately because the quality is on par with fancier brands at a fraction of the price. I highly recommend this!"
3497,0,"Very talc smelling_I bought the vanilla and grapefruit scent and it smells like neither of those things. It smells like grandma talcum powder.  It is so hard to get off the bad for you anti perspirant to only smell and sweat on natural deodorant anyhow... I am still on the hunt for something that works. I've done the toms stuff to no avail, .next I am trying weleda.  This is very expensive and I expected more based on other reviews. I've loved the L'occitane anti perspirant for years and am trying to get off the crack! I'm using this so as not to waste it seeing how I paid $18 but I am not happy about it."
1076,1,"Finally a Product for After You Shower_I've been using this product for about 6 months now.  While I've found some great body washes & body scrubs for treating body blemishes/breakouts since those are used IN the shower, you are washing away the medicine & it can only do so much.  I found the washes to be more useful for treating existing acne rather than preventing it.  As much as I love the Murad & Peter Thomas Acne body scrubs/washes & they have definitely helped, nothing has been able to completely resolve my body acne, till this!  Even my dermatologist had gotten to the point of wanting to put me on Acutane.  Thankfully I just kept looking at products & found this before having to try Acutane.Pros:This product is a liquid, so you have great coverage, sprays upside down as well, which is useful for applying to your back area and doesn't stain your clothes.  It has a nice tingly feeling when you put it on & the salicylic acid continues to work throughout the day.  You will literally notice an improvement within 24 hours & more benefits with continued use.I have also noticed that my skin has gotten softer & smoother, which I haven't experienced from any other products.Cons:Little high maintenance because you have to wait 5+ minutes for it to dry before getting dressed.  So hopefully you can roam your house in the nude for awhile.When I first started using it (about 6 months ago) I would apply it daily to my chest & back after showering.  So I was originally going through a bottle every 1 1/2 months which was a little pricey.  But after using it for about 3 months, I now only need to use it about once a week!  If you've ever had problematic skin, you get to a point where you don't really care what something costs, as long as it works.  So while this was more of a hassle to me to have to order a lot, I can see it seeming expensive to some."
7319,1,"I am a woman and I love this shampoo!_It smells SOOOOOOOO good and it is so creamy!  I don't know if they sell CLEAR products in the store, but if I see them in the store I plan to buy them.  As for dandruff, I haven't seen any so it may be working.  I am not sure since I also use the CLEAR scalp oil which may be masking the dandruff.  I also have been using a new conditioner CREAM of NATURE Argan Oil so I don't know if this product improved the condition or what, but my hair is not shedding like it usually does.UPdate: Clears up dandruff problems, but STRIPS hair color immediately.  If you have a hair color, I would advise not using this shampoo too much."
9023,1,Five Stars_AMAZING! works! love it. My wife even bought one after seeing how great my skin was looking.
2342,1,"Do the job_I use these to deep condition my hair and they work great, not to mention they are a great value."
3712,1,"ldh_Great and easy to use curling iron.  My only complaint, and its a small one, is that there are no other temperature settings.  Otherwise, it is a great and efficient product.  It curls instantly and thank goodness for the glove it comes with.  You won't be disappointed."
4674,1,l like them_l like them  they feel so light on my lashes l brought 2 10 pairs and l love them l have enough for a while l didnt like paying all that money on lashes that would not last that long but l so like these thankyou
9179,1,"Little Bottle, Big Impact_Little Bottle, Big Impact! Not a miracle but a good improvement over the stretch mark's I had. After losing my male bloated belly this helped lessen my noticeable stretchies."
6877,1,Brushes_I am starting an apprentice this summer as a nail tech at a beauty shop and these will help me in achieving my goals.
3734,1,"love it_I have this particular set and I love the stamper, I like how there is a smaller side its good for small designs like maybe doing multiple flowers on a nail the small one also works better when your testing a color combination on a nail design wheel, its easier to see where your stamping the smaller images on your nails and center it better. Also it has 2 colors which comes in handy if you are doing a design the same color as the stamp- for example its easier to see that a pink design went on the stamper properly on the green side than the pink. It's easy to hold and comfortable to work with. I don't always use the scraper with some designs I use the straight edge of a scrap of tag board, like packaging inserts, it works better on wider designs (because you can cut it to size) and you can just toss it out instead of cleaning it."
3035,1,"Prefer this over China Glaze_Although I love China Glaze (its my fave brand of nail polish), this is by far my favorite top coat.  It helps the manicure last an extremely long time, pretty much until I'm good and ready to change the polish."
5191,1,Helps mani-pedis last long!  Love the shiny strong feel._I tried this treatment in a nail salon and ordered my own after that.  This is a great product that helps manis and pedis last longer and creates a shinier and stronger feel on the surface.  Highly recommended.
8228,1,"Super cute!_I love these nail files. They're professional quality and come in great colors and sizes. I love that I can have a small one for my purse, a medium one to leave at work and a big size for my nail kit. They also each have their own protective cover so they're great for traveling. There are so many of them too! The only reason I gave it a 4 is because they seem to dull pretty quickly and since they're glass I don't want to throw them out like I do with other files so I was hoping they would last a bit longer. But I could be using them wrong. I'm new to nail work (I hardly ever paint my nails) but am trying to get into it so my hands don't look like giant unkempt man hands. I would buy them again."
5969,1,"Love My Little Red Corvette Blow Dryer_Baby, it's super fast (yes it is!).I used to use the blow driers with the brush attachments, because otherwise my hair would frizz up. Well, they stopped making them so I stopped blowing my hair dry. For years.Last week I used the Remington D3710 Fast Finish Turbo Hair Dryer because I had a party to go to and I fell in love with it and its magical defuser attachment. Not only does my hair dry before ten minutes pass, it comes out straight as a poker when I use the defuser. It's not too heavy and it's even snazzy looking. Just seeing it cheers me up.Prince might prefer purple, but I love my little red corvette blow dryer..."
285,1,"No Kiddie Stuff For Me._I swear by this shampoo.  I've been using it for quite a few years and if I switch off to one of those fruity, flowery  brands with 'mule placenta' or some other nonsense in it, boy do I know it.  I love this shampoo and it is very economical because a little goes a long way."
6082,1,"Really great--stains fingers a bit_I've been using this for a couple of weeks now and this lotion is great! It definitely browns you (no orange tint!) woohoo! Living in the PacNW, we don't see much sun in the winter and I hate being pasty pale so I was very happy to find this lotion.  I also use the Designer Black tan extender (I'll review that on its own page) and my tan holds very well!My only complaint is that I noticed staining between my fingers so be sure to wipe your hands before you get in the bed!"
7707,0,wrong color_I asked for dark brown and they sent me light brown. Did not even open it as this needs to go back asap!
9980,1,"Beautiful, Fresh and just AMAZING!_LOVE!!! Leaves my skin soft and the beautiful scent is intoxicating! The scent is long lasting on your skin too!"
6690,1,Light and creamy_This formula is much lighter than the rose body oil. It absorbs super fast and goes on your face very creamy feeling surprisingly airy. I worried I would break out from it but didn't. All the dry red patches on my face disappeared so the next morning I woke up to a soft even complexion with zero dry spots! I can't believe how different the texture of my skin felt afterwards this is super hydrating! If you want to try a face oil but not one of the herbal scent ones this is an excellent alternative. Your face will not reek of roses! This oil is very subtle so you will not be gagging from the scent if you use it as a night cream like I did. I highly recommend trying it!
2381,0,"What does vibrating help with? Not much._It certainly didn't make my skin super smooth, and I didn't see much of a change in my blackheads. I believe the vibrating part of this product is just a gimmick. This is basically a little pad with medicated acne/blackhead treatment in it, and when you get it wet it foams a little. The first time I used it it was new and fun, but after that it dried out my face. I would definitely recommend a light oil-free moisturizer to be used after this. I didn't see any change in my blackheads after a few weeks of using this. I recommend products with alpha hydroxy acid in them, that will for sure help with blackheads and pore size.Pros:Fun to use.It has Salicylic acid in it, so it can help with acne somewhat.Cons:It dries out my face.My face is always a little oiler the next day whenever I use this product.I didn't see any change in my skin for the better.It didn't exfoliate very well.The vibrations didn't do anything."
4959,1,Great Quality Brushes for Great Price!_These brushes are very comparable to the high-end brushes you would buy from the mall or expensive makeup stores. The difference is they're affordable and eco-friendly. Very soft brushes and hair does not fall out even after washing them every 2 weeks to maintain care. Great quality for price paid!
6703,1,Affordable!_These nail art brush is perfect! Every size brush you need is in here! All of these nail brushes is wroth the price! I recommend it! :)
1834,0,MANGO BUTTER CREAM??  BUT THE AD ON AMZ SAYS RAW MANGO BUTTER??_Do some research before you buy this product.  I'm not sure if it is truly raw.  It says mango butter CREAM on the package.
6626,1,"Rubby-Dub_This is a very thick, creamy body-wash with a very subtle scent. I use about a tablespoonful on a wash cloth which works well with our soft water.Since using this body-wash I haven't found it necessary to use lotion on my arms and legs , as usual.As for the 'toning'*********come on , People, it's only a body-wash!"
749,1,"made my hair go almost blond_I have what my stylist calls &#34;ash Brown&#34; and it naturally kind of turns a little red in the sun anyway and I really turned red headed when I added this stuff in during my trip to Puerto Rico!  I even had some blond high lights.  It was fun for a little while but constantly conditioning it got annoying (your hair dries out a little bit) so I stopped using it, dyed my hair darker and got a deep conditioning.  It as fun for that year but I would not recommend constant use.  Just like during  a vacation or something and then let it fade out as you do not want to dry out your hair too much"
7620,1,Great camp towel!_Got this towel the other day in the mail and could tell right away that it was quality! I plan on using it as a camping/backpacking towel. It is super light and very absorbent!
807,1,"My favorite hairspray EVER_This is a great hairspray!  It does not make me gag when I spray it on my hair in my bathroom like some other hairsprays have done.  It is lightly scented and holds my hair all day, no matter what the weather.  You can even use it as a styling spray!  Absolutely my Holy Grail of hair sprays!  :o)"
4270,1,"Relaxing... this hand soap leaves soft hands..._This product review of the Baby Ganics Fine and Handy Foaming Hand Soap, Lavender, 8.45 Ounces is part of my obligation to Amazon for accepting to be a member of the Vine program, a club of selected customers that provide opinions about &#34;new and pre-released items.&#34; We enter this club by accepting free copies of products but we promise in return to submit an opinion.Lavender is part of the mint family, native of the old world, found from Cape Verde, Canary Islands, Southern Europe and Eastern Africa&#8230; For centuries, lavender lovers have preferred this scent because it relaxes and soothes.Hand washing is a rather important habit to encourage and the experience through scented soaps is attractive, so when we received this product we tried it. The product is &#8216;non-toxic&#8217; and moisturizes the hands, leaving them soft and smelling fresh.Sincerely recommend this product if you want to enjoy washing your hands and if you don&#8217;t, the product will leave your hands so soft that you may regularly do this important aspect of hygiene."
2276,1,me like :)_This is a really good product I love it. It holds your makeup for hours. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it runs out fast because its more like a spray not a mist; over all I love it and recommend it :)
9380,1,"MY NEW NIGHTLY OBSESSION!!!_As a woman who has many, many, skin problems: acne, eczema, fine lines, dry skin, sensitive skin, etc. finding the right anti aging cream that will moisturize my skin, without making it OVERLY oily and send it into acne oblivion, is almost impossible. While surfing Amazon, to see what new organic creams might be out there, I came upon Yalmeh Aloe Vera Cream..I read all of the info : aloe based, vit, C, E, no parabens, it seemed to good to be true..I ordered a jar thinking this would be just another one of the many, many creams that ended up in my &#34;anti aging hoarder bathroom drawer!&#34;  (LOL) When I received it, I noticed how very, very, (and I do mean, VERY THICK) the cream was. So thick, it almost had the consistency of a thick Elmer's glue when you're trying to spread it, while it's drying.. But after I cleansed my face, used my toner and serum, I started to apply this cream, and it spread surprisingly well over my face..(By the way, it doesn't take much at all.) The next morning, my face was so moist and soft, I couldn't believe it. I thought this cream was going to be way to thick and heavy, especially for hot, humid summers down in Alabama. But no; your skin just drinks this in like water. It's been about 2 weeks since I first got this, and I've been using this every night, and my acne scars are fading, uneven tones are brighter, and my acne is much more in control.  I use this as my night time moisturizer, only because it is so thick. It says you can use it day/night. Because my skin is soo sensitive, I have to use a much lighter cream in the a.m. I would highly recommend this cream to ANYONE. I imagine it would be perfect for dry, itchy skin, aging skin, or oily skin. My skin has a little of all of that, and I have seen a HUGE improvement!! Thank you Yalmeh!! My face is all the better!!"
6532,1,"Lots of Color!_Wowee! This product has so many colors! I love being able to play around with all of them. I wish the packaging was different, and you could break apart the elements for easier storage. The pigmentation of the shadows, blushes, and lip colors is really great! The blushes are not very wearable, maybe better for darker skin tones, but I'm pretty fair so they looked a little wild on me. I love that the possibilities of eye looks are endless! This is the perfect gift for a beauty junkie! It has colors perfect for neutral and crazy bright looks. The colors don't crease and stay put, but go on a lot better with a primer. If you are trying to build up your makeup stash, this is a great thing to purchase!"
2331,1,Lays your hair down well_I love how this products lays my hair down and makes it smell nice. I usd this when i wear my hair in a ponytail becausd it makes my hair look smooth and friz free.
4744,1,"Super Holder_I enjoy using my glass on my liquids. It is a big help, Making sure you don't use a lot of your liquids. EXtremely awesome, and will get much  use out of it. Thanks Amazon, for using this seller"
2886,1,"Pretty Much PERFECT!_I'm in love with these glosses - they go on and feel like a lip gloss, incredibly moist - but they have the color and pigment of a lipstick. I'm not a huge lipstick fan, I've never liked how it feels or how it smells so I was hoping this was the perfect compromise - it really is - no odor or taste, the only drawback is that it's a little goopy when you put it on and it takes some work to get an even spread across your lips - but it doesn't fade as quickly as gloss, and as it does fade it doesn't do that lined feathering a lot of lipsticks do - it just slowly fades off your lips - so yes, you do need to reapply it every few hours or so.If you're a lipstick fan then you probably won't like these as they don't stay on like a lipstick, but if you're like me and not a fan of lipsticks or stains - this is the perfect product."
2538,1,"Remarkably Effective_This is absolutely perfect for flat heads. My hair is fine and silky and completely devoid of volume. I always use a volumnizing shampoo and conditioner followed up by a volumnizing spray. I normally purchase these products from a salon and pay a lot more for the privilege.I had run out of the Paul Mitchell Volumnizing Spray that I usually use and bought this product in a pinch at CVS. I was hoping this would at least nominally work but my expectations weren't high.This actually ended up working as well as my usual brand at easily half the price. I applied it to the roots of my freshly washed and towel dried hair and let my blow dryer create the adequate volume I needed at a low cool setting. In five minutes my normally droopy hair looked fuller and had more lift. My hair didn't have a lacquer feel to it and it had a nice scent which was subtle and fresh. Overall, my hair looked great and kept its shape in hot, really humid weather.This is a great product that does what it promises at a reasonable price point."
211,1,"liky_it feels good when you use this for at least 2 weeks 1.7 oz its too small, It was on time and well packedNext time I will get the big bottle"
6989,1,"oil setting spray_love this product!  easy to use, works great, no problem if you get it in your eyes, feels good going on, LOVE LOVE LOVE!"
5958,1,Good stuff_I get compliments all the time on the fragrances I wear. This is no exception. It is a smooth and mature scent.
15,1,"The ONLY thing that works_On my oily eyelids (I know I know, they say I am blessed because oily eyelids = less wrinkles), but when one ends up with raccoon eyes over and over after trying gazillion eyeliners, one tends to forget the blessings.Glad to have found it on Amazon, because all the local drug stores (no matter whether  in CA or OR, where I spend most of my time) seem to run out of this particular product first!Women must know and appreciate this wonderful eyeliner and snatch it right when it is delivered to the stores.It does require some practice to put on just right, but once I got it, I never want to go back to other eye liners.Also, as somebody else already mentioned - take care not to put it on too thick, it will then flake (well, any make up when piled up too thickly will flake.The only con that I can think of is that it thickens up before I can use all of it, but this seems to be the case with my mascaras too.  Maybe I do not use it often enough?"
3541,1,"Really works!_I love this product. I'm 25 weeks pregnant and have developed acne on my back. I researched all of the ingredients in this body wash, and everything seemed to be safe for pregnant woman, so I gave it a shot! It's really helping to dry up my acne and prevent new acne from developing. I would say it's somewhat drying, so I'm not sure I would recommend using daily if you have dry skin. However, my hormonally crazed skin is quite oily, so I use it 2x a day, and am quite pleased with the results."
1536,1,"LOVE MY NAILS..._I have been using this for quite some time now and I love the results. My nails are finally really beautiful and long.... However, do not wait until the polish starts getting clumps and hard to apply it doesn't work as well during this time and its messy as well... have always back ups... Enjoy Ladies you won't regret it...."
6937,1,"What a nice surprise from Cheeky!_I have so far purchased many image stamping plates... but these Jumbo plates from Cheeky are the best of all! Highly recommended! Big images, for big nails, and small ones, of course:) Great variety of images, and some symmetrical images for both hands:) Great stamping quality... buy it, you won't regret it!:)"
9505,1,"Works well..._My daughter uses Suave Kids care products all the time and they work well she has long curly thick hair and it leaves it fresh smelling, soft and manageable no complaints really love that it's two in one as well. Add some leave in conditioner/detangler maybe even styling gel all from the Suave line and you are good to go. The prices are usually fair as well."
5204,1,"Color Chart Advice - Zazzy Piece, Quick Up Do!_Per another reviewer, I went to [...] enter in the name SalsaLoosa and it will come up.  At least here, you can see a tiny picture of the color and the name of it, the chart on Amazon does not have all the colors available in this piece.  My screen made the color look darker than what it appeared to me when it came- picking colors on screens is very difficult, fortunately, most people can easily wear two colors.  As I tint my hair a dark brown, the one that is light chestnut and the darker one both look great!  Most people when they tie up natural hair, the part tied up is lighter (the ends), especially if you are processing, sun etc. Now, if it is dead on top of your head, it probably will stay on, mostly.  But I recommend a few biddy pins in it or expect it to leave you.  To give you the messy bun look, they left the loop of hair loose- which is part of why it looks natural when it is on.  Few pins, your set.  It looks very small in the package, but when put over a pony tail on top you your head, it really filled out- perfect.  Do not judge the color while in the package or the size- it really worked once I put it on."
6371,1,Does the job_This product does exactly what I hoped it would. Helps use my tanning lotions and buff it out for a more natural look.
3576,1,"So Far So Good...._Finding good products that actually work for African American hair types can be a difficult task.  I've been on the hunt for good hair products that moisturizes, reduce flakes, safe for relaxed/color treated hair, helps breakage, and doesn't weigh your hair down.  I've tried almost everything!!  From Soft Sheen (Anti Breakage/Dandruff), Organic Root Stimulator (Carrot Oil, Coconut Oil, Hair Fertilizer), Sulfur 8, Top Brass, Dr. Miracle, Motions, Castor Oil, etc.  But I was never completely satisfied with either of those products.  They either didn't work, still had flakes, didn't smell too great, or weighed my hair down.Carol's Daughter Marguerite to the RESCUE!!! I LOVE the smell of this hairdress.  This is my 1st time using it and so far my hair feels light, moisturized, and smells GREAT! The price is a little steep for a hairdress but I think it may be worth it.  You don't need to use much so 1 jar could last you a good while.  As I continue to use this product I will update my review if I experience any changes."
1466,1,"A staple in my scent armory_This is a beautiful scent with prominent notes of vanilla, apricot, amber, and patchouli. Beautiful in its own right, it also forms the base for other the other 'Love Potion' variants: LP Pink, LP Red, LP Black, as well as special edition seasonal LP variants. For a while after discovering this companies fragrances, I avoided the original Love Potion because I feared the patchouli. I didn't want to smell like a head shop or a hippie. But this fragrance is neither; it is feminine, complex, and very balanced. It is also unlike anything I had ever smelled in a department store (I strongly dislike department store fragrances)."
6815,1,"YAY...SHANY!_Everything is awesome...from the highly pigmented and blendable eyeshadow colors, to the excellent coverage concealer, lovely lip shade and beautiful blushes...I love Shany products and won't use any other...especially when it comes to there eyeshadows...Can't go wrong purchasing this kit...worth more than the price listed at $59.95...WOW! :-)"
2557,1,A real essential product_Since I first discover these bath brushes I've come to think they are an essential product.  Not sure I could shower without it. Easy to do your entire back with it.  Great for reaching the back of the legs.  A real must have.
5659,1,Like it_Love them they work for what I need them for
9841,1,"Very light face moisturizer, good for every day use._This is the second product I have ordered from the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; line.  They are both quality products and well packaged.  This Emfacize cream is very light and doesn't feel cakey on your face.  It dries quickly and works well with my makeup and other beauty products.  Essentially no smell."
2816,1,"Great!_Great light, great mirror. I love it.Gives the room so much bright light, and it's really nice looking on my face"
9773,1,"Great stuff!_Great small sponge, gets the job done! A great product from Real Techniques."
2028,1,"Delicious and smooth_Very smooth lotion, makes my skin so dang soft I end up feeling myself up like a weirdo. Softness stayed even after some hand-washing. Soaks in fast, extremely yummy smell. Exactly like those creamy fruit ice cream bars. Scents ( I have both this and the chai tea scentThe Naked Bee Chai Tea Hand & Body Lotion 8 oz lotion) don't last a long time, but for a little bit, yes. Never knew bee's smelt so good naked! Will continue to order as long as I can afford to.I'm prone to acne and I consider myself sensitive skin but I've had no negative changes since using this product on my face."
2630,1,"A little too stiff_This is a good product for the money and I use it to give volume, especially in updos. But the bristles are just a bit too stiff and I worry about damage. But I would recommend it to be used gently."
8701,1,when i saw the price..._i ordered these simple wipes in quantity because i am saving about half...i keep them on my dressing table and in car...these are a time saver and perfect for sensitive skin...l
6554,1,"not bad._I first purchased a cheap old stamp from walmart, which wasn't picking up anything.  this stamper is nice, picks up well although there seems to be a flat section on the very top which can leave a blank spot if I press too hard.I liked the scraper for a while, till I saw how badly it was scratching my image plates, and leaving streaks.... I'm using an old credit card now."
179,1,"Good for those days when you don't have time to wash your hair_When the weather is cold, or you don't have time, this shampoo will quickly get your hair clean. Perhaps not as clean as the standard hair wash, but clean enough to wear to work or head to the store while still looking good.Recommend."
1578,1,"Seriously tough hair dryer_I have had this hair dryer for a few years now. In all honesty, I bought it because it was pink. This thing gets very hot, and has a lot of power, but with that power comes a lot of noise. The number one thing I like about this hair dryer is that it is very sturdy. I have dropped this thing, abused it, broken pieces off of it, and haven't really taken care of it, yet it continues to work flawlessly. Just yesterday the cord stopped retracting without some help, but given the abuse this has had, I don't think it is a product flaw. I highly recommend this for teenagers, people who travel a lot, or just anyone who tends to use things more heavily than others."
9918,1,"Easy to use for beginners_This curling iron is from a reputable brand, doesn't cost too much, and is easy to use - or in my case, to learn how to use, as I am a hair styling novice. I have a hand me down curling iron from my sister, which is no-frills and simply has an on/off switch. I could never master how to use it, and its 1' barrel was a little too small for my hair length. Having watched many YouTube videos before getting a curling iron, just to see how easy/feasible it would be for me to do, I learned that 1' barrels are good for shoulder length hair, 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 inch is good for hair that falls past the shoulder, and 2' for very long hair. (At least, this is what the beauty gurus on YouTube told me!) This barrel size is perfect for me, and the heat control makes it easy to adjust accordingly. I used it on the higher end of hot, because my hair is trouble holding a curl. It heats up really quickly (I know this from accidentally brushing my hand against it seconds after turning it on), and the iron is easy to hold despite it's large size. It also has a kick stand which allows it to sit on my bathroom counter to cool down when I'm done using it.The only reason this doesn't get five stars is that by its second use it started squeaking when I opened the barrel clip."
2936,1,Makes my nails look terrific. I have 'waves' particularly on my thumbs_Makes my nails look terrific. I have &#34;waves&#34; particularly on my thumbs. You'd never know it when using this. Thumbs look smooth as glass after adding my polish and topcoat. Very pleased.
1668,1,"As good or better than WEN_My husband has long, naturally curly hair and has been using WEN to tame his mane.  That gets pretty expensive, a stylist told me about this product, so I bought some and it is great for every hair type, but on my hubby, it really detangles and manages his wild hair wonderfully.  It works really great for long hair, especially if you can put a liberal amount on, then braid it and let it dry or almost, when you take out the braid, it is soft and wavy.  If you can't afford to keep using WEN or can't even give it a try, use this and I think you'll be happy.  It's expensive, but it really does work."

6392,1,Perfect for Asian eyes._Perfect  size for small eyes or monolid crease defining. I use it daily to blend my taupe into my crease. And I have a very thin crease so I try to create one on my lid.
979,1,"Great product_I have long straight hair and normal cheap curling irons do not work on my hair (my hair doesnt hold the curls for more than 30 min) i saw this product on tv (the Real World) and loved how the hair looked on one of the girls. This Waver is awesome, i used it on my hair for new years last year and it held the entire night. it took me an hour to do my entire head but it worked great and i didnt have to hold it very long (about 30 seconds each hold, i know that may be long for some people i thought it was reasonable)"
1403,1,"Used for my Psoriasis_Pros:-It was a relief for itching from Psoriasis.  Now that my psoriasis is gone, I still carry a small compact bottle with this lotion just for occasional itch or mosquito bites.  For me, it works better than anti-itch or anti-puritic lotions just for a rash or itch.  As for as I can tell, perhaps my skin likes the oatmeal so I can't guarantee this for everyone.  I've also had a liking to Sauve oatmeal lotion, it smells a bit better and is very subtle like that of a baby smell/shampoo.-Oatmeal;-Odorless (could be a good/bad thing for those who prefer either way);Cons:  May be a little heavy bc the lotion is fairly thick.Neutral Comment: Shelf life is pretty good, but I wish it was a little longer."
5951,1,"Love this stuff!_This stuff is sooo good to my hair.  I decided to try this because I have a scalp condition and I use a shampoo that can be very drying to my hair.  I've been using this treatment for a year now and my hair is in better condition than ever. I usually leave this on for three minutes, but I also use it as a deep conditioner and it makes my hair feel like silk.  I haven't noticed any change in the formulation.  It's the same thick cream it's always been.  Great stuff!"
4751,1,"The Best of the Best_When I first used Curl Keeper, I was disappointed in my results--my hair clumped together, but weighed my hair down (I have 3a-3b curls). After reading other people's reviews about the amount of product to use, I decided to use a little less of the product and it yielded outstanding results! A little goes a long way with this product, but a little trial and error will eventually give you the most defined, soft, and glossy curls. Depending on your hair type (along with other factors like porosity, density, etc.) you may need to use another product that 'holds' your curls together such as gel or mousse. Overall, this is one of the best products for curly hair!"
2790,1,"Salon Results at a Fraction of the Cost_I have spent hundreds of dollars in salons for results that weren't as good as this !!I love that I can pick and choose exactly where I want highlights and get great color and highlights for about $20.I started with L'Oreal natural medium blonde for the base color then the next day I added the frost and design kit.  I used the cap first and pulled strands through all around my head (all by myself) and left on for 25 minutes. Rinsed, shampooed, then blew my hair dry. Without using the cap I re-applied, choosing fine strands to frame my face and other strategic places and this time left on for 40 minutes.  The results were amazing.  Using two different timings I got two shades of blonde highlights.  I'll never use anything else or waste money at the salon again.  I very highly recommend this product !! The only negative is that I had so much product left over.  I had enough to highlight at least four more heads of hair but had to throw it away.  I wish this came in a smaller size so I don't feel so wasteful."
6820,1,"Pretty but big_I mainly got this image plate for the bows. Unfortunately the images, contrary to most stamp images, are too big for my fingers. I can JUST squeeze it only my thumb. I do have slightly small hands so others may not have this problem. The rest of the images are good sized as well but fit better. Kind of disappointed, but nothing I can really do to change the size of my fingers."
6243,1,"LONG LASTING AND GREAT COLOR_Love this lipstick. looks great on women with darker skin. doesn't go on as smooth as I thought but it does last all day for me. but for this PRICE IS RIDICULOUS. YOU CAN GET ONE FOR 1.99 AT RITE AID. that,s where I get mines now."
561,1,Boars for my scalp_I needed to stimulate my scalp and I've learned that boars bristle are the best daily therapy for thinning hair. I'm not disappointed. Its REAL boars bristles and solid quality wood handle makes stimulating a snap.
8101,1,"Feels so nice!_Most sunscreens feel kind of icky when you put them on.  This one however, does not.  It feels glorious.  Very silky and smells wonderful.  It also works which is a very important part of good sunscreen.  Thank you Banana Boat for consistently coming out with great products that protect our skin from dangerous overexposure to the sun."
862,0,"headache alert_Item arrived quickly and undamaged. But, although the scent is not too bad, it is a very cheap perfume. It has a undertone of like a plastic chemically smell. Probably a drying agent. This gave me a serious headache."
7748,1,"Great moisturizer and hardly any scent_I'm surprised that so many people complain about the scent of this cream.  To me it has very little scent.  It is very light and goes on smoothly.  Usually after I apply most moisturizer my face feels dry again in a little while..  I like something that feels creamy on my skin all night and my skin does not look dry the next morning. I've been using Shiseido products for many years but not only did they stop making my favorite products so that I had to find them on Amazon, they have gone up in price outrageously.  I'm 78 with very good skin and decided I didn't need to be paying that much for skin cream anymore. I've tried several but this one is the first one I've tried that really seems to be what I wanted.  It is l.7 oz but it goes a long way as it is so light and easy to apply. I added the collagen cream to my regime and am very pleased with the combination of Revitalift Serum, Collagen cream and this Revitalift triple power cream.  To me my skin has improved in a little over a week and yesterday I went to the store with no makeup at all except mascars."

4234,1,"I've Tried So Many of Them!_I've tried so many of the chemical-free sunscreens on the market including California Baby (stick and lotion), Sunny Days (stick), Ocean Potion Naturals, UV Natural Baby, Neutrogena Sensitive Skin mineral sunblock, Alba Botanica 'SUN' kids mineral sunscreen...to name the ones I can remember. I like BurnOut Kids the best for several reasons: 1) it works well even on my son's pasty-white skin 2) it's not greasy at all 3) it blends in really well and doesn't leave you looking too white. 4) And most important, it got really safe marks on the EWG (Environmental Working Group) web site. The only negative is it leaves your skin with a slightly tacky feeling, but to me it's much better than a greasy feeling."
3026,1,"Love it!_I'm a single white guy and a little heavy ;)  So I want to make sure I'm clean and smell clean.  I love the smell of this and it works great with the AXE applicator.  I use it most every morning, super easy and like I said, smells great. Not to strong, and manly, not girly."
7314,0,"Quick Fix but not a long term solution_10/24/13I'm in my mid-thirties and 75-80% grey in my roots. I've been dying my hair since I was a teenager and though my brands have changed, the color has always stayed the same. Typically I use Revlon Buttercreme or Colorsilk (love them both, Buttercreme is the best) in Dark Brown or Brown/Black (30N or 20N -  depending on what's avalaible). Unflortuantly, my hair is fried and it seems like I have to re-color every two to three weeks. The hassel is getting to me so I decided I might try to let go of the coloring. But, that leaves it's own problems. Now I have a 1/2 inch of silver/white roots and then a stark line of dark hair. I already cut it above my shoulders, but the past has shown me anything shorter doesn't suit my face. And, because my roots are peppered a bleaching and blonde dye job gives me a very similiar effect in the reverse...my roots appear to grow in much darker in two weeks and bleaching is far more destructive than dying! I went the salon route but it wasn't much more helpful and trips like that aren't in my regular budget.So I started to look for alternatives and the infomercial for this grabbed me. I bought mine in Rite-Aid and taking the advice of other posters who noted the color was darker than expected I bought the light/med brown. While I will say this made me feel much better about the upcoming Halloween party, it is not a regular everyday solution.Pros:*The grey is gone and even the next day I still couldn't see it after my shower. I did NOT wash my hair that day but I did rinse and comb it under the water.*I was feeling unloved by the kitten and the hair color brought us together...she was fascinated with the smell and couldn't seem to get enough of me....she kept climbing on me, sniffing my hair and nudging my face, and then trying to grab my hair with her claws....that has never happened before -.-*It wiped right of my skin and the smell was minimal*The spray nozle helps keep the color concentraed rather than all over. I've used others in the past from the beauty supply store that seem to get as much color in the air, cupboards, and my shoulders as they did in my hair, so this was a nice feature.*There was no transfer to my pillow or the furniture, even after I slept with it in my hair all night.Cons:*The light/med brown was a shade or two too light for my hair. So, the grey was gone which was good, but if you were looking directly at me you would see a color difference, like when semi-permanant color fades out of your roots.*Went back and bough the dark brown/black and that was too dark...damned if you do and damned if you don't...*The dark brown/black had a much wetter consistensy and did not come out as evenly as the light/med brown...why, I can not tell you but other reviewers mention it too.*There will be transfer if you touch your hair...I sprayed a light coating of the light/med and let it dry for a half hour. When I lightly felt the area, nothing. When I scratched my scalp, there was color on my fingers...the same thing happened hours after my shower, scratched my head and ended up with colored fingers. It washes right off, but I'll have to remeber not to put my sunglasses up there.Biggest Con:*I was hoping to return one of them, but it turns out that the two colors work best together. The dark brown/black blends the top of my head the best, but the light brown/med brown works best when I spray the underneath layers. This makes the cost really expensive...I also bought a mascara wand for my temples (where the spray would be too close to my skin) so the cost for all three was $28...I could color my hair almost 6 times (3 months of color) for that. I doubt the cans will last three months of daily use.Overall I would have felt like it was a good deal for special occasions if one can would have been good. However, at this point it really is cost prohibitive if you have a large amount of grey, or a large area of grey roots, or a color that is inbetween the cans. Perhaps if you are one of those people that just has a grey streak or patch, then this would be for you. Or, in the case of a special occasion or emergency...THIS IS NOT AN ANSWER to hiding roots while growing out your hair however.I guess I will have to use the level 2 washable color until my hair is less brown and more grey. I was trying to avoid it because of the damage, but since henna doesn't work for me and the spray color is too expensive I have no choice!UPDATE 10/26/13So, I broke down, returned the Grey Away and bought a level 2 (washes out in 28 shampoos) hair color a shade a two lighter than what I usually use. In order to color my hair I needed to get the Grey Away out, so I washed my hair, twice, using anti-dandruff shampoo and a heavy conditioner. I couldn't believe that the color was still there when my hair dried. I know some washed out because when I rinsed my hair the shampoo was a dark brown, but you couldn't see any difference when I got out of the shower...no grey, just color, except for in a few places where I sprayed just a small amount of the light brown.  I ended up coloring over it and my hair turned out darker than the box color indicated...go figure."
3158,0,:-( It burned me_Stung and burned my face. Definitely not a repurchase. :-(
97,0,"Mascara is soft but not full_This product does not live up to its name.  While the mascara is soft, it is not full.  To get a desired full effect, I have to apply the mascara at least three times.  The mascara also takes a long time to set and dry.  I will not be buying this product again."
5453,1,"Works on all hair types!_I'm 100% African American with natural hair. I've been trimming my hair myself but I was unable to acheive any length because of my ends! As soon as I cut them I would have split ends a week or two later! I randomly bought this on clearance as well as the leave in conditioner. I knew the rest of the line probably wouldn't benefit my hair type since I use products for natural hair. Anyway, I didn't really like the leave in since it made my hair sticky and matted. The overnight cream was heaven sent though. After I washed and conditioned my hair normally, I twisted my damp hair while applying my normal deep conditioner and the nexus to my ends. Co washed it out in the morning and viola! My ends were perfect! I knew I wasnt just seeing things either because my hair was easier to detangle and styling my hair is faster than ever. And I applied this stuff over a week ago! I think if you know how to section your hair when applying product you will be fine."
7773,1,"LOVE IT!!!_This is amazing!! Such a great concealer for such a cheap price!! I won't be using all these colors but if I want to do other people makeup, this will come in handy!!"
9809,1,"Feels fresh!_This facial cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean and very soft. I have older, normal to dry skin with some past sun damaged areas. This makes my skin feel completely clean without feeling dry and tight.Smells so pretty and just takes a few drops to thoroughly clean face and neck area. It lathers up beautifully too. Rinsed away completely with a few splashes of warm water leaving no traces of make up or lotions.I was given a sample of this product to try for my honest opinion. That having been said I really do like this  facial cleanser and since I have started using it my skin feels  great!"
8289,1,"Love the smell and texture_I've been using this shampoo for a little over a month, wanting to give it a full trial before reviewing it. It has a creamy texture, light color, and very sweet smell. It lathers up well and rinses well. I have long hair -- a little longer now than it usually is -- and I found my hair is easy to comb through after using this shampoo.Did it add shine to my hair, which is, as I mentioned, long, and straight and currently in the middle of a dull, dry winter? Not that I noticed. But my hair did feel softer to the touch after using it. So overall I'm happy with the product."
4727,1,Nice Mirror_I use this mirror both at home and when traveling as it fits nicely in my luggage and is lightweight.  Great for both putting on make up and plucking eyebrows.  If you want to see your whole face then I would suggest going 5x instead of 10x magnification.  Could not find the stand in the box but then it may have gotten thrown out accidentally so I cannot comment as to whether it works.
1368,1,bath and beauty_This is a high quality product for dry skin. It is not overly perfumed and not offensive but does not smell bad at all.
7090,1,"Good quality peel_I waited before providing a review because I wanted to use it for at least 4 weeks.  This is a strong but gentle peel, and it works, you will have skin shedding. I used this product on my arms to get rid of my uneven tan from the summer.  It will sting when applied, but isn't unbearable. I experienced micro flaking as opposed to peeling in sheets.  I am very pleased with the product  and looking to try other peels in this line."
4353,1,"love it...purchased multiple times_this is my favorite half-wig. it stays in good shape for a long while, especially if you take care of it properly. when it starts getting scraggily i give it a nice &#34;salon&#34; cut."
7428,0,"Not Best Choice For Sensitive Hair/Scalp_This gave me big suds, so I was hopeful. However, I never had a SHAMPOO that felt this DRYING until now. I found myself re-shampooing in the shower as I could feel my hair start poofing up after the first shampoo.  It felt somewhat better with the addition of a conditioner (even though it was loaded with drying agents) from the same line. Once out of the shower, the overall affect on my super curly, thin hair was wispy cotton...Update:Had to downgrade my reviews for this line when the skin on my arms and neck started breaking out after accumulated exposure-washing my daughter's hair in the sink in addition to using other products from same line on myself that day. Not the best choice for sensitive hair/scalp."
2277,1,"Wonderful sunscreen, unscented_Finished the first bottle that a sephora rep recommended, so had to get another one from here. I like how it's not scented (like how most sunscreens are). It does not cause breakout on my face either. Really good size for the price. Highly recommend."
6739,1,I LOVE this palette!_I LOVE this palette!! It has such great colors and they are very pigmented! I would chose this over the UD Naked palette any day!
6237,1,"A good quality product_I am an African American woman with natural 4a/4b hair. I love this conditioner. It's very moisturizing but I don't think it has enough slip to serve as a co-wash. I usually apply it the traditional way right after I shampoo or I will apply it on dry hair and deep condition. It really doesn't matter to me. I like it either way. I like the fragrance too. I've never bought the large one with the pump, but I will probably buy in the future. It sounds more convenient. I hate having to turn the bottle upside down and shake the product out."
6965,1,"Effective for travel_My wife took these on a trip to southeast Asia and she reports back that they were a sort of minor lifesaver. She toured in some out of the way areas and she made extensive use of these towelettes, not just for removing makeup, but for general freshening up.Obviously the package is light and easy to carry, and 30 towelettes last a while (the package lasted the whole month she was away).Now, not everyone is going to go to southeast Asia for a month, but just about everyone is on the move at times, and that's a good time to carry this package along.She did not report any downsides so I go with a five-star rating for usability and practicality while away from home."
863,1,great everyday scent for my husband_purchased this for my husband for father's day and he loves it. I definitely will recommend others to try it.
6983,1,"A wonderful product that smells great.  When paired with the Orange Petalooza Gud shampoo, hair looks beautiful~_This a very nice product.  Our family uses it with the matching shampoo and our hair looks and smells amazing.  My daughter's frizzy hair is tamed and my wife says it looks &#34;calm and beautiful.&#34;  The pleasant scent of this product lasts until the next day (in our case anyway).I highly recommend this product.  My family and I used it with excellent results."
3944,1,Bar Soap_Bar Soap is soap. It cleans. It is good. Like any other soap. Its mens soap. What is the difference between mens and other soap. I do not know. Are they cheap here. I do not know.
8038,1,No chemicals-that's what I love!_I have been using this product for the past few months.  It takes some getting used to and haven't mastered the perfect combination of vinegar and/or salt yet.  I am happy that I am not putting harmful chemicals on my hair/scalp.  My hair feels softer and shinier and I get compliments about it often.  I will continue to buy this product.
6714,1,Like this for dry skin_I like this for my very dry skin. After peels it is very comforting. Not as greasy as some others I have tried. sinks in and feels good.
6873,1,"long handles_The handles are much longer than I was expecting and it takes a LONG time to get these, but there are many of them, designed to do different things, so just handy to have -- can certainly use them for other delicate painting also!"
7055,0,"The best Shea butter out there but CHANGED buying options!_This stuff is pure shea. After trial and error with different brands, I finally know what pure Shea is.It's soft, an ivory to off beige color, with a strong nutty scent. It melts upon contact with skin.I absolutely love using it in mixes with cocoa butter, olive, and coconut oil for a body butter in winter. I also use this same mix as a sealant on hair, but I will discontinue that soon since I already use a heavy leave in cream for hair.16 ounces lasted me one year. I purchase from coastal scents website in November during their 50% off sales, making the butter around $5 for one pound. For me it's more cost effective to buy it this way every year, especially since I only use shea butter in winter.I would recommend this particular shea butter for anyone who wants real and pure shea with no gimmicks.UPDATE from 5 stars to 1 starAs of 3/2014, the company no longer sells 1 pound bags. They now sell 10 ounce jars of their shea butter for a higher price than the 1 pound bags were. Unacceptable to me. And the next size up is 5 pounds for about $40 on their website. I'm the only person who uses this and buying 5 years worth of shea butter in bulk is not cost effective and is a waste of product. Looking for a new company to purchase from."

6518,1,"they work_I am not a professional or anything, but since I got these my make up style has improved a lot and applying make up seems so much more fun and easy. Also learned how different brushes do different things and wow yeah you get a lot of them too."
7813,1,"Curious_I have a 5 year old girl who is all about glitter.  So when I saw this product I was a bit skeptical but it was affordable on Amazon so I went for it.  Now, all the girls in the neighborhood line up.  The tattoos stay on for about a week and are very pretty.  I enjoy the joy it brings them!  Worth it!"
6743,0,"Hard and Messy to pull off_This was a tragic comedy.  I applied the nose strip, waited the designated time and then I could not get it off.  It was dried on rock-solid, and adhered like super glue.  I tried moistening it, and washing with my cleanser, and was even desperate enough to try to soak it with vitamin E oil.  Nothing would soften it and it remained on rock-hard.  Therefore, I had to scrape it off, little tiny bits at a time.The next problem was that the strip left this icky, sticky, white residue that needed to be removed and this entire process of removing the strip and the residue left by the nose strip left me with a very sensitive, slightly red swollen nose.Therefore, my recommendation for anyone who is planning to use these nose strips for the first time is to leave it on for a shorter amount of time as it may dry quicker in different climates and it may be easier to remove without the problems that I experienced."
4515,1,"TONS OF DESIGNS!_I love how many designs come with this package. Some of them don't really pick up well at all on the stamper, but most of them work great. You'll get the hang of it after time. Make sure to clean it with acetone after using a design. When you are using the same design a few times, there's no need to clean it until you're done. I will order more from Bundle Monster!"
7990,0,Two Stars_Nice for price but kind cheap looking
4684,1,"My go to iron_Low price, cute color, works great. I have thick, long hair(up to my booty) and this iron is really good. You can't take huge chunks of hair and iron it but you can do like 2&#34; at a time. I iron my hair at a medium setting of 350, the lowest is 310.. My hair always comes out perfect and silky straight. I even bought one for my sister."
6662,1,Fun_These tool pens are easy to use.  Lots of sizes.  The handles are easy to grip.  Love polka dot nails.
7076,0,not worth it_I ordered this item and it did not arrive during the expected time frame I was given. It is not worth the time or money and I wouldn't order it again. Does not come with any instructions in english either.
56,1,"My favorite color_I'm a fan of this shade from Feria - beige browns are hard to find.  My hair tends to go red whenever I color it & the beige really tones down the red without going flat or ashy.  Also, Feria seems to give you a bit more dye for your money so I only use 1 box instead of the usual 2 for my shoulder length hair.  I'll keep using this product as long as they keep making it."
8458,1,"Clean Hair, Refreshed Scalp_This is another product in the fine line of Clear Men Scalp Therapy.  This one combines shampoo with conditioner for scalp comfort and dandruff prevention.  Like other Clear products it is a white, creamy lotion that makes the hair feel clean and the leaves the scalp feeling refreshed.  I am glad that I found the Clear Family of shampoos and this one in particular."
9372,1,"Facial in a little bottle_I think this vitamin c serum is wonderful, after two weeks of use, I could see and feel the difference in my skin.ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!"
9172,1,"Love it!_It has a really cute lace pattern over the pink that looks cute. Holds the plates very well without tearing and you can see the plates clearly when they are inside the pockets. Fits 2 plates back to back without a problem. Not too tight and not to heavy. If you have any plates that are not circle, like I have 2 that are in the shape of an octogon(8 sides, not circle) They will not fit because they are too big."
4596,1,"best magnification_If you want really high magnification this one will do the trick.  For most general purpose use you are probably better off with 7x or 10x but for cases when you want higher magnification this mirror is great.I didn't have any problems with the quality of the mirrors construction which others have complained about.  I also like the simple design and the fact that it doesn't come with an integrated light, those lights are always useless and just a waste of space in my experience."
8829,1,"Smells nice, isn't as greasy as I'd feared_I generally have had nothing but positive experiences with Pond's, although I can say that some of their products are a little greasier than others depending on what they have in it. That's sort of par for the course, especially if you end up looking for something with a higher SPF.In any case, I was pretty pleased with this product. The smell is rather nice and is something I don't mind having on my face. By this I mean that I wouldn't mind smelling this lotion for a longer period of time since it's not really obtrusive and I don't have to worry about it causing any horrific actions based on smell alone. Moisture-wise, it seems to do the trick. My face ranges from oily to dry depending on the when, where, and how, so this evened out my skin nicely. I do recommend that you use it more sparingly on the more oily parts, but then that's just common sense.As far as moisturizing goes, I gave it the best test of all: my best friend's elbows. She has (and I hope she doesn't kill me for saying this) some of the driest, most raspy elbows I've ever seen and my general litmus test for any lotion is to use it on her elbows. This lotion faired well enough for a facial lotion. It didn't penetrate down to the core, but it did get fairly far, although I had to really rub it in. As far as how long it lasted, it definitely seemed to last for the next few hours I hung out with her. I know that the average person won't have this type of skin on their face, but I'm mentioning this so you'll know that this will hydrate and continue to hydrate your skin throughout the day.I'd purchase this with my own money, if that's any sign of quality."
6453,1,"Lightly scented, nice._I would say it is very lightly scented. It is moisturizing for a while after use. Enjoyable to use. I'm not sure if I can see long term effects, but it's an enjoyable product that I have re-ordered several times."
990,1,"Perfect Brightner_I gotta say, this is hands down the best eye brightning pencil I have found over the years. You honestly do not have to put much on. It doesn't have a cakey texture either, making it even more wonderful. I will say if you put a lot on, it will have a tendency to make it look as if you're downplaying clown makeup. Use in small doses! The last time I purchased this @ Ulta, I paid close to $20, so the price is unbeatable as well! And it also doubles as a concealer for any of those annoying skin imperfections. Since it's a pencil, you can dab it right on & when you put your foundation on, it really camoflauges!"
9518,1,"Superior moisturizing conditioner, and a budget brand!_There are many things to love about this conditioner:It smells great, although not the 'gingery' smell I expected.Conditioner is nice and thick.Hair is full, not weighed down by product, yetHair is not dry and 'crackly', not even at the ends.With just a couple of uses it's hard to say definitively that breakage will lessen as dramatically as stated, but considering that, after use, hair combs totally smoothly, with no 'catching' (what tends to lead to breakage) it appears the promise will be kept.Finally, I love that the bottle is designed to open at the bottom.  Often precious morning minutes can be wasted banging conditioner, like ketchup, out of the bottle, and some bottles tops aren't stable enough for them to be stored upside down."
5648,1,"Perfect!_My daughter (17yo) loves doing her nails, and she's been looking for tools like these to help the polish go on the way she wants. She's very excited about these tools. She has only used them once, and they were great. If needed, we'll update later (as in, if there's a problem after repeated use). For now, we're QUITE pleased - such a great value!"
8435,1,"Combine the conditioner with the shampoo for best results!_I have been using theClear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control Nourishing Daily Conditioneralong with theClear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control Nourishing Shampoo.  My hair is mid-back length, naturally curly and also color treated.  With the conditioner I use it everyday, but for the shampoo I have found that it's best for me to use it every other day. I have noticed a bit less frizz in my hair, which is most likely from my hair being less dried out.  The conditioner also has a nice scent that stays with my hair even though it rinses clean.  Overall I am very pleased with the results of the two products combined and the price isn't so high that I can't afford for it to be my regular brand."
2844,1,"Bought this for my son's acne._According to my son, this is the absolute best for diminishing acne marks, especially pimples and zits that are just beginning to form."
5780,1,Great Mask_My wife loves this mask. We use to get it from ***mart but they dont seem to carry it any more. I found it here and had to order it as many other stores stopped stocking it.
9737,0,"Irritated my allergies_I like these caress body washes, but this one, kind of aggravated my allergies. Which is surprising since the scent isn't very strong. It has a very faint floral scent, but if I didn't know it was intended to be Gardenia, I would never guess. Like the other shower gels, it has a pleasing presentation- the bottle looks good, it fits nicely in the hand, and is attractive, and is useful to wash your body, lathers well, and works well with a razor for shaving.I found after use, that my existing congestion felt worse though. I stopped using it.If you don't have allergies, you might find this to be a pleasing and inoffensive product. I prefer, personally, a scent that lingers on the skin, and this one didn't. Pleasant but not repeatable."
2945,1,"Fierce red!_I have to admit, I love colored brushes because they look better and are distinctive between my other brushes. They are super soft, also great to travel with or just for at home. A nice variety of brushes."
1087,1,Nexxus Emergencee Restorative Strength Conditioning Treatment_I like this treatment so far. It doesn't do anything spectacular but people say its the best so I feel kind of good when I use it. It does make my hair look shinier.
6590,1,"Very handy_With this price you can't expect more but one you should keep in mind that you should know how to use it in proper way because it doesn't have any manual and whatever it's written that in Chinese,one who don't know chinese they should search it on YouTube for its use."
4033,1,Shampoo_I use this and then use the leave in cream. I love all their products. I will definitely be getting more.
1837,1,"Sharp and precise; great value_I use these to trim my own hair, and they're perfect. As a mom, I cut my family's hair to save money, so I wasn't looking for a super pricey set of shears. For this use, these were the best I could find in terms of quality and value. I would definitely recommend them and would buy them again in the future. I'm glad I bought these instead of an all-metal, professional looking set that would have cost many times what I paid for these.If Goody is listening, I wish someone would develop a finger guard that protects the index finger on the opposing hand because when you're cutting your own hair in places you can't see closely in multiple mirrors, like the back of your head, it's easy to nip your index finger on the hand that's holding the hair...near the knuckle. Ouch! Just an idea. In the meantime, I might just wrap that finger with electrical tape when I do my own trim."
9555,1,Hubby Really Likes This_I love the fragrance but hubby likes the way it makes his face feel after washing and before his shave.  You don't need a ton of it either to do the job so a bit goes a ways.  The fragrance is nice and light not overpowering like some other products.  Hubby said he would use this again if I got for him and he's really picky so I know it must be okay for him to say that.
993,1,"really great, especially in photos_It really does reflect the light upwards, making eye circles invisible, especially in flash photos! I love this little pencil! I only use it under my eyes."
2711,1,"Rich and fruity_This body wash is notably less drying than others I've tried, which makes it an especially good choice for the winter. The fragrance is pleasant, though decidedly fruity, so if you prefer not to smell like a summer snack, be aware. Otherwise, I recommend it."
6083,1,"Great buy!!!_This lotion works really well! The bronzer is amazing, has a silky feel to it and smells good (for tanning lotion). Also, you can't beat the price on amazon!! Salon's sell for $50 and up for the same thing. I've been tanning for years and this is 1 of the top lotions I'd recommend :)"
2483,1,"LOVE IT but don't use too much_This amount will last you forever!  I've been using it for years now it really helps to keep the rest of the make up on and take away the shine.  However, you shouldn't use too much, it can lighten you up too much and you'll look like a ghost.  Just a little bit goes a very long way.  Try mixing it into your foundation."
7084,1,Excellent_The power of this drill is amazing....works really well. does the job nicely. Good quality given the price. i would recommend this for home and professional use. because of the power though it is kinda noisy
3745,1,Five Stars_easy on the hair
2490,0,"OPI nail hardener_OK,  this is the truth as I see it.  This stuffseems to make NO difference to my nails.  Maybeit's just my nails.  They break easily,  even thoughI'm healthy,  and don't know why.  I have used thisfor a few weeks and see NO difference.  Maybe it wouldmake a difference on your nails."
6982,0,"Terribly Disappointing_I bought this product with the coordinating shampoo, which was also a huge disappointment (I wrote a separate review for the shampoo). I didn't think I needed to sniff the coordinating conditioner after I had already sniffed the shampoo, but lesson learned: the conditioner smells awful, nothing like the shampoo. The biggest disappointment is how incredibly tangly the conditioner left my hair.  I actually think my hair is damaged, which sucks because I try really hard to use quality products & treat my hair with care. My hair ended up looking dry like straw, and I probably have lots of new split ends. This conditioner did nothing to care for or improve the quality of my hair. There are dozens of better conditioners - even natural ones - out there."
3606,1,"Golden Tan!_A little goes a long way with this lotion, so it lasts you a long time! It is very moisturizing left me skin smooth! The scent I think is yummy it is fruity yet has a coconut after scent. It had pretty good results the bronzers are nice, left me golden. This lotion would be perfect for a beginner! Happy Tanning!"
2958,1,Really wonderful brushes_Professional brushes that if you keep them clean will last a very long time.  Love they way they work with makeup and would buy again.  Got my daughter some for Christmas; she loves them too.
3224,1,"love it_This comb is the best I ever used comb ,Comb hair becomes a kind of enjoyment . It is very good."
6144,1,"Excellent for everyone!_I use this and the bar soap with the frankincense and myrrh.  I use this for my body, hair and face!  This mixed with baking soda makes for an excellent exfoliating face scrub and super gentle.  No it isn't tear free, but it is organic and smells awesome.  I'm always careful when bathing the kids anyway, so tear free isn't a problem for my family!"
5050,0,"Drying_This is a pretty, bright red color--actually quite perfect for a night out with the gals (too bright and &#34;out-there&#34; for a guy's liking, I'm told).  To be precise, &#34;Burn&#34; comes out red-orange, so you should like bright lipsticks if you purchase this.  The formula, unfortunately, is drying; you'll have to pack lip balm along in your makeup bag.  And there's just a bit too much glitter to push this lipstick over the edge to teenager-y."
4005,1,"Youy can't beat the price._I hope that this is really and merely the generic version of Rogaine because you cannot beat the price. I wish that I had the ablitiy to take it to a lab  so as to prove that it is what it claims to be, but I'm a trusting soul, so I continue to buy it, and it costs 50% less than the Rogaine that you see in the stores"
8631,1,Nice product_This shampoo has a pleasant scent and works well. Doesn't weigh my hair down and provides enough moisture to combat the winter dryness. It adds shine and cleans nicely. A trusted brand with another great product.
2134,1,"Nice price from amazon.._very glittery for a spray with bronzer, keep in mind if you have sensitive skin, or if your husband plans to use it  ;-)"
8599,1,"The Wife likes it_Remington D3020 Volume and Shine hair dryer has just about everything that is needed in a dryer.  It has good volume with 1875 watts of power, ionic ceramic technology, 3 heats settings, 2 speed and cool shot.  The dryer filter can be removed and cleaned with just a counter clockwise twist of the back.  Operation is straight forward and if you are in need of a new dryer, the Remington D3020 will certainly do the job and is well worth getting."
7726,1,"Very easy_Easy to use, easy to get tangles out. Smells nice, Fast shipping. So far it does so so on my semi wavy hair."
3574,1,Great product!_I have used the other it's a 10 (without the oil) and was not impressed. I have used mystic oil by loreal and have to say this product is the best! My hair is shiny and healthy looking!.
1873,1,The One by Dolce & Gabbana for women. 2.5 oz_I loved the smell of The One by Dolce & Gabbana.  I would definitely purchase this product again and recommend it to others.
2900,1,"Buy with confidence FROM Amazon LLC_This is my first time buying fragrances from Amazon.  And with that being said, buy the fragrances FROM Amazon LLC. I was hesitant at first because I had read some reviews regarding people receiving inauthentic fragrance or having fragrances diluted with alcohol.  This product arrived in its original box, factory sealed, in typical Amazon packaging to protect the turbulence of shipping. So as long as you purchase DIRECTLY from Amazon and not a third party seller you will be satisfied.  In some reviews I read some have speculated and cried product fraud because they are cheaper than department stores.  Everything on Amazon is cheaper than retail, but my guess is the fragrances are overstock from the previous year, hence the surplus and knock down of price per ounce. However fragrance, especially EDT, has a self life of 3-5 years.  So as long as you use it in a reasonable time frame and keep the fragrance in a cool, dark environment, it will have the longevity and maintain the pungency one is looking for.  As for the fragrance, I love this one, personal favorite.  All Versace fragrances are top-notch and made with pure ingredients and are therefore headache free. This one works particularly well with summer weather during the daytime.  Buy with confidence, from Amazon!"
7147,1,"Love this!_I got this so I could try the shade out without buying the full sized bottle and I love it! I normally use Revlon's Colorstay in Ivory and this shade is perfect for me. It's a tad greasy, but I just set it with powder and it's perfect."
4912,1,almost like the original_i used fiberwig from sephora all the time and found this as a replacement. i have to give 4 stars as it's not exactly the same formula but it's good enough that i would buy again!!!
7858,1,So useful_These are so helpful filled the whole book up this is very well made and sturdy . Will buy another when needed .
9197,0,Color not good_The color is not easily matched.  I have dark brown hair but the the dark brown came as dark grey
1520,1,"Awesome!_I still need some practice with the whole stamping thing but this nail polish is so viscous that it's also PERFECT for french tips. I just stick on some tape, paint this one and then peel the tape off. Works great, dries quickly and evenly (since the polish is intended for stamps) and is totally opaque in just one coat. Yay for being multipurpose!"
3756,1,"I love it!_I used this hair dryer for the first time today and I love it! It dried my very thick hair in no time and gets very hot. In fact, I was able to dry my hair on cool and it was still very warm. I was so relaxed that I fell asleep. I have gone through countless hair dryers in the past few years (they just don't seem to last), and this is one of the best. I was concerned about the bonnet because it didn't seem like it would fit over my curlers, but it did. I just had to be very careful putting it on/taking off. From past experience with the attachment ring breaking, I will also be purchasing a replacement bonnet if I can find one.UPDATE** The attachment ring on the bonnet has broken (why does this always happen to me?) after only four months and now I've had to tape the thing, which is not going to last. The dryer itself is still working properly, but now I need to see if I can purchase a new bonnet from somewhere. If anybody knows where I can get one I'd appreciate it."
3275,1,Works._Tried buying this online instead of the stores since the price was better. Happy with this all in all. It's much easier buying online than going to the store. Glad I can save time and money.
7197,1,"My favorite foundation_I love this foundation. It's light, airy, and makes my skin look soft and flawless. It lasts all day even in the hot Arizona summer and works beautifully over my moisturizer. I never break out with this product, and I have really sensitive skin. I hope Maybelline continues to make this foundation because it is perfect for my skin and is a very reasonable price on Amazon."
5095,1,Great sunblock._This is a great product that my husband uses every day. His doc recommended it to him. Less expensive here than at Docs office.
6522,1,Great Brush Set_This is my first complete brush set and I love it.  It has every brush I need and more. I am not a make-up artist but I believe in making sure my make-up is applied with care.These brushes are soft and do just what I need them to do.
7979,0,"The bottle has broken when I received it!_Sigh, I don't have a chance to try on it and wonder if anyone experience this before. The packaging of this serum is terrible! I have bought another serum(180 Ultima Pure Swiss, (Super Strong) Hyaluronic Acid Serum Forte with Vitamin C) at the same time and only this bottle is broken, not a single drop of the serum was left. I guess the manufacturer has to rethink about the packaging of the product, the outer paper box is very thin and there is nothing to support the inner bottle.However Amazon handles my complaint very prompt and good. Thanks Amazon! I dare not request for a replacement as I worry that it will be broken again when I receive it. I have bought so many skincare products(with glass bottle packaging) before and this is the first and the only one that was broken when it finally reached me. I wanted badly to use it but too bad, I would not purchase this product anymore!"
6466,1,"Simple, soft, and it works_Some reviewers question the list of ingredients, but most facial washes have a long list of unpronounceable ingredients. Just because they sound weird, doesn't make them bad. So unless you're a chemist or a dermatologist, don't assume that it's bad.At least one reviewer gave the product bad marks because you can't put it around your eyes. Lots of facial soaps/cremes make similar warnings. That doesn't make this a lousy product. It's not called, 'Eye cleaner' or 'Eye moisturizer.' It's for the face. While the eyes are part of the face, it's a special part that is super sensitive, which is why there are special products just for that.Overall, this product is quite good and delicate. Is it the best thing ever? No, but I'm happy with it and probably most people would be too."
4932,1,For Dad_My Dad asked me for this product. Loreal it is a good brand...but I need to be honest...I cant see nothing better in his face. For me his eyes still the same.
8791,1,Five Stars_Good
7118,0,"Sigh! No change after 2 weeks of use._I'm Middle Eastern but very, very fair skinned. However, whenever I get a scrape or a blemish, it leaves an extremely dark mark that lasts *for-ever,* aka post- inflammatory hyperpigmentation. I did a ton of research and it seemed as though my only over the counter solutions were Kojic Acid or Hydroquinone.Since hydroquinone has been known to cause cancer and a handful of other health issues, I decided to try this instead.I'm sad to say that I've been using this soap for about 2 weeks and have literally seen no change in the color of my darkened skin. I followed the instructions and left it on, waiting for some tingling to set in. It did the first couple of times I used it, but not after that, even if I left it on for a couple of minutes. The only difference I see is that my skin is pretty dry.On the upside, it smells good and hasn't irritated my skin, which is crazy sensitive. I wouldn't purchase it again but will use the rest of the soap."
6306,1,Great Product for Natural Hair_This is a wonderful product for natural hair. This product keeps my hair soft all week long. You can also use this product to do a great twist out. I have used many popular products and none kept my hair soft and moisturized pass a couple of days. If your hair loves a lot of moisture than this product is for you.
6968,1,"Really Unclogs Your Pores_Nothing unclogs my pores like these things.  Seriously, they are the best.  Just prepare to moisturize afterward because they peel off a bit of skin too, which can leave your face feeling a bit raw."
2609,1,"8 oz Spray bottle set_I really like these bottles.  I am using one for vinegar (I use it for cleaning) and one for a homemade insect repellant.  They work well and are small enough to store easily yet hold enough so that I don't have to refill them too often.  The sprayer seems to work well and I have not had any leaks.  I plan to purchase more of these for our trailer, they are the perfect size!"
8763,1,"Oh Absolutely_My niece has curly, coarse blond hair.  This product works like a miracle cleanser to help control the frizz.  This whole line seems to be excellent for coarse, curly hair!  Definite recommend."
4853,1,"Gorgeous!!!_This color is gorgeous!!  It's a beautiful deep purple with just two coats.  This polish wasn't as &#34;streaky&#34; as some of the other darker colors I've used.  And it could also be that I've learned to hold my hand down when applying the darker colors to prevent the polish from pooling at my cuticles. I added pics with the two coat application.  The next time I'll try three coats to see how that changes the color.  But, I love it just the same."
1388,1,Works well!_I use over all of my other nail polishes and the coat works well and does dry quickly! I swear by any OPI product!
6627,1,"Pumpkin mask_This really does smell like pumpkin pie. On top of the pumpkin puree, they included cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and allspice! I applied a thin layer with a fan brush and left it on for the recommended 5 minutes (but I will probably leave it on longer next time). I did not experience any burning sensation, and no redness after. I would say this is a very mild peel. You're not going to get a night/day difference in your skin, but if you get professional facials or do a &#34;clinical strength&#34; peel occasionally, this would be a great weekly touch-up."
3027,1,"CoverGirl Outlast All Day Lipcolor Clear_GREAT FOR ALL DAY USE, CARRYING IN YOUR PURSE OR YOUR CAR AND IS A GREAT MOISTURIZING GLOSS TOWEAR OVER OTHER LIPSTICKS."
6006,1,"love, love, love!_i love this stuff. i have bad allergies and puffiness and this works everytime. its a great value for the place and i highly recommend. i have very sensitive / combination and this works for me."
9577,1,"silky shine!_My Thoughts:I am all about finding products that are not filled with chemicals, this is why I have been making some of my own products. But I feel like I can recommend things that are not filled with things I wouldn't want to put on myself. This hair treatment leaves your hair feeling soft and manageable!"
3657,0,"Doesn't absorb into the skin and doesn't work (even in partnership with the serum)._Terrible disappointment. After reading all of the positive reviews, I was really surprised to see absolutely no improvement in the bagginess and darkness under my eyes."
5241,0,One Star_Doesnt look natural and comes off easy
7991,1,"Comfortable and covered all my hair_I really like this wrap.  It does exactly what it states on the package and it covered my whole head of long hair.  For those who reviewed it and said it didn't cover certain areas, I think they may not have wrapped it correctly because it worked great for me!"
3099,1,"Dewy, Glowy Awesomeness!_It took me allot of reviews later but I finally tried this for myself and man I love this stuff. I have combination skin, Mostly dry with hormonal acne. This foundation gives me medium coverage and makes my skin look great!!! This has not broken me out so far even with the SPF (SPF in makeup tends to break me out) I don't have acne all the time and my skin is pretty clear but I do have large pores around my nose, chin and forhead and this covers them. I use the Sonya Kushuk Flat Top Kabuki brush (See My Review) to apply and it gives me a nice glow with almost airbrush finish, I highly recommend this foundation. Will never go back to a high end again and I have tried them all! I will say if you have allot of dark marks and acne this may not be enough coverage for you, it's light to medium but buildable, One coat is all it takes for me to get a nice coverage but I don't have problem skin. I have fair skin with pink undertones and this line is built around my skin color, But if you have yellow undertones, It may not be the foundation for you. They really need to come out with more shade selection for you olive toned and dark skin beauties, That is the only issue I can come up with. But for me it's AMAZING!"
7846,1,Cute_These are super cute and im sure will look great on a mani. I havent tried them yet but they look really cute there are diff sizes as shown and are just what i was expecting
2298,1,"Interesting_Well, this does cut down on the time you would normally spend buffing nails, that is a good thing.  However, it doesn't eliminate the need to do a bit of filing to even out the nail. You also need to use sparingly or it will create a ridge at the base of the nail, by the cuticle, that is as obvious as a poor filing job.I had one manicurist that tried using it over the top of polish, which had a nice end look, but the polish chipped within a few days and I had to file off the rest of the polish.I will continue to use the product."
5498,1,Infiniti Pro by Conair Spin Air Rotating Styler_This spin air rotating styler works exactly like it is supposed to.  It spins around while it blows warm air to dry your hair.  It does leave your hair smooth which is why I bought it.  (I have damaged hair and it can show a bit frizzy at times).  Unfortunately I didn't think to check out the size of the roller before I bought it so it is larger than I normally would have bought.
6795,1,"It's not just red anymore_When in doubt I head to the cosmitic department for gifts for my wife.  Most things I don't know much about, but you should see what she can do with nail polish!  It ain't just one color anymore."
6317,1,"Finally a yellow BB cream!_I ordered shade 23 from the Missha US website directly and while the color was ok, the tone was not.  It was gray, even after waiting 30 minutes, which made my skin look unhealthy.  I was going to give up because I thought the 27 would be too dark, but it actually does work on my skin tone.  When I swatched it on the back of my hand and rubbed it in, it did look quite orange and too dark for me.  Maybe I just had too much on my hand because when I applied it to my face, the color was much better: not as dark and yellow rather than orange.  For color reference, I wear ELDW foundation in Tawny (3Wl).I like that this has anti-wrinkle and whitening ingredients. I haven't seen any results from them yet, but I also haven't been using this very long mainly because color 23 made me look unhealthy.  The only problem that I have with this BB cream is that it does make my face a little oily and by the end of the day my forehead looks bad.  I'm experimenting with primers and setting powders to fix this for the summer, but I know in the winter this will be perfect because my skin gets so dry."
1261,1,Great color even if just doing legs_The color after just one application is subtle enough even on very fair skin to just take the edge off the whiteness! I use it just on my legs and it doesnt scream &#34;look her legs are tan but the rest of her isnt!&#34;  It dries quickly but can feel a little tacky the first few hours even when dry. It does have a slight glitter to it which is nice.
1055,1,"works pretty well_I bought this because it finally started raining here in California.  When the rain hits, my curly hair just explodes.  It becomes a frizzy mess and looks terrible.  Normally my hair is curly with a bit of frizziness but when there is tons of moisture in the air, it's a horror show.  I bought this because I hate the feeling of hair spray, and it doesn't work for me anyhow because I allow my hair to dry naturally.  I don't apply heat to my hair, and I haven't found anything to help fight frizz on moist days.  I would say that this works pretty well.  On a day where I washed my hair that morning, applied this smoothing milk to my damp hair and went about my day (and it rained)&#8230;my frizz is extremely minimal.  Compared to a day where I use nothing on my hair, it's pretty amazing.  My hair looks like it's summer outside!  I took off a star because it does weight down my hair just a bit.  Also, I don't think it's a 24 hour hold as the bottle promises.  It isn't a miracle product.  It does what is promises and that's all you can ask for."
3024,1,"Very good product_I loved this and it's the best I've tried. Keep in mind I don't wear a lot of makeup with it, maybe some concealer and primer."
2336,1,"Best cleanser ever_I love this hard to find product, it works great and doesn't break the bank! Perfect for low grade glycol in peel too!"
186,1,"I always choose Maybelline_Maybelline has a great line of mascara at a reasonable price. This is one of my favorites. I have used this line since I was a teen and continue to use it today, into my 50's. Very simple to use, great color options, just makes the lashes look fuller and darker; and that's what it's all about  :)"
6932,1,good_it was a simple to use product. super easy to use. it is just what it describes. works great with any polish. I haven't found any designs that don't stamp.
2048,1,"Very Private Makes Wonderful Products_There are few products I use exclusively, but Very Private Body Wash is one of them.  After trying this body wash many years ago, I've never used anything else because it's simply that effective.  My skin has always been sensitive, but the onset of menopause has made it even worse.  Soaps can be irritating, especially around delicate areas.  This is very mild with little scent, but it thoroughly cleans and reduces body odor.  I just love it even though Very Private deserves a less embarrassing name.The company also makes another outstanding product calledVery Private Intimate Moisture, 2-Ounce Bottle.  I wish both weren't so expensive or at least went on sale occasionally, but on a positive note, each lasts a long time because little is needed per use.  Menopausal women or anyone with sensitive skin should give these effective products a try."
2867,1,Ageless Eye cream_This is a nice light weight soothing lotion for the eye area.  I have not really seen any 'ageless' benefits other than moisturization. The fact that there aren't harmful additives is a plus.
6582,1,"Shany nail polish_I love all the colors that are offered. It's nice to have verity of not just color, but shades, there isn't just a blue, but a dark and light version! Great buy for the cost!"
1927,1,"Better Than Others_Motions pink moisturizing hair lotion is better than some others that I have tried.  It has a nice light scent, does not make my hair heavy or flat, and provides shine and moisture.  I use it daily."
1175,0,"Doesn't live up to hype_I bought one of these from Sephora, after hearing so many rave reviews, and I'd have to say, I'm not impressed. I like for my foundation to be heavier coverage because I have some issues with acne and acne scarring and I feel like no matter how much I squeeze it out it still retains water and thins out my makeup. Worse than this I noticed it falling apart after only a few uses. Now, it has a big gash on the top rendering it basically useless. I was never hard on it and I've only had it for about a month. I think I'll just continue to use my hands from now on. I wouldn't recommend it."
9894,1,"Amazing Shampoo!_When I first tried Adovia Mineral Mud Shampoo I was honestly a little scared. Was I really going to put mud shampoo in my hair? What was it going to do to my scalp? Was it going to wash out?! Yikes... But alas, my worries were unnecessary. After the first use I noticed my hair was shiner and felt... freer? It almost felt like it was cleaner than it had ever been before. It had a great amount of movement without being frizzy. I also noticed that it did not strip any of my hair color when I rinsed, which is something I really watch for as I don't like to dye my hair too often. By the next few uses I noticed my psoriasis had cleared up dramatically. My scalp had almost completely stopped itching, there were minimal flakes, and I didn't encounter scales or lumps on my scalp anymore. This shampoo has been like a miracle in a bottle, I'm in love!"
9257,1,pretty good_this lil make up bag is pretty good but not great it is a good size but made of a cheap plastic but it would work for travel and would probably wipe off fairly easy if you spilled something on it.
6015,0,"Disappointing_I need to start looking at customer reviews before selecting things through the Vine Program that's for sure.I can wrap up my entire experience with this product with one word. Disappointing.I am leery at using any products on my skin since I do have extremely sensitive skin. Luckily for me I break out rarely but I wanted to use this product since it promises to get rid of scarring and dark spots on your face from sun damage and other things.After opening the box and watching the instructional DVD and reading the directions I thought I was ready to go.It is recommended that you use the skin care system at the lowest possible setting during the first couple of times that you start to use this in order for your skin to 'toughen' up. The DVD and the directions warn that your skin will probably turn red and blotchy after the first time using the system and it can take up to two days for it to go away. The directions also tell you to only wave over the same spot on your face, legs, etc. three times max. I did that as well. I still stayed red and blotchy for longer than two days and also started to break out where I used the system on my face.I ended up going to get a facial this past week at a local spa I love though it's pricey. At least after that was done all of my blackheads were gone, my pores looked great and I looked fantastic and NOT blotchy or red.Would definitely not recommend using."
9829,1,"These are also easy to clean and nice to stick in the purse ..._Cute case and the brush heads are convenient sizes and soft. These are also easy to clean and nice to stick in the purse while on the go or traveling.I do at times get free product/discounts in exchange for reviewing a product. However, this does not alter my opinion of the review and I do not get paid for this."
9215,1,"Fresh, citrus smell_These are really nice cleansing wipes. They have a fresh citrus smell and have not dried out at all in the packaging. The don't take off makeup quite as well as some other wipes I have used, but they work pretty well. I just use two instead of one."
1001,1,"Scariest brush that gets the nicest results!_These reviews aren't lying when they say that this brush does not tangle your locks. It cuts my blow drying in half and gives me consistent results. I will only be purchasing cricket brushes from now on because they are hassle free, durable, and tangle free.P. S. When I add too much hair to the brush some hair will go down the handle and the rubber will pull on the hair. The size makes me think I can pile on more hair (kinda like a buffet does, oops) but when this happens I need to remove the hair from the handle or the rubber will pull it out."
4849,1,"Nice polish_This color is exactly as shown.  I would call it a royal purple (not bright though) with a nice sheen.  I'm not a huge purple lover but I like this because it's a nice/neutral purple.  Not too light/not too loud.This polish arrived so fast.  I placed other polish orders a day earlier, yet this one came first.  In fact I'm still waiting for a polish that was supposed to come today, yet didn't."
185,1,"My Favorite Mascara!_Maybelline Great Lash Mascara, Dark Brownis so easy to use. One of the few brands that offer brown shades of mascara.  I am very fair skin, and black mascara looks so harsh on me.  I am so glad Amazon offers this particular Maybelline mascara as it washes off easily with soap and water.  I highly recommend this product.For Maybelline Water Proof Mascara, I recommend Maybelline eye mascara remover."
1377,1,Excellent!_Love this product and keep re-ordering because I do!Decided to get the larger one this time. Hair is so healthy and no more loss of hair
7193,1,"EOS Every Day Hand Lotion_The EOS Every Day Hand Lotion is the perfect way to beat the dry skin that comes with the change of seasons. Made from 97% natural, paraben free ingredients, this lotions goes on smooth and rubs in easily, leaving behind no greasy residue. Just a small dab will keep your hands soft for hours at a time. What I especially love about this product is the compact size. The containers are small enough to carry in your purse or even fit in your pocket, so you have lotion on-the-go whenever you need it. I even gave one to my teenager to stick in her schoolbag. They come in three scents including fresh flowers, cucumber and berry blossom that are crisp, light and refreshing and each one will keep your hands smooth to the touch through the fall and beyond."
4846,1,"Will buy again..._Love it, just wanted I needed. I will buy again, alot cheaper from buy in store. Hope the buyer has more colors."
816,1,Favorite_This is my sister's favorite perfume/cologne which I can not find in any of the discount stores in my community.  I found it at a discount on Amazon.  I now have a happier sister.
7404,1,awasome oil for the damage hair_This is oil is awasome for the damaga hair...I apply it before I start using the blower and then the iron from HSI . Since almost all my hair is falling out ...this seem to work with my hair and the amount of the bottle is good since this is Argan oil u know that is expensive so for this price is great.
1477,0,Frizz ease pleassssse_No way does this stop frizz well at least not on mine or my daughter's hair. I even used it to blow dry my daughters hair and nothing I tried it on my wet curly hair and I was frizz city as usual. The best I can say is that it's give you shine but I can get that from almost anywhere. So this will  be my first and last frizz ease purchase.
3396,1,"Have only tried it once but it's the real deal!_I expected this to be just like any other lotion, but after quickly putting some on my elbows before rushing off to class I discovered later in the day that they were much less dry than usual! I'll be using it on my knees as well for the dry winter months. It really adds more moisture than mosts other brands I've tried but without that gross film of greasiness!"
276,0,"It's just like water..._I'm amazed at all the good reviews people have given this product.  This leave in conditioner is SO watery and runny and doesn't help detangle or condition hair at all.  I knew that it was a liquid leave in conditioner, but I was expecting it to have a slippery feel to it like other leave in conditioners I've used.  This however is just like scented water.I definitely would not recommend this product.  Waste of money."
2550,0,"OK but tiny rollers that don't seem to heat_Compact and light, it initially seemed to fit the bill. The smallest rollers are TINY and don't heat up at all.The other rollers do heat up pretty quickly, but don't seem to retain heat. Like all rollers, they give off this burnt plastic/chemical scent for first few times you turn it on. I tried using them more than once to see if I just had to get used to it, but since the smallest rollers seemed defective I eventually ended up returning this and getting a Revlon brand set which I like better."
4580,1,This is Great Stuff_I don't use this by itself I add a few drops to any and all facial lotions I use and it's great.  Noticed a difference in my skin after the first few uses.  I'm going to get a facial peel this next week and will use this in the sunscreen/lotion.  I understand it helps speed up the results of the facial peel.
4837,1,"Night Shimmer_I have had this on for 8 days and it is not lifting, chipping, or peeling off. It is still shinny and looks as if I did it yesterday. I only used one coat of the Night Shimmer and it is whitish silver looking. It looked like if I put another coat it would lean more to a silver.I found the Harmony Gelish products to be thinner than normal nail polish so you want to be cleaning your brush often otherwise it runs onto your skin. No problem if it does - just wipe it off but to avoid it just keep a little on the brush. Love how this stuff just evens out on it's own to give you that prefectly smooth look."
9402,1,"like it_This cleansing brush works very well. One of the best features is that it is waterproof and works in the shower. I  use the big brush to exfoliate dry skin, especially on my legs in the winter time. It cleans and exfoliates my face very well to better prepare it for my skin care regimen which I apply with the sponge for deeper application.  The pumice stone reduces and eliminates callouses on my feet well on my 'spa day'.  It is a good assortment of brushes, more expensive systems offer 1 or 2 face brushes.  This model works just as well, or better, for me.  It is backed with a  Full One Year Manufacturer's warranty.  Good, friendly customer service."
5985,1,Love CoCoa Butter_Cant go wrong with CoCoa butter just make sure it is pure. I like how it feels it feels so good make sure you check it out see for yourself.
2320,1,"Cool Little Suprise_The wife got me one of these to try recently, I initially thought it was a ripoff and couldnt see why she bought it.It turns out it is pretty handy.  Does a great job of cleaning & the extra abrasive side is great for scrubbing the grime off your knuckles after a day in the garage or backyard.I hate to say it, but Ill probably keep buying these things."
7492,0,"I cannot in all good conscience be a guinea pig for this company again_I had high hopes for this company's line of hair products.The prices were good (meaning cheap) and the promises which were made seemed made just for me -- how exciting.My hair, which is brittle, damaged and fragile would as a result look pretty, I imagined!The first thing which I reviewed was a shampoo. In retrospect, I realize that it simply had little effect upon my hair but was beginning the spiral downward which would continue with all the otehr products I have ordered from this line.The nadir was the horrible hair cream in a jar which I tried right before this product arrived. I had already ordered this product.After I used the hair cream, I broke my hair trying to comb it through and I needed to shampoo it over and over to get the grease out.I know that many people of color defended that product, but unless it was written on the jar that it was especially made for certain hair types of ethnic origin the company did a disservice to all of us.I have never felt so unattractive in my life, as when my hair was broken off and ruined by this company.If you, as a reader of this review, think that I, who was not born yesterday, plan to try this final product which I ordered when I didn't realize what could possibly happen if I used one more thing from this company, you don't know me.I review many things, and I truly call them as I see them.The company selling this makes a perfectly dreadful product to my mind.Sorry for the strong words but nobody messes with my hair!"
6281,1,"very effective_I have used glycolic acid 70% for a while and was satisfied.  I decided to try this brand and I am glad that I did.  There is less burning (always some) and it leaves my skin smooth, soft, and very clean feeling.  I have thick, somewhat course skin, but I feel like the glycolic acid is leaving my skin with a finer texture and more youthful looking."
8768,1,"Excellent Product When Used as Part of the System_I'll start by saying the light scent of this shampoo is suitable for either gender and great in the summer when flies and bees are out in number. I hate having flowery smelling hair and having bees get too close. It lathers well, but it does seem a little clingy and takes a little longer to rinse out. That's likely because one of the ingredients is petrolatum.By itself, I didn't think this 'cleanser' did much in terms of moisturizing. It's touted as being a 'rehydrating conditioning shampoo.' My hair came out feeling rather dry and tangled. Therefore, I can't recommend it on its own.That said, I specifically ordered the three-part system to see how it would be as a whole. When used with the leave-in conditioner and finishing sealer, my curls looked fantastic. Even rain and humidity were not able to counteract the system and my hair stayed curled without any signs of frizz."
1456,1,"Best 'daily' smell good_This has been my favorite daily cologne for about 16 years.The larger size is a better buy. I buy both, as the smaller bottles are refillable."
8231,1,"Effective, a bit drying_Amazon sent me a free bottle of this shower gel to review. It is effective and very concentrated -- you will get a lot of uses for your money. The scent is masculine and not overly strong. The gel cleans effectively, but seems to dry out the skin a bit."
3533,1,love_Been using this since 2010 and love the way it leaves my natural hair as well as weaves... yes i always use this on my weaves..its great...
7704,1,Does a good job_This does a good job of removing grease and grime. It must contain a moisturizer because it leaves my skin smooth and soft.
6868,1,"Perfect!_I got this yesterday 9 or more days earlier than expected and I love it! It cuts through the nail tips nicely and you can go slow or fast and its nice! I got mine with red handles with were bright and colorful and it was oiled so it worked really nice right off the bat! I did have to wipe a little bit of the oil off but 5 stars is perfect for this because its a great buy for so little price! Also, if you have long enough nails, I'm sure it'll work on natural ones too!"
2684,1,"Good moisturizer, but not a great sunscreen_Maybe it's just me, but I haven't noticed any sunscreen effect. I applied it half an hour before going out and still got spots under mild sun... But it did reduce my redness and flaking, my face does feel smooth and moisturized. I use it in the morning and use Vichy thermal water during the day to keep my face hydrated and calm. Together they work great."
7024,1,&lt;3_Love love love it! The color is beautiful and its great for fall.  Since its a stain you get that great color all day and its super easy to apply.
5079,1,"Soooo much easier to use!_Okay so I am new to the gelish polish world and I LOVE it so far but it can be a pain in the rear to get this stuff off to apply new! This remover has worked the best so far and I have tried regular nail polish remover and straight acetone before trying this! I file off the top coat then apply this to cotton pads and wrap in foil, takes closer to 15 minutes than 10 but still the polish just slides right off afterwards. And nothing else I have used worked that well AND this didn't dry our my cuticles like the other stuff! I will use and buy again."
7897,1,Great for swatching!_Great for swatching polishes.  The clear plastic is better at getting a more accurate color read of the polish as well.
7716,1,Its Cute_I Really Like this wig its not one of my favorites just because the dark brown i ordered looks more redish brown and the curl in it lasted oh maybe 2 days of me wearing it.
446,1,"Affordable Detangler_The Suave Apple Detangler works very well.  I've used it on my children's hair, and my own hair, and it does the job.  Things I like about the Apple scented detangler is that it is never greasy, and it doesn't  weigh down even fine hair.We use it on damp hair only.  And I would add that much to my surprise that the Purple bottle Swirlberry doesn't work as well.A fine detangler for children and for many adults.  (People with processed hair should probably use something stronger.)Pam T~mom/official family hairwasher"
3120,1,Beautiful fragrance_I'm a tough critic when it comes to fragrances. I'm SO tired of celebrities selling new scents just to make money. BUT WOW...HALLE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING! This is soooooo beautiful. It's warm and exotic. It's definitely a sensual fragrance and makes me feel great. I just wish the 3 piece set was available now.
5606,1,"I Don't Usually Write Reviews But..._I had to write a review on this one.Here is a bit of background info.  I am not used to getting any acne with the exception of one cystic looking acne cyst for that time of the month or if I take too much caffeine without drinking plenty of water.  I was very tired from work and was drinking way too many energy drinks, such as Red Bulls and Monsters. {I quit doing that though - its bad for the health.}Anyway, with that I had some horrible breakouts along the jaw line. I was using Olay Detoxifying Pore Scrub {Which is still good, but} I realized that the exfoliating beads in this scrub was popping the pimples and causing them to spread further.  So I knew I needed to find another solution.I picked this up as well as the Clearasil Daily Face Wash to rotate between the two since this one said only use it up to 3 times per week and the Daily Face Wash is well, daily.  I used it yes correctly, and on the pimples I used it as a spot treatment.  I seen marked improvement after the first use.  It is harsh, yes, so its not okay to keep using it more than than the suggested dosage, particularly on the parts of the skin that are NOT problematic at the moment.What it did for me was dry the pimples OUT.  First it looked as if it was bringing it to a head but I could still see that it was drying it out from the outside of the pimple and it gradually shrunk it and dried it up whereas I could just pull the dry skin off of it after moisturizing and the skin beneath it looked brand new.  It cleared up the blemishes and dried up the pimples more and more after each use.By three days, I was almost completely clear with just a little bit of the old pimples still drying up.  So my spot treatment areas were so much smaller and I feel good again.  But it worked very fast.  It is harsh so careful with using it on skin that doesn't have acne on it. For the skin that doesn't have acne on it use it for the recommended dosage.  But the skin that's all pimpled up, can actually take the harshness. Man, this stuff killed it and I'm in love.As a spot treatment, I just put some on the pimples and just leave it on just like any other spot treatment cream.  Also I like the fact that a little bit goes along way. :-)"
1059,1,"Frizz-Ease_John Frieda products are great. I have black long hair and always looking for that extra shine. This product was it, and it does not weigh it down!"
7617,1,"Incredible primer for the price_Great applicator, smell, pric and color blends easily and makes your make up last longer. I have been using it over all with all my eyeshadows so far no creasing and lon lasting results."
2757,1,Cetaphil cream_My wife used this cream on her face and hands. She liked it as a good product. This product arrived right on time. She has used this for many years.
5139,1,I love all Olay products. ..._I love all Olay products and this is no exception.  I have very deep dark circles under my eyes.  This helps make them less raccoonier.
3451,1,"Redemption!_Even though I have been a fan of the Regenerist products in the past, I recently had a terrible experience with another Olay product (in the ProX line), so I was a little nervous about this one.  My fears were set at ease pretty quickly.  This product is noncomedogenic, which for someone with skin like mine is important.  I've been using it on and off for a couple of weeks and I haven't had any negative skin reactions.  In fact, I'm thrilled with the product.  After only four days of use I could see real results.  I have slight rouching around my eyes when I smile, and with this product that has lessened a lot, if I use it every day it goes away completely.  It is a very light weight serum and absorbs quickly and hydrates well.  The only negative is that it leaves a little bit of a slippery residue that lasts for an hour or so.  It can be problematic because I tend to rub my eyes, and then accidentally get the product in my eyes.  Other than that, this product is perfect.  It does exactly what it says it will do, and it does it without damaging my sensitive skin."
9410,1,"Very nice shine, control and smoothing_I have waist length hair, no dye or processing, that is half gray and half brunette. The gray hair is more coarse and hard to control. My brunette hair is fine and flyaway. When I have important presentations, I usually just wear it up but today I opted for keeping my hair down. My test to this product was that it provided control and shine. It has succeeded better than I had hoped.After washing/towel drying my hair I put the product in my hands and wove it though my hair, then combed. The product is thinner than I had anticipated. I needed to comb and brush through again as it dried because it dried hard in some spots. After my hair was completely dry and brushed out, there was far more shine than usual and much better flyaway control. My hair also looked like a unified 'one' instead of gray here, brown there.The impact lasts all day for me. There is no discernible scent on my hair. This product costs a bit more than I would normally spend but it is thin enough to get many uses. I'd definitely purchase it and an very pleased with the results."
3930,0,Too smelly for me_The scent of this shampoo is way too strong.  I really like the Phyto mousse but can't get myself to use this.
4131,1,"Makes for smooth magic, or so I'm told..._I got this for my mom.  This is going to be rather short because I'm writing this for her.  Ha, well, not really for her.  I asked her how she liked it and she gave me a run down, so I'm writing this for YOU based on what she had to say.  First off, I got it for her because I don't used facial lotions (I'm a guy and I'm only 25, so I don't really need it) and the wife doesn't need it.  That's not to say that my mom NEEDS it (go on, dig that hole buddy) but she is more apt to use this than anyone else I know.She really liked it.Maybe I should have just opened with that.  That's what is important, right?  The four weeks they suggest have not gone by, but after a little over a week she says that she can feel a difference.  She said that her skin feels smoother and she liked the fact that it didn't feel overly `lotion' like (I'm not sure how to describe that somewhat sticky feeling your skin gets when you apply lotion).I agree, this is pricey and the packaging seems wasteful (but to be honest I didn't even really care to bring that out until I read it in another review and stopped to think about it).  Alas, this is a good product according to my mother, and her word is law.That warrants five stars, right?"
7798,1,These are HUGE_They appear to be high quality but they are gigantic!!  Too large for me...just be aware.  I can't use them.
9962,1,"Great product - awesome price._Awesome product - worked well with my hair and provided my hair added shine.  I have thin hair so I would not suggest using this product as a leave in conditioner, but it worked well to decrease my frizz and my hair felt soft and was even more manageable.I was provided this product for free for review, but nonetheless - my thoughts are honest and my own."
6603,1,"Hassle free product that makes it easy to have salon  quality designs!_I have tried a few nail art sets in the past that have been much more expensive than this, but I'm happiest with this set. I'll point out a few things about the set that make it worth the purchase:Positives:-Price: There's no way to beat this price. I don't even know how they make a profit on this after manufacturing and shipping, but I'm not complaining.-Use your own colors: I bought the Migi nail art pens and was moderately satisfied with those, but each set has 8 colors and you have to buy a whole new set if you want a different color. With these 'Dotting pens' I just dab a bit of polish on a piece of paper and dip the end in and make my designs. I can use any of my colors and don't have to worry about the end clogging up like with the pen,-Simple: Easy to use, easy to clean.  I have done polka dots, hearts and paw prints. They are easy to do and for cleaning I just put nail polish remover on a paper towel and the tips clean up quickly.Negatives:-Case: The flimsy plastic case mine came in was broke. It's not a big deal, but I thought I'd mention it. This is the only negative I can think of.I am very happy with my purchase and will maybe be buying some sets for friends at Christmas."
8262,1,"Nice lotion, but 1.6 ounce feels like a sample size._A bath product that's designed for men that doesn't have an overpowering smell of aftershave or nasty cologne!  And, rather than feeling greasy (like Vaseline products) or otherwise slimy, it actually softens skins with an ever-so-slight 'burn' sensation - or perhaps I just have very dry skin.This is a great little lotion with a nice, mild scent that actually feels like it's hydrating and moisturizing your skin instead of simply being a layer of goo on top of your skin.  The SPF15 is a nice add-on for protection that will probably become standard in all but the most 'value' lotions; it's nice to see Dove doing it already.The oddest thing about this - the bottle is TINY compared to any other lotion I've ever used.  It feels exactly like one of those travel sizes, which would be fine were it not priced at 5X the price.  I've only used this a few days, but the 1.6 ounces isn't a lot of lotion.Recommended for the lotion aspect, it's a bit pricey for the amount you get, though."
4958,1,I love these._Worth every penny. What a difference in  makeup application theses make. A must have to have in your makeup bag.
5903,1,"100% Pure Unrefined Raw SHEA BUTTER - (1 Pound)_I love it, it is great for both skin and hair. Yes, it does not smell wonderful, but that is how the nut smells. Either mix it with cosmetic grade essential oil or buy the refined version that should be odorless."
8433,0,"Doesn't work for breakage_I have straight, limp, very fine hair that is very prone to breakage. I never use heat on it besides maybe straightening it once a week, never put my hair up in ponytails, ect..... No idea what is causing the breakage.I was told to try a keratin shampoo & conditioner so I bought this and the conditioner that goes with it. I've went through both bottles and have notice no improvement in my hair breakage, in fact my hair is breaking off even more now, UGH.The shampoo and conditioner smell okay but smell like old people to me, and they lather nice and work good and leave my hair soft, but they don't work for the intended purpose so I'm not going to buy it again."
7680,1,"This is THE VERY BEST Facial Cleansing Towelette- and I've tried many!!_I've tried numerous facial cleansing cloths, but this one is the VERY BEST!! I'm sold on it! The cloths are large, unlike some brands that you have to use 2+ to clean your face and eye makeup. It also has plenty of the cleansing solution, and you don't have to rinse it off with water. The best thing is that it contains some clay, so that it &#34;sucks&#34; out all of the grime that gets into your pores. I can actually feel it working. It doesn't dry my skin out at all; my face feels SO clean after I use this product. I really believe this is THE BEST facial cleansing cloth ever. I haven't used any other brand since I found this one. It is a good bargain, too."
3662,1,"good quality_its the first of its kind i am using its very nice quality, it does have real matte finish but it doesnt dries quickly"
9538,1,Great!_Suave is really moving into the big leagues with their professionals brands.  I've heard lots of things about the healing powers of seaweed and it seems it works on hair too!  Since I started using this my hair feels so much healthier and looks so much shinier.  Plus the smell is really fresh and clean.  I love it!
5484,1,"Conair Flat iron: does what it claims!_I am not one to use a flat iron very often. We have a very small one in the house (my teen daughter's), and I've played with it before, but I have thick hair and it took a while to see results with the teeny one.This iron is quite large with a very smooth iron surface. The heat is highly adjustable on this model, but I kept it somewhere in the middle(15), since I don't want to fry my hair. It has almost instantaneous heating up time, I'd say maybe 10-15 seconds.It takes me about 10 minutes to get through most of the hair on my head with this iron. I have a lot of cowlicks and wave, but it did a fairly good job of defeating most of those, or at least the ones on the outside of my hair.  I didn't see any significant damage after using it twice in three days. My daughters both liked the way my hair looked. It looked very shiny to them, and I thought so too.Easy to use, not too heavy and fast heating time. If you are looking for a high quality, moderately priced flat iron, this one would do just fine. It's basic, but I'm not sure what else you need in a flat iron."
2272,1,Wonderful_This product has changed my hair for the better. It is worth the price. I have had it for quite a while now and it's held up to daily use on very frizzy hair. I absolutely recommend it.
618,1,"Love it_This is the most pretty dryer that I have seen in a long time.  We haven't used it yet,b ut it looks very nice and was a t a great price."
8372,1,"Nice gloss with a natural color_I love naturally colored lip gloss, and this Burt's Bees in Ocean Sunrise fits that description.  With just the right amount of sparkle, it made my lips look healthy and feel moisturized too.Once right after I put some of the gloss on, I ate a bite of something, and noticed that the gloss immediately began feeling chalky.  Darn, I thought, I should have thought that through better, now I'm going to have to lick the gloss off and reapply.  Surprisingly, though, once I licked my lips just a bit, the gloss revived, and while it was depleted a bit, it wasn't chalky anymore, nor did it become sticky.My 13 yr. old daughter tried some of this gloss, and soon after asked if she could have her own.  She also likes a natural look.  I am thankful for companies that offer products for young ladies who want to let their natural beauty shine through.I do wish Burt's Bees had a bit  of a honey flavor or scent.  Silly, I know, but I always expect a little whiff or taste of honey when I see the honeycomb design on their products, only to be disappointed.  This would have made this product a must-have with a 5-star review for me.  As it is, I am not inclined to choose this over some of the other trusted glosses I have found, depending on what is available when I am shopping."
945,1,Perfect_Easier to layer my hair and trim my ends. Perfect for when I don't want to deal with the salon
7324,1,"Works Well, Less Toxic_Clear Men Scale Therapy's Complete Care 2-in-1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo & Conditioner is head and shoulders above other anti-dandruff 2-in-1's.  Unlike most dandruff remedies, Clear Men's makes my hair feel cleaner and smoother.  Some anti-dandruff 2-in-1's leave my hair frizzy or gunky.  More importantly, my dandruff has noticeably decreased using this stuff and the active ingredient, Pyrithione Zinc, is considered much less toxic than the usual Selenium Sulfide.  Clear Men's even smells nicer than most competitors'.  It did slightly irritate my scalp, but not so much as most anti-dandruff shampoos."
9931,1,"Finally a product that actually corrects, nourishes & moisturizes!_As a girl who honestly just loves the sun, I am constantly trying to hide my freckles and sun spots under layers of makeup. After trying Insta natural's Hyaluronic Acid I will never do that again! This stuff actually gets rid of the spots so there is no need to cake the makeup on overtop of spots! The spots are gone! My skin isn't dried out anymore & it is actually helping with my acne problem as well! The packaging was good too and I love the way the glass bottle looks and feels. I would recommend this to any woman, or even man who has struggled with dry skin, dark spots or even just dull skin. This stuff will make your skin look and feel 100x better than it did before & it's affordable which I also like!"
6660,1,Funciona_He usado este acondicionador por solo 2 semanas y estoy muy contenta con los resultados. Mi cabello queda completamente suave  y es muy facil de peinar.
1886,1,"The real deal!_I have been using Nioxin for more than 15 years and LOVE it!  It makes my scalp feel clean and healthier!  I lost hair several times over the years due to illness, surgery and stress and always found that it helps &#34;heal&#34; both my hair and scalp.  Last year I noticed that the nioxin I purchased from a salon didn't seem to smell, feel or work the same. I bought another bottle online and found after looking closer at the bottle, that it was not the same Nioxin made in the USA by Nioxin.  It looks just like the  original except on the back, the ingredients are different and it says it's made by Wella in Mexico.  I was thrilled when I was able to fine the original Nioxin made in the USA.  Make sure when you purchase your Nioxin, that it is made in the USA by Nioxin.  That explains the one stars that some customers gave their nioxin.  It probably wasn't the real thing!"
9991,1,"Seems as good or better than Gold Bond for cracked feet_I admit to having a problem with dry and cracked skin on the bottom of my feet. It is a major pain and I have to deal with it year round. For the last 4 years I have used Gold Bond and it has seemed to keep things in check, while not fully solving the ongoing problem.I was eager to try this Curel and since it is fragrance free (a must for cracked skin) I was more than willing to give it a shot. Long story short, it works and actually seems to last longer than the Gold Bond which required twice daily applications.My only actual criticism is this product seems to be overpriced. I simply cannot afford to shell out 25 bucks a bottle when I can get a 3 pack of Gold Bond for almost the same price.This Curel Rough Skin rescue is a fine product and it works exactly as advertised. However, it is just priced too high for me to consider using on a regular basis.Bottom line, great if you can afford it."
5485,1,"Best I have found thus far_I have very curly hair, its natural. Im A Black Female. I wanted to try a new look, it has been over 2 years since I have put any type of heat towards my hair. So I picked this one up because of the high heat level, which is needed to tame my hair. So I must say it does a good job. I simply blew my hair out with a dryer and comb technique then I used this. I also created curls with it, I used to do that with my flat irons. The curls come out nice. The only Issue I have is that, while using the flat iron the on/off button is located in a position where you can easily press it, so be careful. I returned the 'Remmington' brand to the store and switched for this, totally better."
5053,1,"Strong, but nice_I like the smell, but it's a little strong. I love the way my skin feels. It feels smooth and hydrated, not tight or dried out. I would be sure not to use to much. You should only need a quarter-sized dollop at the most. Love that it's paraben free and made in the USA!"
399,1,"Great, but toss the refresher._I accidentally dyed my hair too light and needed to take it down a few notches. I grabbed this in Clove (medium cool brown). Because my hair was very dry and porous from my recent overdye disaster, I put in a protein filler (which you can buy on here or at Sally's) and then dyed my hair with this. When I washed it out my hair was evenly toned, soft, and shiny and exactly the color I was hoping for. Based on all the other reviews I just threw away the booster packet, I assume it's terrible."
9061,1,"perfect color!_I love OPI polishes and decided to try a lighter color for summer. Bubble bath is a perfect color for anytime of the year really. its a very very pale pink even though it looks a little more cream in the photo, but it looks great on!"
5595,1,"soo pretty and easy to apply!_love this color, such a nice pink. goes on as easy as lip gloss. color slightly build-able. not as drying as the nyx matte lipsticks and doesn't stick to dry skin on the lips as much. I like these better than the matte lipsticks, i bought to more colors although the color selection is very limited currently. i would recommend trying these if you want a matte lip and are trying it out for the first time."
1531,1,"Got the job done but..._While using these pads I never had one breakout but... I was really looking for a product that cleared up my breakouts plus got rid of blackheads. While it kept away pimples, it didn't do as great of a 'pore cleansing' job as I expected it to."
3642,1,"Still in the Process_I haven&#8217;t used the tablets long enough to see a difference, but I will continue to use the product for the instructed time and see if I notice any difference.  I am progress in the making!"
3994,1,"My Skin Has Never Felt Better_Let me preface this review by stating that I am a 47-year-old man. After years of sun abuse and smoking I have finally come to my senses and decided that I need to start taking care of my skin. I went to the local department store to inquire about their various products. They promised me wonderful results after spending close to $200. The results were minimal and I felt like I wasted my money. A friend recommended Olay Regenerist for a fraction of the price and the results have been night and day. After only a week of using Olay Regenerist my skin feels soft and silky. It is easier to shave my face because my skin is much smoother. This is only after using for one or two weeks. I can't wait to see how it looks after a month. Also the bags under my eyes are getting smaller and the dark circles are lightening. I am so glad I found this trio of products. They are an awesome deal and work just as well, if not better than higher priced department store skin care products."
1631,1,"Great Products_Aphogee is the truth it is great for any and every ethnicity. It restored my hair back to health, thicken up my hair and helped me achieve length."
2701,1,"Vaseline 100% Pure Petroleum Jelly, 13Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)_We go through a bit of Vaseline with our baby. At the pharmacy here each jar is about $5... when amazon has them in stock, they're as cheap as $9 for 3 pack."
8333,1,He likes it_My 17 year old grandson is using this and he says it works fine just not as crazy about the fragrance. The scent is a bit odd but it is very light. The other axe products he's had the scent is very masculine and pretty strong. These teenagers like to smell good.As far as cleaning his face it earns a five.  He prefers the other axe products.
854,1,"FOR THOSE WHO PREFER AN EDT, HERE'S OSCAR!_Many prefer a fragrance somewhat lighter than eau de parfum.  For those who do - here's Oscar!There are few who are not familiar with the name Oscar de la Renta.  He is a fashion designer known throughout the world not only for his couture collections but also for his philanthropic endeavors.Since beginning his own company in 1965 de la Renta has impacted the design of accessories, jewelry, handbags, scarves, shoes, furniture, and fragrances.Oscar, his initial perfume offering was introduced in 1977, and now is a popular seller throughout the world.  In addition, it is the winner of the 1991 Fragrance Foundation Success Award.More importantly to us, the scent is unforgettable.  Floral with a hint of Oriental it is a lovely blend of jasmine, basil, lavender, and sandalwood.It's romantic,and memorable.  Enjoy."
5730,1,"Great Natural Spray-On Sunscreen!_We were so excited to find the All Terrain sunscreen spray on Amazon- its hard to find in stores! We read about it on one of the EWG websites and decided to give it a try. It took a while for it to arrive but was really worth the wait. Just spray it on and it rubs right in. It is a little greasy, so make sure to have hand wipes around if you are out and about to clean it off (and don't get it on clothes). My kids are both impatient and very fair-skinned so this was perfect for our hot, sunny, Mid-Atlantic outdoor play. It really does last a long time and did not come off in the pool. Its a bit on the pricy side, but a lot of the 'natural' or 'organic' sun blocks usually are since they are not as common. The smell is not bad either, kind of neutral.Get it while it lasts since its really, really hard to find in stores..."
8916,0,"Don't buy, cute color but ughh_I saw this color and it looked beautiful, a very orange coral type color!!! But once you put it on it's like matte.... In a bad way ! It doesn't have the shine and beauty as other Essie nail polish have!! Very dissapointed"
2605,1,Love this conditioner_keeps my hair completely moisturized. there's just one thing... I NEED A BIGGER BOTTLE! I have a lot of hair and I go through this really fast. I have to buy this product like two or three bottles at a time.
1374,1,Love this! Helps with my dermatitis without breakouts!_I have stopped the daily use of my dermititis prescription cream as a direct result of using this lotion daily on my face along with washing my face twice a day with ZNP bar. (Sadly ZNP is now discontinued so hope to find great replacement - currently trying Noble Formula)I'm prone to breakouts as well and have found that this lotion when used in moderation does not cause me to break out either!  Thank goodness!!!So I'm thrilled with this lotion!  Next time I purchase I will try the version with sunscreen though and hope it works just as well.NO SCENT to this lotion - another huge plus!
7432,1,"Nice Shampoo, not really volumizing though._This shampoo has a nice light scent and a pretty lavender color.  The ingredients are a mix of healthy ingredients and conventional ones.  I have long hair so it is hard to give it volume because of the weight, but I didn't think this one particularly did much for my hair.  Towards the middle of the day I think mine started to get oily, which is a problem I have, but it was compounded by this shampoo I do believe.  In sum, this shampoo is okay but not great."
5179,1,Best Brow Product I Have Ever Used_Out of all the different brand brow gels and waxes. This is by far...way far...the best and the most easy to use.
3855,0,Barely shows up_I have olive skin (Indian descent) and this product barely shows up. I tossed it after trying to get some use out of it.
6229,1,The white is fantastic!_The white is soft enough for comfortable and effective waterline application. It is not irritating and it goes on so smooth and perfect!
7262,1,"nice brush_nice brush, blends your powders well onto the face but not used for liquid foundations or creams the bristles are too long to use for those types but if using a foundation powder or finishing power and or translucent powder this is a pretty good brush to use for those things."
1248,1,"great body butter, but beware of the scent_I only saw a few complaints of the scent.. but my goodness, the Brazalian Nut scent is very irritating, I must admit. It smells like icing on a cake, a very highly sugary smell. I wasn't expecting it to smell THAT strong.. however, it's still an amazing product. It really works into the skin. I just wouldn't buy the Brazilian Nut one ever again. I think my nose is even a little stuffed from smelling it so much LOL! Just a little warning.."
104,1,"One of my beauty secrets.._I am almost 33 but people says i look 20 something... They also thought I am still single but I told them I even have a 2 year old daughter! I used this product for 4 years already and until now I am amazed by how it works in my skin. It became smoother, tight and pore less. I love this with spf 15, not only it hydrates the skin but protects as well. This is really my beauty secret for looking young... I eat food so much, drink soda more than water but my skin still radiates plus the help of vitamins i take...So i really thank  olay total effects so much!"
887,1,Better than Salon Brand_I'd recently gotten my hair colored with an 'unnatural' red (as my stylist called it). It's a color I've had issues with fading in the past. I purchased a small sample of a salon brand color shampoo & conditioner in hopes that it would help prevent the fast fade. It didn't. I was fading just as quick as before and I really didn't want to spend more time in the chair to get it touched up. I switched to this Dove product and the fade stopped and the color has held and hasn't faded any further. I'll definitely continue to use this on my color-treated hair.
1864,1,love this_very light cologne  clean and masculine  perfect for warm weather months.  the bottle is very cool also.  this price was way cheaper than at macys
7479,1,"Smells so good!_I need to wash my hair daily because it tends to get oily, and when I used it daily it worked great.  I decided to give it a day in between washes to see how this product would hold up, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I didn't need it daily after all!  My hair was still nice and fresh on that in between day.  I think I will continue using this conditioner on a regular basis now.I love the smell, too!  It smells so good.  Not overpoweringly so, either.  The container is essentially upside down, with the lid on the bottom.  I really liked this because I feel I'm getting every last drop out of it.It moisturizes well and my usually hard to comb wet hair combed nice and smoothly.  I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great product at a decent price."
9603,1,"Makes my hair feel and look so healthy!_I have loved this product.  I am always so skeptical of new hair products claiming to do this and that, and so did not have high hopes.  However, this product claims to be activated by heat and it is the truth!  After using this product in the shower, and then using a hot blow dryer and then a straightener, my hair felt incredibly smooth and soft.  This is usually not the case and I try to avoid using too much heat.  What is great is that this conditioner claims also to work through three washes and I have had success with that as well.  This allows me to go through the product more slowly."
1190,1,Mod about you_This is a bright pale pink polish. Great for tanned skin but not my Casper white skin. Red head with freckles here. I use it for accent nail art. Great polish!
9769,1,"I really like it_I am really a fan of this item, feel like it works, I will be buying more."
1349,1,Keeps nails nice and buffed_Purchased this along with a chamois buffer and it keeps my nails nice and clean looking.  Very easy to use and does exactly what I wanted.
9788,1,"My Favorite NEW Beauty Product..._I had never used anything like this before, just your basic facial cleanser. I gotta say this is good stuff. I use it about once a week, and I have noticed a difference in my skin. I have far less break outs, and my skin feels soft and smooth.It goes on smooth and thick, and rinses of just ask easy. It doesn't leave your face feeling gritty, dry or oily. There is no way I would pay $120 for a facial, when this bottle, that runs about $30 works great. This Dead Sea Mud Mask contains 30 Treatments which lasts for 3-4 months (that is only $1 per treatment) , and if you just use for spot treatments, it will last you even longer.The packaging is great, the item arrived in great condition and the shipping was fast, I received it in just a few days.This is my new beauty product for life."
1855,1,"Nice scent but a little bit different than I expected_I generally like flowery scents, so when I read the product description, I thought I might like this perfume. It was offered as the goldbox deal, so I surrendered to temptation. I must say that this is more of a spicy scent than a flowery scent. The fragrance notes reads: Tahitian Tiare, Gardenia, Amber, Marshmallow, 'Sea Breeze' accord, Patchouli, Moroccan incense. I must say that I smell more of amber and Moroccan incense than anything else. Don't get me wrong, it is still a nice scent. If I were to choose a reference to define the scent, I would say that it reminds of bath & body works' rather spicier scents like sensual amber.I find the bottle and the overall representation a little bit childish, but it's just me!"
5901,1,"My Favorite!_Best straightener I've ever used. Requires less heat to straighten my kinky, frizzy hair than other flat irons. Doesn't dry out or kill my hair."
4710,1,"CUTE, SOFT, AND EFFECTIVE BRUSH!_I use this for my blush, powder, and buffing, definitely gives an airbrush finish and leaves my make-up looking flawless. The teddy bear hairs it has are SUPER SOFT, I recommend anyone who is just starting make up like me, or is a professional to have this brush."
3321,0,very dry_I dont know why but it doesn't go along with my foundation.Hard to apply just feels very dry and i don't know how much should i blend itcuz it won't cover too much if i blend
769,1,"Nice Lather_I really do like the feel of this body wash. It lathers well and one generous dollop is enough for my whole body in the shower -- with the exception of my face, on which I use a facial wash. I'm not too crazy about the smell, though, and I understand that perfumes can cause problems. I would just like to have the option to buy other fragrances. The bottle is very hard and thick and it does get difficult to squeeze out the product. It helps to reform the bottle and make sure it has air in it. It will not stand on its top and, since the tip is so small, it doesn't even lean well. That being said, the top is easy to open in the shower.My skin does feel smoother and less dry when I use the product.It's a pretty good price compared to other body washes."
1222,0,"Did not work for me_This product is expensive and it isn't all that high in quality, to be honest. It didn't work very well for me. The wash was slimy and the moisturizer was greasy. It didn't dry my skin out, but it really seemed to clog my pores."
8471,1,"Perfect for the gym bag_I usually work out at lunchtime, and so I generally keep one of these in my gym bag at all times.  I really like Axe.  At home I usually use separate shampoo and conditioners, but at the gym, I want to carry a single bottle, so this is a great compromise.  This particular Axe has a really nice smell.  The closest thing I can think of to it would be a scent like vanilla.  It's clean and smooth, rather than some of the much 'spiceier' smells that many of the Axe products have.Another bonus is that these bottles are heavy duty, last a long time, and don't come open in my bag.  Highly recommended for this use."
3335,1,"Incredible products from John Frieda_This detangler is excellent. I used it in combination with the strength restoring lotion and my hair feels light, free, incredibly nourished without being weighed down. All the products I used in this root awakening line smell incredible, too, and feel great going on and feel great once your hair is dry. Really happy I found this line..."
5338,0,"$6?_Why are you charging $6 for this shadow when people can get it on the Elf site for $1 or $3?.  Everyone, Google elf cosmetics and see what you come up with.  If you just google elf you will go onto a site for lubricants.  Google elf cosmetics.  Have fun!"
8966,1,"About as safe as sun block can get._Technically, this product is a sun block because it uses a barrier method of sun protection with titanium dioxide as the active ingredient. It's very creamy to the point of being oily, so it's easy to apply. At least it doesn't leave a white kabuki-mask-like residue like some brands, hah!The product doesn't have any added fragrance; however, it contains a scent - perhaps this is due to all the plant-based extracts in it. It was a bit strong for me, but I have an excessively sensitive nose. Since it'll be used outside, I doubt the scent will bother anyone.Like all sunscreens and sun blocks, the product should be reapplied often. It seems to work well as no one suffered sun damage, but it's probably the most expensive sun block I've ever used."
9158,1,Super cute!_The expected delivery date came and went. I contacted the seller who got back with me right away and offered to reship or refund my money. I requested a reshipment and am so glad I did. The headband is just adorable and I get compliments on it all the time. the elastic is very comfortable and it stays in place all day. Just love it!
6610,1,"cant live without it_This product is wonderful. I use it everyday..it works and will be repurchased.A bit expensive, but does just what it's suppose to."
8556,1,Love them!_Color is very deep & rich. Only one coat required - best holo polish I've seen. Great for stamping too!
7550,1,"I like this color_I like this color. I bought it as a dupe for Chanel's Peridot. Currently enjoying it on my toes. However, the boyfriend hates it. Too bad. I am still going to enjoy it!!!"
2304,0,"No matter what your color is, this isn't good :-(_I actually sell Revlon where I work, yet it's not my favourite.  I got testers of this stock in today, and gave them a go and you need to really coat it on before you see the color appear.  That is after you try and get the silly lid off, and after you almost shake your arm off trying to get some or any of the powder into the cup that the brush dips into.I have tried (and love) Bare Minerals and the Loreal brands and they are top notch.  This however, is a very poor copy and I wouldn't waste your time or money on it.  It's too frustrating to use, and you'd take forever to apply it to your skin to get any kind of decent coverage.  Sorry, I cannot recommend this at all."
7312,1,"husband loves it_My husband is super picky about shampoo and he really likes this one!  He usually ends up using my shampoo because he doesn't like the standard Head & Shoulders, etc.  So I'm glad we found one that he likes - rather than using my  more expensive shampoo for color treated hair!"
2113,1,LOVE IT_I have recommended this product to many friends.  The tint in the cream is really nice for just going outside and gardening.  Keeps those dark spots from getting darker in the sun.  LOVE IT
7977,1,"The real deal_I love this Hyaluronic acid because it is real.  I've purchased others and the consistency was just a bit off, and I honestly didn't notice any difference in my skin except that it felt dry.  I really notice my skin feels softer and smoother, and moisturized after I use the Cosmedica brand serum.  I will continue to use the Cosmedica brand of Hyaluronic acid serum."
6496,1,"Good Value_Received this item on time and the price was good. Great set of brushes. I like the compact style, takes up less room. Good for traveling or toting in your purse. Very soft brushes, not scratchy."
470,0,Peeled my skin off_This stuff is TOO STRONG!! It peeled my skin within 2weeks of using. I would not recommend this product for use!!
377,0,"Not worth the money_After years of hearing this blush hailed as the ultimate color - I bought it. The color is beautiful - but the longevity is nonexistent!! The pigmentation was NOT good, after a few hours it travels and disappears. I have dry skin, so traveling makeup should NOT be an issue, but this was. The only way I could get it to stay was to put cream blush on underneath and layer it over it, which of course changes the color. Shouldn't have to do that for the hefty price, IMO. I would not recommend it to anyone. The second star is for the color, which - in theory - is perfect. But overall: this stuff is literally Wet -n wild quality..."
4077,1,"maybellin primer_its a great primer, I wish it would be biggerbur it gives a great surface tu the skinthis line of maybelline its really good"
6994,1,"I like although haven't used them yet but so we shall see_They have some fall out but if you brush them against your hand the loose bristles will start up poke up & I'm sure after they get washed the fall out will be gone....hopefully. There are alot of synthetic brushes which I didnt realize but I needed more concealer brushes so they will get used for concealers, primers, bases, highlighting with gel & cream makeup. The other makeup brushes feel like sable and they have good thickness to them. So they will pick up alot of products. I may have to order another brush kit to get more regular brushes. Overall im happy with it. There was no weird smell to them like some people say. I will write another review once I use them for while."
7390,1,"Beautiful curls with a drawback_I've had my Hot Tools 1.5 inch barrel iron for about 15 years now and thought it would be nice to try a different look.  A friend of mine has recommended her styling wand but I know that hers is a smaller barrel that is tapered at the end.  I thought what the heck, why not try it?Pros: I LOVED the curls and the look that I had once finished.  They were smooth and made me think 'beachy.'Cons: It takes a lot longer than my normal curling iron.  My hair is down to the back of my bra strap so I have to take small clumps of hair to make it all the way to the bottom of the barrel without overlapping.  This makes for a much longer process.  Also, the glove sucks!  You can't hold onto your hair on the barrel without feeling some pain.  This means you are more often than not with `unfinished' looking ends since you can only hold on for several seconds until you feel a burn.  Last, your arms will be tired since this is a two arm process.  I've noticed it's much easier doing my daughters hair than doing my own hair. I like to consider my arms toned but they get tired holding onto the tip of my hair in one hand and the wand in the other.When I think about this curling wand I think back to the 1800s when they probably had some cast iron curling wand sitting on the stove heating up then trying not to burn their hands or hair with it.  How many times have I had a clamp mark with a standard curling iron the last 15 years?  Not as many times as I've had `unfinished' looking ends the last two weeks using the wand.  I think I will stick with my standard curling iron for everyday use and break out the Remington wand for days that I'm looking for a beachy wave."
3090,1,Good_This brush are so helpful when I make manicure very easy to usewell made have good quality material so far work ok
4306,0,Did nothing_I had heard so much about this stuff I had high hopes and really wanted to try it. I broke out a little but that was it. No big change  in rinkes in fact no change at all.
741,1,Very Happy_This hairdryer works perfectly and is easy to use. It looks nice and I have had no problems with it.
6115,1,GREAT BUY!_If you have girls that like to do nail's this is a great thing for them to have. I have two teenage gilrs and they love doing nail's and there is so many of them if they dont like the way it looks no worries there is plenty more. GREAT BUY!
6423,1,"For all you people leaving 'BOGUS REVIEWS' comments_WOW! For everyone who has left a review, or is going to, if you did not try this product DO NOT LEAVE A REVIEW, PERIOD! You are all doing EXACTLY what you are accusing other people doing: writing bogus reviews. You are getting SO MAD that people are wrongly giving this product 5 stars for not even trying it (when you don't even know if they actually tried it in the first place!), when YOU are wrongly giving 1 star for not even trying it. Quit being hypocrites! If you did not try this product, do not write about it. That being said, my mother and I both bought this product to try it out, knowing that if we didn't like it and it didn't work like all these people are saying it wont, we could return it. Sure enough, I loved it, as did my mom. Now obviously it wont work for everyone, because no one product will ever work for everyone, but both of us liked it. So now that I know this product will work great for people, it really pisses me off that all these people are on here bashing this product that they never tried and trying to get people to not buy it. If you have such a huge problem about reviews people are writing, contact amazon!!!!"
8762,1,"Good_This hair product is actually very effective, especially on African-American hair. It left the hair tamed, flowing, and wonderful!  I highly recommend it."
5702,1,Very good_Very good lip glosses eyeshadow mascara. I love the quality and it stays on all day and all night I might even buy another
6223,1,amazing_it's so pigmrneted. it is chap it last about two hours and i love that is  matte. the only downside is that is dry and i have to put a lip balm first
7687,1,"Lovely scent_This smells lovely!  I have very sensitive skin and this didn't bother me. Also, it cleaned about as good as what I have been using, which is a more expensive product.  I will definitely buy this again as the price is excellent."

8093,1,"IT'S A TOSSUP BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR STARS_BANANA BOAT SPORT COOLZONE SUNCREEN LOTION, SIX OZ, is a great travel size, though small in size for the price. The sides have notches to help with slippery hands, which is great. The scent isn't anything to write home about, to say the least. One thing I love about suntan lotion is its coconut fragrant, which is not the case with this product. I love that it stands upside down, allowing easy application, even when it's nearly empty. It goes on smooth, absorbing quickly, and not leaving a greasy feeling.Aside from the smell and price for the quantity, it's a great product.Product description (Of the three, I'd have to say only the last is true.):* Instantly cools and refreshes* Refreshing, clean scent* Non greasy and fast absorbing"

So amazing that you get all this for such a low price, with this stamper you will never run out of fun designs!!Shany Stamping Nail Art Set (Nail Art Image Plate Holder, Scraper, Stamper)So have fun and Stamp Away!!!"
1543,1,"Excellent, doesn't smear of clump_Gentle on your eyes, it doesn't smear or clump or give you coon eyes. It stays on literally all day. It will not come off, or clump at all. And even when you try to take it off or wash it off at night, it doesn't smear off like eyes crying in the rain, it comes off easy. Best mascara I've ever tried. Far, far, better than Physician's Formula mascara, is this one by Reviva."
8108,1,"I Luv Make-up_If you are a Diva that loves make-up lke me then you will love this product.  The darker side is PERFECT for highlighting under the cheekbones, chin & forehead. It is very light...just dap a tiny bit onto brush and blen away.I recommend you get this product and don't spend too much on any other highlighter. It makes a great cut to my cheekbones."
7277,1,"Best exfoliating cloth on the market_I started using these in Korea when I lived there for several years, and these are the only ones I could find that were comparable and washable.  I really like them, and will continue to use them because they are well-made and do the job they are supposed to!"
5342,1,Nice product_I thought it would be a little bigger when it came in however it's a good product and looks great!
819,1,"Manly Scent_Purchased this scent as a gift for my 28 year-old brother. Smells divine on him! Women ask him all the time what he's wearing ... and of course, the name BULGARI means it's expensive. This scent is strong though -- very manly and commanding. I know that fragrances smell different on each person due to different body chemistry. I recommend trying it first before purchasing a full size one. I am purchasing one for my husband, too, fortunately, it also smells divine on him."
340,1,I'll never use a loofah again_I discovered the benefits of using an exfoliating towel while reading a health magazine.  I bought one to try and returned to Amazon to buy 4 more to give to  my husband and sons. I love how clean and healthy my skin looks after showering or bathing using this towel.
3021,1,"Maybe she's born with flawless undereyes....MAYBE IT'S MAYBELLINE!_This concealer and highlighter duo does the job and it does it well. It's so convenient that they included a highlighter color as well for an extra pop when applied under the eyes. It is a creamy formula and does not sink into my fine lines under my eyes. It has two different brushes, a spongy one for the concealer and a normal stranded brush for the highlighter. It's a nice portable size also. It conceals so well, I'll definitely be repurchasing!"
7866,1,"pretty_I like all the options you get with this kit. You can play it up and have really off the wall dramatic eyes if you wanted to, not many cosmetic companies make kits like that that are actually worth paying for."
6483,1,"This Simple Smoothing Facial Tone  is an excellent choice for those with sensitive skin ..._Before using the Simple Soothing Facial Toner, I used theSimple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel.  If you want to exfoliate or scrub you might consider using theSimple Smoothing Facial Scrubinstead.  My skin isn't as sensitive and prone to outbreaks as some people's, however I do like to stay away from using any harsh chemicals.  I definitely liked the entire 'experience' of using the Simple line of products.First I used the Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel, then the Simple Soothing Facial Toner, and then moisturized. After any facial treatment, you'll want to use a moisturizer to prevent your skin from drying out.  If you want to stay with the same product line, theSimple Replenishing Rich Moisturizeris now an Add-on item.  There are several positive things about the Simple line that are very appealing to me, especially the lack of harsh chemicals.~  Simple Smoothing Facial Toner has vitamin B-5 which 'helps restore, soften and smooth' and vitamin E moisturizer which 'helps improve skin condition.'~  It has chamomile which is  known to help gently soften and soothe the skin.~  It has witch hazel which is  known to help tone and tighten pores.~  It has allantoin, an ingredient that helps alleviate skin discomfort.~  NO perfume, NO dyes, NO harsh irritants.~  It has been tested by dermatologists.~  It's  Noncomedogenic (it doesn't clog the pores of the skin).~  It's hypoallergenic.INGREDIENTS:Water (Aqua, Eau), Sorbitol, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark/Leaf/Twig Extract, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Allantoin, Sodium PCA, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Propylen Glycol, 2-Bromo-2-Nitropropane-1, 3-Diol, MethylparabenWHAT ARE THESE INGREDIENTS?Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5):  Ingredient that helps restore, soften and smooth skin.Propylene Glycol (Humectant):  Ingredient that attracts water to hydrate the skin.Methylparaben (Preservative):  Ingredient that helps to inhibit the development of micro-organisms.Sorbitol (Skin Conditioner:  Ingredient used to enhance the appearance of skin.Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract (Emollient):  Ingredient that works on skin's surface to give it a soft and smooth texture.Allantoin (Soothing agent):  Ingredient that helps alleviate skin discomfort.Sodium PCA (Humectant):  Ingredient that attracts water to hydrate the skin.Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate (Surfactant):  Ingredient that is added to cosmetic products to clean or remove dirt and oil from the skin.2-Bromo-2-Nitropropane-1,3-Diol (Preservative):  Ingredient that helps to inhibit the development of micro-organisms."
1559,1,"Essential to me_I have fair skin. So fair that the area under my eyes look like I have a couple of shiners or am undergoing a horrible cancer treatment. I started using concealer, usually Cover Girl, when I hit Junior High. I even take it on camping trips. This is a good concealer."
7729,1,"Ultima Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Acid Serum-YAY_Yes, I like this stuff!  It feels very nice on the face, and all I use is 2 drops in the morning under my moisturizer or moisturizer/foundation depending on the time of year or activity.  I have noticed a decrease in the appearance of fine lines around my eyes.  This is the very first product I have ever been able to say that about.  The question is....if I stop using it, will they return?"
2725,1,"Best primer!_I have very oily skin with a long history of acne, and as a result my pores are gigantic. I've tried many, many, foundation primers over the years to control oil and fill in my pores so my foundation won't pool in them but they have all either made me more oily, broken me out, or both. I'm talking dozens of primers both high end and low. This one is the only one that works for me. It really does help control oil, but more importantly it completely smooths out my huge pores and makes my foundation look flawless. I've always had bad skin and I can tell you that every single time I've received a compliment on my complexion, I have been using this product. It just doesn't happen without it! The trick is to using the tiniest bit, smoothing it over the areas you need to prime, and letting it set for a few minutes before applying your foundation. I'm not the biggest Avon fan but this product is fantastic."
8252,0,"Never again..._I really wanted to try this product for quite sometime and was so looking forward to having it and seeing the effects. I was sadly disappointed. I wasn't even able to use it long enough to see any type of effects to be honest. It all came down to the ickyness it left on my face. I use a small amount (less than dime size) and spread it evenly all over my face, circulating it throughout. Within a few minutes I felt like I had greasy stuff on my forehead. When I looked in the mirror I looked like a shiny Christmas ornament. Now that wouldn't be such a big deal because it IS a nighttime treatment after all so no one is going to see you like that out in public. The problem is it actually left residue on my pillow! On top of that I had an itch on my cheek and when I scratched I came away with gunk on my finger! Ew is all I can say. I couldn't get past a third night of using this."
2422,0,"Nothing to write home about_I don't think this conditioner is particularly moisturizing, unfortunately.  I have been using this for about two and a half weeks, and my hair actually feels worse than it did (note: I didn't change anything else in my haircare regimen) before, when I used Asience and Pantene.  My hair isn't particularly smooth or silky (though it's not like it ruined my hair or anything), and my hair gets tangled a little more easily than usual :/.The good things about this conditioner are its price/quantity.  As I said, I have been using the conditioner for over two weeks, while most only last me two weeks max.  Also, a friend of mine also uses this, and she has had better results; her hair is softer and silkier, and our best guess is because she has thinner hair, so that might be something to take into consideration."
3981,0,"Deceiving color pictured_It is TIffany Teal-ish. Not Minty Green...bummer!If you live by a Target or Rite Aid, check their colors first.  It is a better price on this site but I will always check it before I buy it online from now on."
9151,1,"It Helps._I bought this product because I thought I would give it a try.  I know that it is not going to completely get rid of any bumps or uneven skin problems I have, but I figured I would give it a try.  I am happy to say that I am very impressed with the results.  This product has definitely helped my cellulite.  It does not make it go away, but what it does it kinda smooth it out.  The cream kinda plumps the skin so the cellulite is less visible, at least that is what I am noticing.  I am sure every one will get different results, but for me this is the results I am getting and I am happy with it."
1013,1,"Just AMAZING!!!!! Vive le Savon de Marseille_This is the best soap I have ever used. I use it on my skin and hair. They feel so soft and smooth after each shower. My hair is very silky. It feels like I just used conditioner. I have never seen a soap to do that to my hair. Also, my skin has never been pampered like this before. After washing it with this soap, it is so smooth. You don't need to use body lotion after taking a shower. It's so incredible the quality of this soap.Some people complain about the smell of this soap, but I love it. It is a natural smell. Everything about this soap is A+. I am glad I discovered it and I will use it from now on.I bought the 1000 g one and is very easy to cut into manageable pieces.This is a great investment and your body and hair will look and feel  just gorgeous!!!"
9430,1,"Perfect solution for brassiness_After a frantic out-of-the box coloring mess, I found this product to help with the brassiness left behind. I was desperate so I gave it a try and am I ever glad that I did! This worked great for my hair. I have a natural redness/golden blonde that can ruin a good dye job so this helps rein it in. It wears off after about 10 days for me so that's another reason I love the fact you get about 6 uses out of the bottle. It really makes my hair look healthy and shiny without being greasy. It's a high quality product!"
1231,1,"Love this shampoo set!_The set is marvelous for my very long thick hair. It is the only product that tames my thick frizzy hair. Most of the time, I do not even need tostraighten my hair because of this product. I highly recommend it. My daughter loves it too."
2652,1,"My hubby says..._My hubby says he wishes that there was a real fruit that smells like this! That should give you an idea of how great love spell is. It is sweet, tart, and refreshing. I feel happy when I wear this to sleep and wake up smelling it on my skin. Pair it with the lotion and the scent will last half a day...and usually fragrances, even perfumes, have zero staying power on my skin.Pro:Hands down the sweetest yet most refreshing scent of all time! Lasts a long time when worn with lotion or cream. Very wearable and fit for all ocassions. Their other scents are either sickly sweet (the word is saccharin I believe) like Pure Seduction, or hecka serious like something your hot 3rd grade teacher would wear, like secret charm.Cons:There is a problem with such a great scent...and it is by no means the product's fault...which is....EVERYONE wears this!!! Seriously, I do not know a pretty girl who does not own a bottle of love spell. I get random whiffs of this at the mall, at restaurants, movie theaters, wherever. Then I come home and smell more of it on myself. Granted, it is difficult to get sick or annoyed by this fragrance, but due to it's immense popularity I believe the product now has less personality. You know what I mean? It is impossible to make a scent 'yours' when everyone and their mom wears it. Of course, I cannot take a star away from a product just because it is popular. But if you want something of your own, better look for another scent. They actually have lots of great scents for different personalities. Go to the store and try all of it. That was what I did.Another thing...I do not recommend buying Victorias secret body care online. You need to smell it to make sure you love it. A bottle of lotion or spray lasts a long time, and you don't want to be stuck with some annoying scent. Also, they always, always have sales in store. You are likely to get this a lot cheaper. Last time I checked it was 7 for 40 bucks.Over all, great scent, hubby loved it, and that's all it matters :)Thanks for reading and hope this helped!"
6419,1,holders_this was a pretty quick delivery. works great you dont have to worry about the polish spilling all over. great idea
9828,1,Date night revitalized_Got this for my wife becuase we have been slacking on date nights. She hates putting on makeup but refused to go to nice restaurants without going the full 9 yards. Got her this mostly to prove a point but after she used this last night and started going on and on about it today I decided I should jump on here and write a review to let others know it works well and is a great value. Exact quote: &#34;Takes the work out of cleaning off eye shadow.&#34;
5415,1,"Love this product!_The color appears kinda orange, but when you rub it into the skin it looks better than first thought. Love this product, it stays on your skin and does not melt away (and I have oily t-zone.) I have used my hands & UD brush, whichever is easier, both work. I also use Too Faced Amazing Face powder which is really great too!! Give this product a try!!! Love it!!"
8300,1,"Great conditioner_This conditioner is nice and thick. It is not watered down and runny. It left my hair feeling soft and well conditioned, probably because one of the main ingredients is a silicone. I have curly, colored hair and I like silicone based products so this conditioner worked well for me.  It has a perfumey kind of scent but it was not too overpowering."
9787,1,"Great Mask for once a week cleansing!_I received this mask to try out, and it is amazing! I wrote a review on my blog stating how good this mask is for anyone who wants to feel refreshed after wearing it.This isn't one of those constraining masks either. If you don't know what I'm talking about try out Freeman's facial masks. Those always tighten up, and I can't smile, or even say anything, this mask on the other hand is like the Body Shop's tea tree mask. The thing I love about this mask is that it comes in a big squeeze tube bottle, so you have enough to last you a while. I haven't even used up a third of this mask.The mask does smell slightly of aloe vera, but it's really faint. Overall I would recommend this mask to anyone who wants a relaxing hour or so!"
4321,1,"Great mascara for a great value_If you are looking for a mascara that makes your eyes look huge, doesn't clump, comes off easily, and is cheap... Give this mascara a try! In my opinion, best drugstore mascara out there."
7155,1,"No Breakouts so far_I've used this sunscreen when I'm outside doing yard work and it had worked wonderfully.  It goes on smooth, and does not leave any greasy feeling to my face.  I haven't had any acne breakouts from using it, or any irritation.  I'm Asian and have fair colored skin.  When I don't use sunscreen, I get red fast and get sunburned easily.  SPF 40 did the job, and I did not get sunburned in 90 degree heat working on my yard for 2 hours.  I find it does it's job well, but might be a bit cost prohibitive to some.  It's definitely more expensive than most sunscreens, but feels a lot nicer than the cheap stuff. Give it a try.  I recommend it."
3902,1,"AWESOME!!!_I LOVE Shany products by its price-value relation. They offers GREAT quality for a very low price.This palette has matte, bright and some shimmery colors, the size of the shadows is small but I think it's ok.If you use a good primer, the colors are REALLY bright and last ALL DAY.I REALLY buy it again... and again... and AGAIN!"
5431,1,"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MASCARA!_I really LOVE this mascara! It makes my lashes long, and thick. It is quite black in the carbon shade, which I love!  Two coats and you are good to go!  I also like that the formula is more wet than many mascara's I have used , I like a more glossy look. It dries fast and does no clump or smudge.  What a great drugstore mascara!"
2332,1,"Good for curly, frizzy hair_I use this with my Herstyler flat iron, and it makes my curly hair super straight. The bottle it cute and comes with a little plastic charm. The bottle doesn't come EXACTLY like in the picture, it's slightly different. The scent smells fruity and sweet, it's not the best smell but after I'm done flat ironing, it goes away. My straight hair lasts all day with out poofing or going crazy. I really like that it gets rid of all my frizzyness. I also love to use this after I shower on 80% dry hair. It keeps my curly hair from frizzing and makes it kind of wavy."
1441,1,"First pregnancy_This is my first baby and I decided to try this oil with the cream and I love it! Both absorb into the skin quickly and they are not greasy or leave streaks in your clothes.  I would recommend this product, so far so good!"
239,1,Smells Good_This is a great smelling perfume oil.  I cannot describe the scent other than to say it stays close to the skin and is very sexy.  This particular line of products are all wonderful.
9896,1,Love it!_I already tried the Face Mask and the Soap and so I was not surprised that I loved the shampoo as well. Don't be fooled by the dark color of the Shampoo! It does not foam dark- it lathers completely into a white foam and you need only a tiny bit of it. The Shampoo and the Conditioner both have a pleasant mild fresh scent- not overwhelming- just clean and nice. BTW: I recommend using also the conditioner: The conditioner really makes my hair shiny and hydrated. I am dandruff free at the moment so this will be my new anti dandruff solution. I love that it is a natural and cruelty free product. I recommend this.
632,1,"Love love LOVE this eyelash curler_I've used this heated eyelash curler for 4 years, & recently lost the brush on it & was delighted to find a new one available on Amazon.com!  After decades of using the old 'pinch style' eyelash curlers - I found the Panasonic Heated Curler and was amazed at what a huge difference it made in the health & appearance of my lashes.  They grew longer, and thicker (could this be due to the gentle heat?).  And the Panasonic never 'yanks them out' like the old fashioned curler.  I just hope that Amazon continues to have the Panasonic Heated curler available for the next tine I lose mine!!"
9683,1,"Leaves hair clean and not weighed down_I find cosmetic companies' advertising claims to be meaningless hype, and &#34;oxygen fused ingredients&#34; (what does that even mean?) is no exception.  BUT I do like a few things about this shampoo and one of them is that it leaves my hair very clean.  I'm middle-aged, with dry hair and skin, so I try to shampoo only every other day instead of daily.  With some shampoos my hair is flat or limp or greasy by day 2 but with this Dove it still looks clean the second day.  It works for me.THE GOOD:+ Very thick, so it doesn't run off of my hand or my head before I even start lathering... I feel this is less wasteful.+ Leaves my hair very clean and not limpTHE MEH:- Boring scent.  I like a little aromatherapy in my shower.BOTTOM LINE:  Not groundbreaking but I enjoy how clean and un-weighed-down it leaves my hair."
7443,1,Great!_My scalp gets dry because I shampoo a lot and this product really helps to reverse the damage.  It feels like it goes deep and lasts a long time.  My hair feels all around healthier after only just a few uses.  It smells great too!
7600,1,"Cuticle tools_These items arrived on time. very nice quality and would definitely order from this company again. Very well packaged for shipment. I haven't use them yet, but they're very heavy and well made. My husband looked at them and stated how well made they looked, and that he has a similar set in his garage. Great purchase!"
2627,1,"Soft, spongey but maybe a bit too soft!_I bought this sponge after going to a Korean spa where I got a fantastic body scrub. Of course, this sponge is hardly doing the work of what they did but I wanted something that wouldn't fall apart after a few uses and the reviews were very good! So far extremely durable, very nice on the skin, and very foamy and spongey. Perhaps I was thinking it might be slightly less soft but I love it - it is not supposed to a scrub, poor thing, it is doing what it is advertised to do and I give it a good rating! Thank you!"
5193,0,"Poor quality, started to tear on first use._I'm not impressed. These are very cheaply made, not worth the price. I used them just as instructed and a few of the guards started to tear as I was carefully, so I would not damage the bristles of my brushes, pushing the guards up towards them. Either I got a defective package of these, or they are simply poorly constructed of cheap materials. I suspect the latter. I will not be buying more."
1662,1,"The smell is intoxicating and it has helped my dry, flyaway hair._I had been using the same shampoo and conditioner for far too long...while I liked my old brand, my colored hair was feeling straw-like and needed a change. On my next visit to the drug store to pick up a prescription, I perused the shampoo aisle for something new. I found the Organix Nourishing Coconut Milk shampoo and matching conditioner. I LOVE the smell of coconut and the word 'nourishing' looked promising for my dry hair, so I figured I'd give it a try.With many shampoo/conditioner pairs, the consistency of both products is very similar. Not with this pair. The shampoo is thinner and the conditioner is super thick (I ADORE it, but more on that over in the conditioner review).The shampoo and conditioner both come in a rounded flip-top container. I must say that it isn't the most well-designed bottle for use in the shower with wet hands, but I generally don't have a problem picking up the shampoo bottle, flipping the lid and squeezing shampoo into my hand (the same unfortunately cannot be said for the conditioner, but more on that over in the conditioner review).The smell of both products is WONDERFUL (if you like the smell of coconut, which I do). Interestingly, while I am very fragrance sensitive when it comes to perfumey scents, I adore natural scents like coconut and vanilla, so while the coconut fragrance is very noticeable, it doesn't bother me at all.Finally, while my hair did not undergo any miraculous transformation, it is definitely NOT straw-like anymore and I'm not having the problems with flyaways that I was having before I switched to these products. I have a feeling that is more due to the conditioner than the shampoo, but who knows!"
3061,1,"Love the eye pads_My eyes get very tired from working in front of a computer all day, and this is just perfect at the end of the day."
9583,1,"Spray and Go_I like the idea of spray lotions and oils and while it is convenient to spray it on, you still have to rub it in with your hand. This dry oil spray is very moisturizing and made my skin glow, though. I love the look of it on bare legs instead of a more ashy lotion."
9816,1,"My Skin Drinks This Up!_First of all, I love Hyaluronic Acid - I take the capsules and have used it topically before, but never in a moisturizer that also contains Vitamin C (which is SO good for you!)  I was worried this moisturizer would be tacky on my skin (which is my product pet peeve), but this moisturizer went on so lightly and my skin absorbed it so fast, I was able to put my makeup on right over it. I've been using for about 3 weeks now and not only are the lines around my eyes plumped out, my entire face just feels healthier and firmer! I experienced no sensitivities at all and loved how quickly this was shipped!! Two thumbs up!!"
7168,0,"Awful_I can't imagine who this might work for!  The one and only time I tried this product, I had to shampoo it right out.  Luckily I had time that day or I would have had to wear a hat.  It made my hair look greasy even though I had just shampooed.  It was very heavy feeling in the hair and I only used a tiny amount since I don't like a lot of product on my hair."
7171,1,Cute_These are a great way to dress up your nails with out too much effort. They worked better on my toe nails because they dont bend very much.
8913,1,"Natural and great product._This is a very well priced, all natural product.  I really like how my hair behaves after using this.  Both shampoo and conditioner are a little on the thick side, but really it is like having a concentrate.... more for the money!  Just add water and lather."
3992,1,"Excellent daily skincare products_I really like this kit a lot! The price point is a good value for the amount of product that is included, unlike some of the competitor kits, this one has more than a months worth of product.The ScrubThe beads in the scrub are smooth enough for everyday use. The cream leaves your face feeling hydrated and not stripped. My skin felt and looked fresher after only a few days use!The MoisturizerThe dispenser is different, but I got used to it right away, and now I really like the design! The cream is SO silky! It feels amazing on your skin, and leaves your skin with a more matte finish, instead of a dewy look that other moisturizers leave. I really love this cream.The Eye CreamIt only takes a dot of this around each eye so it lasts a long time. There is a bit of sparkle to it which brightens your eyes. I don't really notice any difference in the way my eyes look after using the product, but I do think it is a good moisturizer for the sensitive area around the eyes."
7689,1,"Rich, Refreshing Cleanser_Over the years I've tried dozens of different types of cleansers.  My favorites are the exfoliating cleansers, and the best of the bunch in my opinion are the ones with microbeads.  This cleanser has a pearly, thick texture and feels very luxurious.  The microbeads are gentle, just as you'd expect. I'm rating this 4 stars instead of 5 because it does leave my skin feeling just a bit dry and tight (although I've yet to try a cleanser that doesn't do this).  This cleanser is hypo-allergenic and non-comedogenic, but it is fragranced.  The fragrance is not unpleasant at all but is stronger than the 'barely there' that I would prefer.  If you prefer fragrance-free products, you might want to steer clear of this one."
4823,1,"WAITED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW UNTIL AFTER READING MANY REVIEWERS, WEBSITES AND MONTHS OF TRIAL AND ERROR!_WAITED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW UNTIL AFTER READING MANY REVIEWERS, WEBSITES AND MONTHS OF TRIAL AND ERROR!I waited to write this review until I had tried MANY of the tips from MANY of the wonderful reviewers on Amazon.com!  Below is what has finally worked for me the best.  I have been doing my own nails for years .. when I heard how long gel nails lasted .. I was hooked!  I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks .. my manicure very nicely 2 weeks .. then I must start to 'tip' the ends with a matching regular nail polish.  If I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color .. it will last better.  My nails grow quickly so I really can't last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  Hope the below is helpful .. thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!AUGUST 2013  (SORRY IN ADVANCE THAT MY 'WORD' DOCUMENT CONVERTS SO BADLY TO AMAZON VIA THE SENTENCE STRUCTURES!)The motto for GEL is 'thin to win' - several very thin layers, no thick ones!Manicure & Pedicure Gelish ApplicationAUGUST 2013  The motto for GEL is 'thin to win' - several very thin layers, no thick ones.Manicure & Pedicure Gelish Application  [...]1. First remove old gel polish. Rough up nails well so acetone can get through. Then starting with the little finger and work to the thumb.  Soak pad of Hands Down with acetone.  Start with the short end of Hands Down ..  with the pad slightly off center.  Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. . This helps keep the pads moist longer.  Do the second hand.  Put a glove on the second hand and set the timer for 20 minutes after completing 2nd hand. With the gloves on, can do other tasks.  After 20 minutes, remove the glove and pull off the pads, one at a time .. starting with little finger-1st hand, flipping the polish off each nail with an orange stick as you go. If some sticks on the tips, a little pressure with an orange stick coated with acetone ought to make it release.  Pads can reused a couple of times before throwing away .. flick off old polish from pad/flatten/let dry/store separated in paper sheets they came in.  (Using: Graham Hands Down Soak Off Gel Nail Wraps-works GREAT! -for small toenails the pad can be cut in half for double usage!)  2.  Apply cuticle remover .. push back the cuticle.  3.  Remove cuticle from nail plate.  Clean up as needed.  4.  Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.  5.  Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.  6.  Remove the dust and clean the nail.  .  (IF POSSIBLE:  apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  Leave on overnight if possible. Then:  wash with soap and water and polish using the proper steps.  7.  Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  Use an orange stick to fully clean around cuticles with the alcohol. You don't want any kind of oil on the nails.  8. Apply  PH Bond to the nail plate. (or skip if you used alcohol if you choose) APPLY SPARINGLY - i.e. very thin coat!  (Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it's thin enough.) .  9. SKIP TO #12 IF nails are not peeling/brittle/weak/damaged.  If you have normal nails just using Foundation Gel  as your base.  **Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail. If needed apply 2 thin layers of the Gelish strengthener.  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  10.  Apply  NAIL STRENGHTENER RECOVERY-gold bottle for added strength and that takes care of most problems.) Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails!)  If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  Place hand in the LED Light for 10 seconds.  10b NEXT  .. 'STRUCTURE GEL.  NOTE:  dot a small amount of base coat on each nail with the brush. Then, wipe the rest of the gel off of the brush. Use the mostly dry brush to spread the small amount of product on your nail. I even wipe the brush off between each nail. This ensures a thin layer OR WILL PEEL!  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds. (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails but Structure Gel is a wonderful strong product!.)  11. If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  DO NOT USE CLEANSER... this is a DRY cleaning.  12.  Apply Gelish Color Coat of Choice. First, seal the free edge of the nail. Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer. APPLICATION SHOULD BE ALMOST SEE-THROUGH ON 1st COAT!  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds (30 seconds for light colors).  (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  13.  Repeat Step 11, 12 & 13 for 2nd color coat.  14.  Apply Gelish Top Coat (GELISH TOP IT OFF GEL SEALER). First seal the free edge. Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION. If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  Place hand in LED Light for 20 seconds.  (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  15.  Wipe off the tacky surface residue with NAIL PREP (or alcohol) using a lint free wipe.  16.  Use cuticle oil nightly  as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.TIPS:  a.  I find it better to complete one step .. including the LED light .. with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED light.  b.  I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  I do this as I go as it is easier to do while wet .. IMPOSSIBLE after the LED light!c.  Peeling: If you have tried thinner layers, and upping your cure time (try 1 min extra for UV, 30 sec extra  for LED) isn't working, consider blaming your foundation coat formula, this was the culprit in my second  Gelish kit.d.  By searching and finally finding a regular nail polish (Sally Hansen '#350 Heart to Heart' Diamond Strength No Chip Nail Color) close to my gel polish (gelish 'Tiger Blossum-Item #01334) I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  Not looking great toward the end but tolerable!  In the beginning it is merely 'tipping' the nails .. ie using the #350 to color the tip of the nails after they wear off.  I find I must do this nearly every day .. just do this as I put on my make up .. being careful of the finger tips as I apply my make up.  Then as the gel gets to be 2-3 to 4 weeks old my nail beds have grown out at least 1/4'.  I then carefully add the #350 around the upper nail bed .. then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  I get another week out of it .. YEAH!e.

I was always using my Iphone as a timer backup for the UV lamp so this was really nice.  I found that the replacement bulbs for the UV lamp were almost $30, and the LED lamp is supposed to last 35,000 hours - so not only is it better to not have the UV exposure but cheaper in the long run.TECH TIPS:  [...]Gelish recommended cure times are based on using a Gelish Harmony LED Curing Light.  For best performance follow recommended cure times.**I think the soaking the Gel polish off in Acetone every time they come in weakens the nail bed as well. I make my client only wear it ever third time they get a manicure. I don't care what they say...it does make the nail a little weaker because of the soaking and scrapping. [...]**clients who like to peel the product off, I believe this may be why subsequent applications are not working. They are taking the top layer of keratin off. I always caution my clients not do to this and if they do, they cannot expect the product to perform the way it's designed to do. **Do buy a bottle of cuticle oil and use it over your Shellac every day (I keep mine next to my bed and put it on at night when I set my alarm) as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking. **there's a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now. Gelish, Geleration, Axxium, Gelicure... lots of them. They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.  **Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first, some, all of the above.**  [...]TIPS I PICKED UP FROM OTHER REVIEWERS:*****GELISH STRUCTURE GEL  **I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine. I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.  .. Purpose: Used to strengthen weak nails OR to equalize the level differences between the natural nail plate and applied false nail tips. Use this product after the Gelish Foundation (BASE) step has been completed  Directions: Apply 1-3 thin coats depending upon nail strength desired; curing between each application. When applying, I use a small flat brush and place a dot of gel into the center of my nail. Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail. You want to minimize the times you lift the brush from the product so as not to incorporate air bubbles. Once the nail is covered with the sculpting gel, turn your hand over keeping it level for 1 minute. This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape. Cure as directed between each application. See requirements for the cure time needed  Requirements: Gelish structure must be cured with an LED lamp or UV lamp system. LED cure time 30 seconds. 36W UV Lamp - 2 minutes  Note: For me this is a must have product. I use it on the natural nail plate up to my false nail tip on the first and second application. This helps to equal out the level differences between the two. On the third application I cover the entire nail including the false tip. Polish as desired followed by the Gelish Top If Off as the final step .  **.  **Apply with a nail art brush.  **I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure Gel. I dry brushed that layer as well and finished applying layers as directed. The end result is fantastic.  **The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream  **Debra Lynn Professional French Manicure Clean-Up Brush (Misc.)  **Notice this is called a clean up brush. That is what it does. It will even up your French manicure very easily. Don't know how anyone can do a French manicure without one. I wanted to try the French tip look with the CND Shellac process I do at home and purchased this brush for that specific purpose. This brush made even this amateur try look professional.

4584,1,"Skin is smooth after use_My sister-in-law had ordered this and I tried it and I was so pleased with how smooth my face was when I put it on.  Face didn't breakout with use, just continued to feel smooth.  Now I use on skin when I'm using NuFace NuFace Trinity my NuFace micro current facial machine (instead of buying their serums).  I have other serums, this was a good value."
5759,1,"Good Eye Make-up Set_The one minus is for the eyeliner brush, it is just hard to work with coz it is too thick, i can tell from the pic, so i ordered another Fine Liner Brush, and i am glad i did. I use this eyeliner brush in the set as lip brush, so useful after all. Other  brushes are all great, i especially love the eye brow brush, it is just easy to work with, and great results with eye brow powder."
3817,1,What I expected_Not really much to say about this except that it's exactly what I expected. Works just fine! I am happy.
82,0,"Not a gymnast_Retrieving these requires gymnastic ability that i sadly do not possess. They are also very messy to remove. I tried them because i have a dermatological sensitivity to rayon, but no. In the trash and done. Never again."
7999,1,"Great Bonnet!!_This Bonnet had the best reviews for a great price, so I figured I'd give it a try. I'm using it right now as we speak! It's super quiet, I can even watch TV while I'm conditioning my hair :-) My mom's old dryer bonnet was really loud.This bonnet in a pretty purple carrying case. It's easy to use right away and shipped very fast!Only my first time using it, but I love it so far!!!"
258,1,"Innocent_*Description from essie.com: 'a dusty dark pink. 'I was actually expecting something darker than this is. To me this is more of a peachy-pink. It is saturated enough that you don't need a lot of coats, but I wouldn't call it 'dark' by any stretch of the imagination. I think I was expecting something more mauve. When I wore it on my fingers, I felt like it was really similar to my skin color (I'm quite pale, with a lot of red/pink. It really is a nice color though and I even gave a bottle of it to my sister and she told me she loves it. I think it's just not 'my thing' right now, but who knows? It may grow on me."
2283,1,"Fair & White Soap...Love this Soap!_Based on the reviews of others I tried this soap and love it. Don't love the price but it is what it is. My husband commented when we were in Spain recently how soft, smooth and young my skin looks. I did not however use on vacation due to the amount of time I would be in the sun but I am back now and am out so I logged in to buy more.Well worth the purchase. Don't look for results for they will be visible in a few weeks.Yes I am African American."

1746,1,"decent product for pregnancy acne_I been having massive breakouts during my trimester and I came across Belli skincare. I normally used the traditional acne remedies like salicylic, benzoyl peroxide, gylcolic acid but this uses lactic acid so it's safe for pregnancy. Of course it doesn't have the same type of results but it's a good alternative to what I use. The cleanser is like a gel but doesn't lather up much. The cleanser is a bit drying on my skin so I use it either other day. I have combination skin with pregnancy breakout."
4657,1,"I love this makeup!_This gives such great coverage but it seems to not last that long which makes me sad, that being said I'm glad I can come on Amazon and NOT pay full price!! Other than that I would but this again!"
1707,1,"Very hydrating, but unsure of the benefits for fading acne scars_To lend context, I'm 30 years old and I have terribly problematic skin.  It's sensitive, dry and acne prone which can be a frustrating combination and in the winter time when the air is at its driest, it has a tendency to look dull even with a humidifier.  Because of all of these issues I'm pretty picky about the products I use and expect a lot from my skin care.I really like this product.  I've been using it in place of a typical moisturizer and it seems to work pretty well for that purpose for me, even in the winter time.  I found it to be very hydrating for a lotion, yet it absorbs pretty quickly (great if you want to put on makeup afterward).  I like that after it absorbs I can no longer feel it on my skin, unlike creams that sometimes just seem to sit on the surface and have an unpleasant feeling.  I also didn't think it negatively interfered with applying makeup.The one thing I will say is that I haven't seen the dramatic fading of acne scars as others have mentioned.  I am prone to cystic acne so it is possible mine are more severe, but any fading seems to be subtle.  Honestly the only thing that has worked to fade my acne scars has been peels from the dermatologist and even then it doesn't fade them completely.  That said, I figure using this as part of my regime certainly can't hurt.Overall, I think this is a good product."
5834,1,Great Lamp_I wanted to try gel nail polish so I reviewed tons of UV lamps. I didn't want to spend a fortune on it since i wasn't sure if i would like gel nail polish. This one had the best reviews for the price. I got to say it is perfect no need to buy and expensive one. Very easy to use and has a great amount of space for your hand and/or foot without having to worry about touching the side and messing up your nails. Only werid thing about it is when i unpacked it it had a layer of tape or ceranwrap or something to protect the machine from scratches during the shipment that took some time to peel off but it came off with no problems. The light bulbs just snap in easily and i have use it for 2 sets of finger nails and 1 set of toes so far perfectly. oh and i am using the gelish brand name of nail polish.
5084,1,"love_I mixed it with other oil my hair grow two inch. I love this product if you looking for hair grow you can buy the whole product with it such as the shampoo, conditioner and more. I like to mixed them with rosemary oil, pepper mint, coconut oil, Haitian oil, Moroccan oil, seed oil and clary sage oil, Jamaican Black Castro Oil."

9105,1,"Turn Back the Clock_Yalmeh Peerless Beauty Youth Aloe Eye Cream has helped reduce and eliminate the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes, nose and mouth. As skin ages it dries which causes lines to stand out more. A moisturizing eye cream, such as Yalmeh with the natural emollient of Aloe fills the lines and softens and soothes the skin reducing the appearance of wrinkles and lines.I quickly saw results after one week of use. A tiny bit goes a long ways. Easily glides on the skin and quickly absorbs. Use with Yalmeh Peerless Beauty Aloe Day-Night Moisturizing Cream for the complete facial regimen.Sample provided for review."
8938,1,"works with nothing to further irritate_First off the price was to good not to try. Second, there is nothing to further irritate your already broken skin! They do 'stick' but not a gluey band aid type of stick. (reminds me of when you get a debit/credit card and there is clear 'glue' attaching it to the paper)They are not invisible but they are light and you won't even feel them. For me I didn't have a lot of time yesterday so I had two on for about 3 hours, they turned white within that time. I am not sure that you could sleep in them unless you sleep solely on your back. They just aren't sticky enough for that.I feel that even if you can't spend a lot of time wearing them around that they would be good for a quick fix to help dry them out.( make sure to wash face and pat dry. Do not put moisturizer on as it will keep them from staying on well.)"
6377,1,"smells good enough to eat_St. Ives lotion is my favorite. It is affordable. The lotion is thick and creamy but sinks in and doesn't feel greasy. This particular scent smells like a dessert. It smells so yummy! I used this lotion to help heal my leg after it was in a cast for 19 weeks. You can imagine the state of my leg when it came out of the cast. It was like a horror movie. I had rhino skin. It was so tough and dry. This lotion made my skin visibly look better in just a few days. After an entire week, my leg looked normal again. This lotion contains vitamin e which helped heal the dry skin. It is very gentle. My leg had scabs and bleeding. This lotion did not irritate my skin. It just healed it. I am a fan for life."
4197,0,"Not convinced_Bristles seem very still and irritating, and when this brush got wet my whole shower smelled like a locker room the next day."
3661,1,It works_I think this works well.  Doesn't smell great but also doesn't bother me.  I bought one for my mom too.
5437,1,not streaky and smells great_I love this gentle tanner.  One that you can use daily and not get those streaks or lines.  Good moisturizer as well.
3471,1,"The last brow pencil you will ever buy_I was a little skeptical about the universal shade, but this matches my medium brown brows better than the 'custom' color that was chosen for me at the makeup counter.  It makes drawing in your brows so easy!  It lasts a very long time too (if you are just filling in a little).  I will never look for another brow pencil again."
8059,1,"Works Great Like My MicroFiber Towel!_I got these wonderful gloves and used them as described. Styling my hair has never been more easy and really fun. I look forward to every morning after I get out the shower, I put my gloves on and pull the excess water out and start designing right then. It holds water well like microfiber towels"
9681,1,"Good for extra body..._I have very fine hair, and typically use Paul Mitchell Extra Body Sculpting Foam, which I like.  I tried this Dove Hair Styling Oxygen Moisture Leave In Foam for a few days.  I don't like it quite as well as my normal product, but it does work pretty well.  It improves the body of my hair, but it doesn't have any holding power.I used it on damp hair, and then blow dried my hair like usual.  I also tried it on my daughter's fine and semi-curly hair.  We always let her hair air dry because of her curls, and her hair was 'crunchy' with this.  It seems like the product works better for those people who blow dry their hair."
6806,1,"First time shellac user_Used one coat of this over a coat of Beau.  Loved the sparkle it added.  Please note that this is a CLEAR coat with sparkles it in, not a white with sparkles.  Great wear and this was my first time applying shellac at home.  Very easy application."
5291,1,"love this hair color._I just got  my hair trimmed last week and my hair dresser commented on how good my color looked.  I think this gives great dimension to my hair and left if in great shape.  Yes, the smell is not the most wonderful....but then again, it's hair color :-) LOL"
215,1,"very happy_This tie case is very nice.  Though it's inexpensive, it still works great.  It holds plenty of ties and has a little spot for cufflinks as well.  A great alternative if you need to travel with multiple ties."
7581,1,"Pretty, nice variety_Shipped when it said it would. Some of the pieces were out of the disk or in the wrong place, I just arranged them it was pretty easy. It has a nice variety though some pieces are a bit thick for my taste. I do like it and have used it for pedicures and on my daughters nails. Very nice!"
3646,1,"not bad._Not a bad product. I like the vibrant red color. But the other postings that it saves time didnt work for me.  Before this 1 I had a conair that lasted like 7 years.  My hair is thick and long. Usually takes me 15 minutes to blow dry with either dryer. I see a slight difference in a little more volume. Im not upset with my buy, I would probably buy again because I like quality.  So I hope it lasts for years with the quality I am getting now."
4166,0,"Nothing changed_I have not seen any difference. I saw one of the reviews saying that even her fine lines were disappearing, but to me, nothing is happening but letting my check bones a little red. It is also oily, so it gave me acne after 12 days wearing it."
1182,1,"Super Cleaner!_I never thought that I needed this stuff to clean my beauty blender and my makeup brushes because I used baby shampoo...but let me tell you, this stuff gets not only my beauty blender super clean but it cleans my makeup brushes so well that it's like they're brand new! I absolutely love this stuff...only thing I have to complain about is the smell...it smells just blah to me!"
6996,1,Brush_I love these. there are some many that I can use them for so many different looks. It is really long when it is fully opened so hopefully you have the counter space.
345,1,"wow!_I switched to more natural products once I got pregnant, and sorely missed my Secret Clinical Strength Deodorant. All the natural deodorants I tried were insufficient at blocking smell or minimizing sweat, and they all smelled terrible combined with body odor. Finally I found Crystal deodorant, and it was the very best option for me while pregnant. (Crystal goes on so nicely, and you can't feel you're even wearing deodorant, and it minimizes odor very well, so it's also worth a try!)While pregnant, I got this Home Health unscented deodorant, and it didn't work for me at all, so I went back to Crystal deodorant. Now that I've had my baby, I no longer feel the Crystal deodorant lasts as long as I want it too (it can be hard to shower regularly enough with a brand-new baby) and you can't reapply Crystal without cleaning off the odor first. I went ahead and tried this Home Health deodorant again, now that I'm no longer pregnant, and I absolutely love it now! It lasts all day, you can easily reapply even if you're starting to smell and it deals with the odor easily. I have no idea what the difference was hormonally that made Crystal better during pregnancy and this better for postpartum, but I'm very glad to have both in my medicine cabinet, and you really ought to try both of them, if you're looking for natural EFFECTIVE deodorants."
9249,1,"very nice  packaging and brush_Adorable packaging, nice brush but a bit too shiny for my taste. Use very little for daytime otherwise this is a beautiful highlighter."
24,1,"Seems ok_Have only used it for a week or so, but it seems to work ok.  I like the clean smell and the way it lathers."
8957,1,"Neat, petite and and sweet_I purchased this diminutive flat iron to have around the house when my better half stays over. I really didn't want to spend the earth and have no idea what makes a good one from a bad so I chanced at this one due to the revlon brand name, The feedback I've had from its use though has been very positive and she was very surprised at that, as her staple flat iron is much wider and was more expensive.It heats up really quickly although I'm told that it has to be set on the highest setting for it to be most effective, but of course all hair is different so having the variable heat at the touch of a button is welcome. The controls are laid out very clearly and easy to access inside the unit. There's a blood-red bright display showing temperature and a final nice touch is the power cord rotates at the base so no twists and tangles as it's used.So a very nice item at a perfect price point. Don't be fooled by the small size and low equally small price. This is worth the cash."
5737,1,love_i love love love real techniques brushes!! Im buying all the brushes ... still want the others . love love love
2330,1,"Good product_I recently coloured my hair with bright red highlights.  Of course, this red colour runs quite a bit,  However, with the Wen conditioning system, my hair is still quite healthy and glossy and it smells great!  I was concerned that this product may not be suitable for tropical climates as we tend to sweat quite a bit (even in our heads!) BUT ... it works well.You still have to use quite alot, but, it works!"
3370,0,Doesn't work for me_I was really excited about trying this conditioner along with the  shampoo as the ones with lots of chemicals tend to make my head itch.  It has a nice smell but whether it is the shampoo or the conditioner my hair is left with that little heavy oily feel to it.
6049,1,"Drying simplified_I really love this. I had a good hair drier previously, but kept looking at this because it promised I wouldn't have to do the whole heavy drier above my head pointing down and round brush in the other...the whole system is worth it because of the result, but still very awkward, hard to master and time consuming. So one day when these went on sale at my workplace, I decided to get it, and I'm so glad I did!Its very light, especially in contrast with my old drier, but still very powerful and super easy to wield. And its ability to dry and polish my hair is amazing. My hair goes from thick damp frizzing mess to straightened, smoothed awesome in a few strokes and curls. This has probably taken at least 30 minutes off my styling routine because it can take off ALL the water still on your hair and it does a considerable amount of work that would have gone to my straightener afterwards.I can't get over how much easier this is! How are normal hairdriers still selling when  this exists? To my curly gone straight girls out there, let me save you a lot of time: get an earth therapeutics hair towel, organix Moroccan organ creme leave in mist, this, and a good straightener and use them in that order. Done. Lasts a freaking week! I would wager two if I was willing to go that long without shampoo!"

If I have a pimples that's going away, I leave a dollop of this soap on it overnight and the next day there are no signs of a pimple ever being there. It's a conspiracy.This stuff helps with razor bumps on your vajayjay aswell. After using this for sometime your gina skins will be even toned, bump free, and luxurious baby. It's great for my body but I have to use it sparingly on my face. With too much use my face becomes dry and annoying.

7298,1,"works as expected_I got this really for my husband to try.  He has been complaining for the past year about his scalp being itchy and flaky, although I have never noticed it.  Over the past year, I bought many different shampoos for him.  He's tried them and really never noticed a difference.  He is a marine so his hair is cut in a high and tight (really no hair).  He tried this about 2 weeks ago and I wanted to wait some time to review it just to make sure.  He said he really loves this stuff.  He said he no longer has dry, flaky scalp and he also said this rinses out nicely.So, of course, I had to try it and it's true.  This stuff is great.  It has a pleasant scent, makes the hair feel soft, not too overconditioned and I did notice that MY scalp was healthier.My husband is now putting it on the shopping list to get.Great product."

3937,1,"Like Growing to Love_I actually have the 3rd addition, and this is definitely a Kit for someone who is not a beginner. If you look at all the youtube videos you will believe that it is super easy to get a vibrant color from this collection, but it takes a little talent, skill, primer, and use of your fingers, because brushes aren't really gonna do it. The makeup wells are smaller than i thought they would be, but they are adequate, and their are very few shimmer colors which are the new hot thing. With that said I do really like the KIT and I would order another- when they come out with a shimmer addition. i have been doing my make up for a while, so I know how to achieve my desired look, but if you are a rookie all these colors are too many options... plus you might run into the issue of looking chalky. My first time using this I looked like a ghost around the eyes."
7129,1,"I like it_Motions naturally you hair gloss for me I like it! its lite not heavy and all you need is small amount also love the scent as well, I would recommend this product for all types of hair"
3961,1,good soap_The soap fits the product description. I have no complaints with it. It works exactly as I expected it to.
8322,1,"Shiny and smooth hair_I love the subtle smell of this shampoo.  This is the aloe and bamboo version. We usually buy natural aloe vera and we are glad to find it in this shampoo. Even without conditioner, our hair looks shiny and smooth after using this shampoo. Suave are also usually very reasonably priced."
4629,1,"Hello Hydration!_I love Yes to products, and this one's a keeper!A small amount is needed to produce a soft, smooth lather!  I end up putting a tad too much on because I love the way it feels!Kind of smells like carrots, but it's not a strong smell by any means.It leaves your skin feeling moisturized after rinsing!I don't get the 'no lotion needed afterward' comments.  It's winter, and I need some freakin' lotion.  I purposely didn't put some on this morning for this review--yeh, just checked--dry skin alert.I'll be purchasing Yes to's body butter for that problem.Anywho--great size bottle for the price (about $9 in stores).  It should last well over a month and a half at least!Thanks for reading!"
7619,1,Salon Towel_Salon Guys sent me one towel as a sample to review this product and I was really glad to get the opportunity to try it out because I've recently been looking in to the whole idea of microfiber towels. These towels are a great size for drying your hair and they are even a little longer than what I expected which is great for draping around the shoulders. I was impressed that it came with very clear instructions on how to care for the microfiber towel particularly when it comes to laundering because that really gives you the opportunity to get the longest use out of your towels. It is absorbent and drys quickly and I would definitely consider purchasing an entire set.
6045,0,Review_This does not blow enough hot air. Could not use and had to send back. Dealer was very helpful but I just didn't like the product.
7374,1,"Love this brush for foundation_Great overall brush for applying any kind of liquid foundation. I use this in conjunction with my Sigma F80 Flat Top Kabuki, and both give a nice finish, but I prefer this one for application, and the other for buffing. Super affordable and good quality!"
6998,1,Very nice_These brushes are really very nice. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality for how much i paid for them
3771,1,Exactly what I wanted._I received exactly what I wanted and hoped for. A much better quality than I feared it might be because of the low price. Very happy with this product.
3623,1,"cheap but very functional_I have waist-length, color-treated hair that tends to dry out.  I have started treating my hair with coconut oil a couple of times a week because I had read several places that this would improve the condition of my hair (so far, seems to be working).  However, I'd been trying to keep my hair out of the way while the coconut oil was in my hair (for 30 minutes) by balling it up and holding it with a scrunchie, and this was not working.  I was getting drips of coconut oil all over my skin, clothes, etc.  So I went looking for something that would keep my hair off my clothes during the coconut oil treatment, and I ordered these caps from Amazon.I am really pleased with the purchase.  These hold all my hair and minimize drips.  They fit my head very well; even though the package says 'extra large' and my head is on the small side, the elastic band stays snug enough against my head.  I can wear glasses with these on.  Also, they don't bother my ears (I have 6 piercings in each ear, including 2 in the cartilage on each side -- some beauty salon-style caps can be uncomfortable, but these are perfect).Also, the price I paid for a 100-pack was between $8 and $9, which means these are 8 or 9 cents each.  At that price, I just throw them away after one use -- no messy cleanup.  And the number you get in the package (100) means it'll last me close to a year.I am not sure you would want to use these in place of real shower caps, for actually keeping water out of your hair while showering or bathing, as they're pretty flimsy.  However, technically, they're not marketed for such a use anyway (although I note that some of the other reviewers use them for just this purpose).  For hair treatments, at any rate, these are great."
672,1,"Solved a major problem_This is my wife's review: Egyptian Magic is a very effective cream to treat the itching and burning of skin irritations. The olive plant base is soothing, and the other ingredients (mostly natural by-products from bees) make for a great combination. I got this on the recommendation of my doctor, and it seems to have completely resolved a very irritating condition that has been nagging me for many months. We tried several other prescription medications, but this over-the-counter product seems to be the answer. It's odorless, which also is a plus."
9987,1,"works like a charm!_I have had the chance to try a few things from Adovia's line. Not one single product has given my sensitive skin a reaction. When you first open it, there isn't much scent to it. Which is wonderful! When applying it to your face, it is super silky and leaves no feeling of &#34;greasiness&#34;. It absorbs quickly so if you want to wear it under makeup you dont have to wait forever for it to 'set in'. The best part is, a little goes a long way. I was using the little bit in the cap for the longest time before I actually had to scoop into the jar itself.  Not only does it feel amazing on your skin, but it actually works! After using it at night before bed, and having a sleepless night, I woke up and found almost no bags under my eyes, and it even has started eliminating the crows feet I have! If you are looking for a new cream, this is def worth the try!!"
7615,1,works good_I like this product.  It does work well. I do my brows last and have found that traces of powder/foundation end up on the stick and then into the tube.  I guess I should do them first but am concerned with if the powder would cake onto my brow.
6636,1,great set!_Love this case and brush set! I'm not sure what some of them are for...but I'm sure I will figure it out. I do love that tthe bristles don't fall out and stick to my face like the other brush set I have!
1568,1,"Works really well_For the past few years, I've been using Sonia Kashuk's Remove for cleansing my eye makeup, but it doesn't do as great of a job with thicker mascaras or Urban Decay eyeliners.  I thought I'd give this Mary Kay one a try since it won an _Allure_ magazine award, and I'm glad I did.  It doesn't irritate my sensitive eyes, doesn't leave an oily residue, and takes off even the toughest makeup.  Great product that I will definitely be re-purchasing!"
5862,1,"Happy about finally getting my complete set!_What I mean by 'complete set' is, when I received my product I only got 24 plates not the full 25 but not to worry because when I notified Bundle Monster through Amazon, and immediately got a reply. They replied within 30 mins actually and I received my missing plates as promised (in 3-5 days). I haven't had a chance to use the whole set yet, but the few plates I have had a chance to play with came out pretty nice. Overall good product,and  good costumer service."
8086,0,"So Thin, It's a Sin!_I was so excited to have finally received my purchase after weeks of waiting. I opened the package only to find the wefts were very thin. I was very disappointed. Not only were they thin, but to add to the lack luster experience when I lightly and gently passed my fingers through the pieces, they started to shed. I have yet to wear them because I need another pack for it to look natural. The only positive thing out of the entire experience was that I finally found a great color match. If you are thinking of buying, don't just buy one pack....buy a few!"
4317,1,"My Holy Grail for Wigs, Weaves, Extensions, etc._I do not use this on my natural hair but I use it for my extensions, wigs, and weaves and I must say, this is THE ONLY PRODUCT that keeps all of my hair units looking and feeling and behaving as if I just bought them. I recently dyed a naturally dark brown wig blonde and of course dying it blonde will make it dry and strip it of moisture...soon as I add this stuff (I leave it in for about 1-2 hours) and rinse it off with cold water...can you say herbal essence hair commercial!"
3104,0,"Just o.k._In my opinion, there are other products on the market that can do what this product claims to do.  I found it to be nothing special. It was too oily for my hair, and did just o.k for my skin.  I didn't feel the need to keep purchasing this product."
9733,1,"A Scented Gardenia and White Tea Essence Bar Soap_This is a nice soap and carries a heavy scent, the scent of gardenia and white tea essence.  The package says it is made in the USA and comes from Unilever in Connecticut. The actual bar measures approximately 3 1/4 long X 2 1/4 wide X 1&#34; deep.  This is a soap for someone who likes to smell like they just came out of the shower.  If you like that perfume like smell, you should like this soap."
4076,1,"Best Makeup I Have Ever Tried!_I purchased this primer along with the matching foundation in cocoa and I have to say that this is the best blended, natural looking combo I have ever found. This makeup stayed on my face from morning to night as I went to a wedding in 80 degree weather and a very hot church. By the time I got home from being out all day sweating it looked like I had just applied my makeup. I think this is a great investment and to think I purchased the primer and the foundation as a splurge product! I am a very happy customer!"
5914,1,"Works for me_I'm in my low 20's but I like to use retinol for targeted issues. I like this one because it comes in a pump rather than a jar. I love the organic content; those sort of 'healthy' ingredients is what I look for in my beauty products, and it is hard to find in a retinol cream."
6327,1,"Beautiful Color_This is a light pink ...... not sheer and has just the right amount of shimmer.  I would say it's lighter on your nail than the color shown on MY computer.  This went on easily and filled in my imperfections on my nail very well.  I'm new at doing my own nails with the gel polish, but I would definitely buy the Red Carpet brand again.This will probably become my go to color."
6102,0,"Stupid_Ugh! Why did I think for a second this would ever work???! Lol it was cheap so no harm done, oh well"
1944,1,"Truly a MIRACLE product!_I have tried many, many 'miracle' products, but this hair mask truly delivers what it promises.  Excellent product, excellent results!"
9488,1,"great for dry skin and dry hair_I struggle with dry skin on a daily basis. Argan oil is great to help combat it. After applying to my dry skinned face, it is instantly smoother, and the dry flakes of skin seem to just disappear. When at first it is applied, for me, it tends to be a bit oily. However, it does tend to absorb somewhat fast into the skin everywhere, with the exception of my hands, which doesn't seem to absorb at all. This is the case with all argan oil though in my experience, and not just this specific brand. For hair, you will find yourself using less conditioner to help keep it smooth and non frizzy. There is no reason I wouldn't rate this argan oil 5 stars. Would recommend to anyone with dry flaky skin, or dry hair."
6889,1,"Works Like a Charm!_I am a fan of Cetaphil cream. I love the way it works! When I saw the Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash, I knew I had to try it.I LOVE IT!I like the foam. I like the way it smells. It smells like it means business. I also like the way my skin feels afterward. You know how some cleansers make your skin feel like it's stretched too tight? Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash doesn't do that. My skin feels clean and refreshed after using it.I recommend Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash!"
9850,0,"Does not work for my thin fine hair_I don't usually use styling tools on my hair.  I have thin fine hair that does not curl well.This product:1. The attachment really don't seem to work well2. with my thin fine hair it does not seem to curl my hair at all3. it does do a nice job straightening my hair4. It heats up quite quickly (which is a disadvantage if you have it on briefly then want to change attachments5. I've used other straighteners -- This one does not run through my hair as smoothly as I would like.If you have hair that has been resistant to styling products I recommendInfiniti Professional Nano Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron, 1-Inch."
6847,1,smells good_Got this for my husband and he is happy.  Alot of shampoo for the cost and he alone will have it to use for quit some time.  Bought 3 bottles at one time.
6687,1,"Convenient, effective!_Nothing too sexy about a sunblock product:  does it work, and is it convenient?  BB Sport Cool Zone Sunscreen was easy to apply, felt good on my skin, and protected me from sunburn.  Did its job and I will purchase more when this bottle is done.  'Nuff said!"
7536,1,"PERFECT GIFT._my best friend got this for me cause she knows that i want to be a professional make up artist one day and i have tons of make up and i do other peoples makeup from time to time so she bought this for me for my birthday and its just perfect its so light weight , stores so much stuff, and its durable , i love it"
8196,1,"another winner from cheeky!_This company just has the best plates and series of plates. I will continue to get their plates every time a new series comes out. They are well made, have very nice backers to keep fingers safe and have images that appeal to all ages."
3527,0,"packaging very difficult to use_i originally contacted amazon because i could not access the creme throughthe tubing.  i was then told how to release it by banging it on a table.  this worked for 2-3 times and then no matter how hard i tried, i could not get the air pump to work.  my major complaint is that the company does not address this issue with its product, and furthermore the pump does not continue to work.i would never rebuy nor recommend this product"
2152,1,"Neutrogena Strikes Again_I like Neutrogena in general. I find that their products (for the most part) are pretty easy on my skin and won't break it out.Now, I'm quite fair-skinned, and I want to keep it that way. I burn easily, even in the winter, if it's a clear sunny day. Because of some of the stuff I put on my skin regularly, it is an absolute requirement that I have a good sunscreen on hand to use every single day, or else it'll pretty much negate all my efforts to make my skin look better.So on my search for a good sunscreen, a friend's mom showed me this stuff. I'd been eager to try it out for myself, because I'd heard it works really well and I hate greasiness of regular 'ol sunscren.It certainly doesn't make my skin greasy, but it leaves a bit of shine, like most sunscreens do. When I put it on, I barely know it's there, which is a huge plus! I just get a generous amount and cover any area that'll be exposed to the sun before I start the day.The only drawback to this stuff is that it has a sunscreen-ish smell that I'm not particularly fond of, it's not a reeking, knock-you-out dear god what is that kind of smell, but it is strong enough to where you'll know it's on, and anyone close to you might catch a whiff, too. I'm not going to lie, when I first sniffed it, I was really really hesitant to slather it on...I usually have to spray on some body spray to cover it up, or else people will wonder why my skin smells so weird. After a while, though, maybe half an hour, I notice the smell kind of diminishes, but it's still there if you waft hard enough.All in all, I like this sunscreen. As an avid sunscreen fanatic (for good reasons, of course!) who wears SPF 45 all year round, even in the wintertime, this is honestly one of my favorite products I've found. It's not too expensive, I got it on sale for about $7, and if you use it every day, it should probably last you a few weeks (provided you're putting enough on!)The only drawback is the smell, while it's not bad, it's noticeable, but I think it's still a great sunscreen that's worth a shot if you're looking for something that won't make your skin feel like a slip-n-slide."
7225,1,nice sharp tools_a good deal for the price
3960,1,"Great product_I have been using different exfoliators and facial masks and find this one to be the best for my combination skin. I am in my 50's and don't want to damage my skin, but need to get rid of the dry skin which is a problem in a climate with low humidity. I have recommended this to my family and friends."
6116,1,Cute_Good quality colors are true and shining love itI will recommend  this product is a perfect deal my nails look cute
3091,1,O.k._This brush works well to clean up your manicure but I find that it is not that great to make the smile lines. The bristles are not compact enough for that.
5098,0,Not for me_Used it twice and gave it away. Thick and heavy.  Didn't like the way it felt on my skin.  Sorry
7930,1,"SODIAL- 5 X Nail Art Acetone Polish Makeup Corrector Remover Pen + 15..._great tool for polishing nails,as we all know we always make a mess unless someelse does it for us.great price,a lot for ur money."
5729,1,Just as advertised !_I broke my airbrush that I use for makeup.  Believe me I missed it a lot because NO MAKEUP is like actual airbrush makeup.  This wand was just as advertised and fit my airbrush set perfectly !!
3291,0,"not met expectations_I heard so many good reviews on this and figured i would give it a try. I bought the travel size and the regular size. Man am i disappointed. This leaves a sticky, hard hair spray life residue on my hair. Makes my hair feel really stiff and un natural. Im cant believe i spent over $20 on these. I am going back to my sauve keratin infusion dry shampoo thats only $3. Works so much better.The only thing that i do like is the scent.Some people complain that the smell is strong, but i like it. Even my boyfriend commented that my hair smelt good."
2386,1,"If not for cost, I would have given it 5_I admit that these crystals are great. But they are simply 120 grit aluminum oxide crystals. I bought these for use after the 25% TCA peel (also by Skin Obsession), and they work fabulously. The part that irks me is that I normally find a cheaper, albeit same quality product before I buy. I didn't this time *le sigh*. If I had, I would have seen that right here on Amazon I could have gotten 5 lbs. of the same thing for just a few dollars more. To the home user, a gallon might seem unnecessary. Let me explain. Having used two other popular brands of microdermabrasion, while they left my face feeling somewhat fresher after use. they lacked oomph. With these crystal, you add water or your favorite face cleanser-in my case, CeraVe-at the amount you like. I prefer mine somewhat dense for that illusive &#34;oomph&#34; I mentioned. I like to do this 2-3 weekly. That fact alone will not make this worth it's cost. Now add other family members in my home who also use it. Catch my point? You would be better off ordering the 5 lb. jug even if you don't cleanse with it as much as I. Heck, repackage as gifts. Have spa parties.  Here they are: Microdermabrasion Crystals - 5 Lbs (Grit 120) - Exfoliating Skin Care. by NeedCrystals"
987,1,So I use it for......._I guess I'll be the first to admit that I use this in the shower and yes it does work. I still use body wash and bar soap of course. But for that extra feel of confidence I wash my underarms 30 seconds (each underarm). And yes you can wash your va jay jay with it for those who may need an extra feel of freshness! Just saying'. I will order another one for the kitchen.....but yeah it's great.
4609,1,love these_so cute!
8548,1,"Soft Hair!_I've been using this product for about a week now mostly as directed, although I use more than directed as 3-4 drops doesn't seem to be enough. Basically I put some drops in my palm and fingertips and massage it into the roots a bit and onto the ends.After a few weeks of use, I find that my hair is softer, shinier and thicker. I just got my hair cut today and my hairdresser said that my hair was the softest she's ever cut. Hopefully she doesn't that to all her clients, but I must admit my hair does look fantastic!"
5753,1,"The best economic brushes Ive had._Im a fan of Samantha's tutorials on youtube, so as soon as I was able to buy this brushes I did, most of all because Ive seen that a lot of other makeup artists use them as well. They are affordable and soft, easy to clean, some of them have a lineal base so they stand up on vanities and desks. This particular set has 4 brushes, all with the same color (which corresponds to face) and their bristles are synthetic so they can work powders, creams, liquids and minerals:1. The pixel detailer brush: this is meant to be as concealer brush. however, its really tiny, so I use it for lips and also for gel eyeliners, when i dont want a perfect line.2. The Pointed foundation brush: This one has a triangular shape, and its flat: This one I use for concealer around my nose for example. Never for foundation.3. The contour brush: I love this one, specially for the size. Its meant to be for contouring, and it fits  perfectly in the hollow of the cheeks. However, my face is kinda small, so must of all the blush brushes are big for the surface I want to deal with, so this has doubled as blush brush, with incredible results.4. The Buffing Brush: i didnt expected to love this one but its my favorite so far. My foundation has never looked this great, and I havent changed it. Its great for powders too, but as I said, I use it as my prime foundation brush.I would definitely buy this again, though I just would want the buffing and the contour brush, its worth every penny."
9209,1,I love_This deep cranberry-wine color so much I ordered two more bottles for the future....never know if they will discontinue or not.
4543,1,"Good Buy!_Yes! Just what I wanted and for the price!  Amazing I used right away and I love it, about the light in my opinion it's great in others idk but I think it was a good choice (:"
5887,1,Works great_I use this under the medium concelealer & my ugly dark circles go away. It looks completely natural. Can't do much about the mild puffiness but at least it's much less noticeable.
3957,1,"GORGEOUS, GORGEOUS, PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!_These came in the mail and are GORGEOUS. They are perfect in every way. Just flawless.  If you are thinking about buying these, get them, because they are everything you want and hope them to be!!!!! They look beautiful in your hair too!!"
1656,0,"Defective pump but problem fixed by seller  but second broke too_We love the product and bought this larger bottle after using the smaller one... But we cant get it out of the bottle due to a non-functioning pump...  I tried to fix it by cleaning it and priming it with water, but it wont even pump water .. I filed a complaint and will revise this if they can resolve, but I will not buy this again in this size.Seller sent me a new bottle ! WOW  ..Revising rating again --  down this time,  because the pump on the second bottle has now failed... Nice product, junk packaging.."
8114,1,"ADDS VOLUME_My hair is fine and thin and it is hard to find product that will give it enough volume. This product has done that. I was sceptical at first but thought I would give it a try. It exceeded my expectations. I have used Christophe products in the past and have been delighted with them. This product definitely meets the standards of the Christophe brand. It is easy to use, just follow the directions of spraying near the roots and blow dry into your favorite style. Lasted until I washed my hair 2 days later. I will definitely purchase on a regular basis."
3988,1,"Another phenomenal cleanser from Olay_The Olay cleansers I have tried have always left my skin feeling soft, refreshed, and without overdrying. The Olay Exfoliating renewal cleanser is no exception.The micro breads gently massages the face, enough to clean out pores. It's not as harsh as theSt. Ives, Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub, 6oz, but still has the properties to refresh my face.I'm in my mid 20s, and it has kept my skin feeling soft and clear. This the go-to cleanser in my facewash regime.Highly highly recommended!"
6493,1,"Decent product for the price_I chose this product specifically for the gel aspect.  It is easy to lather and wash.  No problem.  I use it for trips and keep it in my packed luggage.It cleaned my face well and left me feeling soft.  However, I am a bit skeptical of some of the ingredients that are used for the softness and I still wonder why they put some vitamins in these cleansers.Overall, I think this seems to be a quality product and I would tkeep using it, especially for the easy travle aspect."
3315,1,"Get a tan without compromising your health_I used to go tanning once every week or two to maintain a healthy looking complexion. After doing some research about the negative effects of tanning (both from the sun and tanning booths) I decided to give the artificial tanning products a try. It does not give you as deep of a tan as regular tanning does but it does the job well. Most importantly it saves you from cancer causing UV rays that are unavoidable when tanning. Its also a great moisturizer and has a lot of ingredients to keep your skin healthy and looking younger. If you have acne do not worry, I actually think this product reduces acne by keeping your skin hydrated. I use it every night and every morning."
128,1,"Nice soap_I'm loving this soap. I've been using it exclusively on my face for the past couple of months and it's performing beautifully. I have combination skin and this works well with it. It is non-drying, lathers well (rich, creamy lather), and I find the scent to be light and non-offensive. After use, my skin is super clean but it doesn't make my skin feel tight at all."
4663,1,"Refreshing moisturizer without the oily feeling._My skin tends to be very oily on the T-Zone and then extremely dry on my cheeks. This moisturizer is light yet moisturizing. I really like it. It's not oily so if you have oily skin or combo like me, definitely give this moisturizer a try!"
5745,1,"finally_finally got it, very soft, couldnt ask for a better brush to apply blush. highly suggest it, real techniques is a great brand."
53,0,Overdrying_I am 23 years old with combination skin. I have used this cleanser the past two weeks and I had immediate acne flair ups as well as over drying. I was unimpressed with this product and disappointed after the reviews. Just didn't work for me.
135,1,"Great_Great product. Cleanses as promised, no harsh ingredients and the scrubber side is effective. I continue with subscribe & save and recommend highly."
483,1,Great Product_I use this with the rest of the Obagi line. My face is the best it has been for years. I buy this from Amazon & never regretted it.
8012,1,"Travel Options!_I love that this comes with all three sizes because I never know how light or heavy I am packing, now I can have an option. Not only is it great for travel but good for organizing they are great for things other that makeup such as jewelry, hair accessories, nail polishes, ect."
4986,1,PalLaguna - Love it_I have used Wen for quite a few years now and love the Pomegrante (not fig).I have also used the sweet almond.  This is good stuff for your hair.
331,1,Vanicream cleansing bar_Fast Shipping.  Love this cleansing bar.  Very lite on your skin with no irritations.  I use the Vanicream Lite Moisturizer afterwards.  Feels great...  Wouldn't use anything else.
1763,1,"LOVE IT!_I noticed a difference in my hair in just a week of using this product. My hair was shinier and a little longer. Only downfall is that it leaves your hair looking greasy, but I expected that to happen."
9046,1,"Love it!!!_When I had my hair colored at the Hair Cuttery salon, they bleached my hair and damaged it. So I was looking for something to repair my damaged hair and found this product. When I read all the positive comments about this product I didnt believe it until I have tried it. It is amazing, it is not greasy and it makes my hair look smoother and more vigorous. Though the product is great but is pricey. I would recommend this product to everyone."
8713,1,So pretty!_I gave this nail polish a five star because the color is just awesome! The twinkly stars do not really show up when I painted my nails but the color is just right and am happy with the purchase. I got many compliments with people asking me where they can get this!
5334,1,"Best eyeshadow primer_I love e.l.f products. This keeps my eye shadow in place all day. I've never tried the expensive brands and since this work beautifully ok dnt see trying them. It dries fast and doesn't end up all messy in my crease, just goes on smooth and perfect with my uneven, oily pale-Alabaster skin. I use it everyday and I have sensitive eyes. I don't have any problems with puffyness or waterying after applying this. Its prefect."
9607,1,"Great Scent, Good Results_I have been using this product for the last two weeks, shampooing and conditioning every other day, and when I stye my hair with thermal aids (either a flat iron or hot rollers) my results have been smooth and lasting. Full disclosure: I did not use the companion shampoo that was suggested on the product information, nor did I follow with the companion &#34;Treatment&#34; because I received the conditioner through the Vine program, and wasn't offered the other products. Nonetheless, I liked the conditioner and would buy it on my own. Pleasing scent--not a heavy floral. My hair smells great!"
2275,1,Perfection in a bottle_One of my all time favorite setting sprays. It is my favorite all the way down to the packaging! A little goes a long way! The product is of great quality. The smell is fantastic.  Does not create an oily finish. I use this product a lot with my professional brushes from MAC and Sigma. I also like using this with my blender sponge and applying my foundation to make it last all day and night.
3938,1,VERY WELL_It is very well although I received the shimerry ones and not the bright ones....I would buy it again.
9770,1,"Under cover Hero for my dark circles_I by heritage received these dark circles late in life and i always worried about how to get rid of them.  Well, When it arrived, I immediately put it to work on my dark circles. At first it didn't seem to work. My dark circles looked just as before. however I kept applying it every night. After applying it each night during a particularly stressful week, I used an additional tool of derma roller before I applied it and  I was pleasantly surprised to see a difference. The results were not immediate, but after about 14 days it started to work, just like the other reviews said. My eyes are gain the youthful look.  Oh, and did I mention that it is light and not sticky or greasy which makes it great in my book any day!  Kudos for the new Punch! And everyone notices the difference.."
9553,1,"Ok, but a bit drying_The male tried this face wash and really liked it. It is a lightweight face wash with a bit of scent. It is not overly harsh on the skin but he did say it was a bit drying and his skin felt a bit tight after using it."
105,1,i love this moisturizer_for a couple years i have been purchasing this oil of olay moisturizer for around 25 dollars at cvs and am amazed to find it at amazon for around 10 dollars...wow...now i can use it on my chest and hands in addition to my face and neck...
3551,1,OH MY GOSH_This set of brushes is the best set ever!!! It rivals the most expensive set out there. Great quality and excellent finishes for any makeup user!! A must have set!!
1791,1,AFFORDABLE AND UNIQUE._IT IS VERY AFFORDABLE AND UNIQUE FRAGRANCE. LONG LASTING FOR OVER TWENTY FOUR HOURS. A LITTLE GOES A VERY LONG WAY
9450,0,Wow & NO_Sorry to say this Jergens BB Cream was a waste for me. I had high hopes because the company has been in business so long. Honestly and simply never saw any improvement or felt any difference in my skin.
3669,0,"So pale I can hardly tell I'm wearing anything_I saw this lipstick advertised in a magazine and was impressed with the color. The color was deliciously frosty and a light creamy flesh tone. I wanted it instantly. Unfortunately, after I bought the color I was  disappointed. You can hardly tell I'm wearing any lipstick at all! Its like clear grease.After perusing Maybelline's site, I can see that the color is most likely the result of a lipliner pencil in the shade of N.UDE which I think is what the model is wearing. So if you want a color to look like that, you'll have to buy the pencil too."
2997,1,"Excellent Product_I love that this has a very small point, making it easy to do very light strokes that look like your actual eyebrows. The color is also good. I apply it with a very light, feathery touch."
2273,1,"Bio Ionic is very good indeed but debatable on the One Pass..._I really do like the bio ionic straightening iron.  I like that it's 1.5&#34; and therefore I can get the job done faster and it feels nice and smooth and heats up in a crazy short amount of time.  I first tried the iron at 320 degrees as per the instruction manual stated for my type of hair which is medium thickness.  It did not straighten in one pass.  Maybe 2-3.  I then turned the iron up to between 350 and 360 and then I did get the one pass straightening.  I like it a lot but really do not like having to turn the heat up to get the one pass.  Is it better to use lower heat and multiple passes or higher heat and one pass?  Would appreciate it if anyone can leave a comment about this.  Otherwise, it's a great, effective iron.  It is tempting to be able to get my hair done faster but I question the heat necessary to really get the one pass they claim."
5254,1,"L'oreal paris hydrafresh toner, 8.5 fl oz_This was a pretty good product to use, and it leaves a soft feel to the skin.  Not sure if will order again."
2444,1,"Helps; but it's not a miracle_This product is great! Massage it into your scalp while you're in the shower, and then wait 5 minutes before you rinse.  Then, wash your hair like you normally would.I purchased this because I've been plagued with dandruff/dry scalp since I moved north.  Nothing works.  This really has helped minimize my dry scalp issues, but it's not a miracle worker.  It kind of works as an exfoliator -- it will remove the dead/dry skin that has built up, that shampoo can't do alone (there are little beads in it that you can feel massaging your scalp).  It does something that shampoo can't do."
3130,1,Sensitive - not a problem_Love this - actually was reccommended by my dermatologist ! It works in restoring my skin; wake up feeling moisterized and not oily like most products. This is a refill - been using it for 2 years !
7529,1,I like it_I thought this product was larger then they appeared . This are small pencils . I thought they were alot larger
836,1,"This IS the real thing, if you bought it from Amazon.com as the vendor!_This is one of my mom's all-time favorite fragrances, but she ran out of it years ago, and hasn't been able to find it since. She mentioned a few months back that she really missed it, and would love to get her hands on another bottle, so, when she wouldn't tell me what to get her for Christmas, I told her, 'well, I know EXACTLY what to get for you, then!', and promptly placed my order for it here on Ammie. I WAS concerned, after reading comments about inauthenticity from other buyers of other fragrances here, typically sold by third-party vendors, that this might be a fakeout that had been made in China... I knew, however, as soon as mom opened up the box (as excited as she could've been to see what it was), and sighed in deep pleasure at the scent, that Ammie hadn't left me out in the cold! Once again, Amazon, you came to my rescue, and my mom has been blissfully happy every time she's opened that bottle up and spritzed herself with her coveted scent! I was bubbling over with joy yesterday when, as she walked past me after her daily spritz, she quietly said, 'best Christmas gift ever!!!'!'Cuz, when Mama's happy, everyone's happy, and Amazon has come through for me yet again, as they have countless times in the past! Thanks, Amazon! Happy Holidays to you and yours!"
6365,1,"Better then Neocutis_I am a middle-aged guy who suffers from genetic drooping of skin under my eyes. A plastic surgeon told me, basically, to just live with it because surgery would cause other, worse problems for my situation. I have tried Neocutis Lumiere and found it did nothing for my problem. This gel works well. If I apply it in the morning when I first arise, it does reduce the drooping. Not dramatically, of course, but noticeably and more rapidly than anything else I've tried, and far more than doing nothing. It has a almond scent, which I suspect is a cover-up of offending odors, but it's not a problem if one expects it and it disipates. And BTW, all these non-aerosol products with pump mechanisms can be opened up with pliers. Always, there are several days of applications left in the bottle. Follow up 6/14: I have increased my rating to 5 stars. I have now been using it form several months and I find it increasingly effective as time goes on. No, it won't make up for an evening of too much salt, wine, or insufficient sleep (BTW, I have discovered that melatonin pills may make under eye sagging worse). And a little bit goes a long way, so it is actually economical."
2680,1,"Bargus_I had a very dark and large spot from sun damage under one of my eyebrows and tried a LOT of different products, including some expensive ons, which did not seem to help at all.  I then tried this one and within a few days the spot began to fade!!!  It is MUCH less noticeable now and seems to be fading even further with daily use.  This is the first product that had results in a short time.  My only complaint is that it is taking a long time to fade more but as I have had that spot for at least ten years, I certainly can be patient."
7695,1,love this color_This is great for accent nails or you can put one coat on to add glitter to your nails or designs.  It arrived on time and in good conditon
7654,1,Love it!!_I love this brush very much! It's the perfect size and applies products so well. I totally love it and highly recommend it!
7867,1,"Very fun!_I love these lashes, lots of different styles to try- I like some better than others personally. The description &#34;from subtle to overthetop&#34; is very accurate. I would say the tend to lean a bit more toward overthetop however.When I first tried SHANY eyelashes they have a thicker base that I was used to, which took a bit getting used to the feel of. However it also makes them better for wearing multiple times.Make sure you have some eyelash glue separately though, because most of the mini glue containers that were packaged with the lashes either I couldn't get any glue to come out of, or what did come out was slightly hardened and didn't work at all."
547,1,"Honeysuckle Rose has always been my staple deep conditioner!_I am an African woman with 4b hair. My curls are as tiny as the springs inside pens and my hair is very thick, coarse, and downright dense. I first went natural in 2009 and had a lot of trouble finding a conditioner that gave my sahara-dry thirsty hair the replenishing it desired until that fateful day I walked into a Vitamin Shoppe store looking for this conditoner thanks to the recommendations of many ladies on a black hair care forum I frequent.The moment I spread that pearly creamy goodness into my kinks, my love affair with this conditioner began. My hair drank up that conditioner like a milkshake and my hair was SOFT! Even after it dried, my hair felt nourished and soft! Not only that but my hair is insanely prone to tangling and this conditioner melted those tangles away like butter! Honeysuckle rose has never let me down. I have been using it for four years now and it is so good, I have never felt a need to find any greener grasses because I am genuinely convinced this is the best for my hair. That, and being a product junkie is expensive. Times are tough! The conditioner being $8-10 has never bothered me because it is worth it!I have noticed this year the look and consistency of the conditioner has changed so it seems they may have changed the formula. I haven't noticed a major change in the effects it has on my hair so I'll continue to use it, but from what I've read from a couple reviews on here, Aubrey Organics is not living up to their last name as strongly."
7943,1,"This is pretty cool, cheaper than 'wen' but you still use a LOT at a time_My hair is thick and just below my shoulders and it takes a lot of this stuff each shampoo time.  I've got some grey, I'm over 50 and the texture of my grey hair seems to be tougher than my normal hair, but this shampoo is good for me!Before even putting in any conditioner, my comb goes through my wet hair like buttah.  I have noticed that in order to have this wonderful phenomenon occur, I have to rinse rinse rinse rinse rinse if I use the shower.  I keep an empty quart yogurt container that I fill up and dump repeatedly on my hair while I'm still in the shower because no matter how long I stand under that showerhead to rinse, it doesn't do a good job of rinsing.  If I wash my hair bending over the sink, I let the sink fill with water and swish my hair and head and it truly leaves my hair silky even without conditioner afterwards.If I want to style my hair, I will use Garnier leave-in stuff after I get out of the shower.  Just a little bit works since my hair is good."
3728,0,"Not going on my hair or my kids!_The ingredient list for this product would require a chemistry degree to decipher.  The product smells bad.  When I put the 'dime sized' squirt on my hands to rub into my palms, it was so smelly and sticky that I knew I did not want it in my hair.  It took FOUR washes to get my hands product-free.  Mineral oil is one of the first ingredients, and I'm not excited about that on my hair either.  'Hair milk' probably just means it is white and opaque.  This does advertise itself as 'perfecting' curls or smoothing styles.  As such, it is basically a rub-in hairspray.  Not recommended."
5455,0,"TOO heavy_The support is good, the fit is just right, but the weight is too heavy.Not your typical flip flop that is lightweight.  Makes my feet ache to flip in such a heavy shoe.Sticking with Olukai- my favorite."
5910,1,Love CON_Love the whole line for my relaxed hair. My mom used these products on me when I was younger. Went in a large expensive circle (thinking I would use new fancier products) and went right back around to home :)
4706,1,"These Wraps Are Easy To Use_I use these remover wraps, to remove CND Shellac Power Polish from my nails. I find them easy to use, and they do an excellent job of removing the shellac polish, without damaging my nail. You soak the remover pad with acetone, then wrap it on your nail, and leave it on for 10 minutes. You can see how to use the wraps, by watching the following YouTube video: [...]It takes a bit of practice, to wrap the nails on both hands, at the same time.  You can start by wrapping one hand, soaking off the shellac, and removing the wraps.  Then start over, and do the same thing on your other hand.  This is easier to do, but it takes longer.  If you practice doing each hand by itself, you will be able to wrap both hands at once, in no time."
6808,1,"FINALLY a budget-friendly lipstick with a high-end payoff!_If you're like me you've been bombarded with print and television ads of actress Emma Stone (Crazy Stupid Love) repping Revlon's newest product, the Colorburst Lip Butters.  Released in 20 different colors with dessert-inspired names, the lip butters were presented as being ultra-hydrating and luscious as well as long-lasting.  And, honestly, what girl wouldn't want to look like Emma Stone?I picked up four of these on sale at my local CVS for around $5 each with coupon and promotions.  Fig Jam was the darkest lip butter I chose.  The packaging for these lipsticks is a rectangular plastic quilted-pattern tube.  The frosty color of the tube reflects the color of the product inside, which is nice and there is a clear plastic window at the very top of the tube so you can look inside and get an idea of what the color actually looks like (good move, Revlon).Fig Jam appears as a dark red-brown wine sort of a color.  In the tube it appears pretty intimidating and not something someone with a pale complexion like myself would want to try. BUT!  These are lip butters.  They are meant to be a bit shearer and glossy, so thankfully, when applied, Fig Jam makes my lips look wine kissed.  Very nice.  One layer is quite sheer with a nice pop of color, but it can be built up with additional applications.  Fig Jam is also the kind of color that leaves a pleasant color stain applied when it wears off (about three hours later).Revlon's lip butters contain mago butter, Shea butter and jojoba oil, so they do live up to their claim of being ultra moisturizing.  Considering this I was surprised by how pigmented they are as well.  And, unlike many other department store cheap-o lip products, these lip butters don't have an artificial fragrance or a rancid taste.  They are comparable to higher end makeup brands.Right now these lip butters are getting a lot of hype so you'll often find the displays raided at your local drug store.  Keep checking!  These are going to be a permanent part of Revlon's product line!"
6422,1,Neat idea!!_I have used one already and it worked well!! Better than soaking one finger at a time. LOL I will use it often.
3260,1,Eye_This is a really good base color the eyes.I would recommend this to all friend that need you help with eye shadow fading by the end of the day.
5210,0,"Old lady smell_I thought this would smell great, like a Victoria's Secret store. Nope, it smells like an old woman's cheap perfume.  It moisturizes about as well as any oher lotion, but I'd rather have one that smells good."
6217,1,Very convenient and nice to my skin_These towelettes are a staple in my bed stand drawer for those nights you just are too tired to do a the regular cleansing regime. They get all my makeup off with the exception of some stubborn eye makeup products. They are quick and disposable. I have sensitive skin but no problems using these. They are also a nice big size towelette which are also thick and soft. Thumbs up for these towelettes!
3362,1,"Almost Great - Too Faint  A Scent_I wish it was a little more potent and lasted a bit longer, but the scent itself is top drawer."
3610,0,old_The product was totally separated and I've really only seen that happen to really old products plus it smells horrible I'm scared to try it and put it on my face. Even tho it has a new sticker on it I don't believe it. Good price tho for a foundation but make up dose expire and I'm not sure this is okay anymore
2584,0,"Better than using nothing._This is a popular lotion because it's cheap and it does an ok job, but I just cannot get past the smell. It smells like dreamsicles and lemon pledge."
5240,1,Works Wonderfully!!_This works as i expected it to. Comes in a light brown and darker brown color and also came with a very handy pencil sharpener. The color looks natural and distributes evenly and hasnt smudged or anything from me scratching my eyebrow area. I would definitely buy more when i do run out.
6295,1,VERY CUTE_THIS IS SUCH A GREAT IDEA AND WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GREATLY. ALTHOUGH THE BIGGER DOTS ARE KINDA HARDER TO APPLY TO THE NAIL BUT STILL CUTE
9318,1,"Face lotion_I do not have a problem with the smell of this product as many have said.  I love the silky smooth feel of the lotion.  It is not greasy.  It advertises  12 hours of long lasting moisture but when using it out in the sun, you should reapply it every two hours to get sun protection.  I also like that it is water resistant.  I do think that it is too pricey, for this size."
6822,1,"such cute designs_I wanted this because of the cute bows; snowflakes and hearts. This is the only Konad plate I have so far; but I will get more. I did notice that it came in an ordinary letter envelope with no protective wrapping. This didn't come with the protective film like other brands, but it wasn't scratched or anything."
5703,1,Classic Color_This is an absolutely beautiful color. It is timeless. The photos don't do it justice. This color is a must have if you are planning on attending a formal gathering. It goes with everything from shorts to evening gowns.
4708,1,"Prefer these wraps over soaking_I tested these wraps by using them on one hand and soaking my other hand in a small bowl of acetone. After applying the 100% acetone to the pads on the wraps (no need to soak the entire wrap), I wrapped them on each finger and after ten minutes applied some pressure as I pulled them off and there was NOTHING left on my nails. I didn't need to use the orange wood stick at all and ALL the polish was left in the wrap.  My fingers weren't pruny from the acetone and I had nothing to clean up but to toss the wraps in the trash. On my other hand I soaked for 10 minutes and still needed to push off some persistent pieces of polish with the orange wood stick, even needed to stick my finger back in the acetone. My finger tips were pruny at the end and I had a little mess of flaked polish to clean up.  While both method's work, I will continue to use the wraps since I find them to be more convienent, cleaner, better for my fingertips and it doesn't waste as much acetone.  Perhaps you can get the same result from foil and cotton but I just like the no muss, no fuss of these wraps."
4506,0,"Clumpy_I've used this mascara on and off for a few years, and really loved it, until I purchased the Sephora Lash Stash collection.  I've found there are several other brands of mascara that plump up and lengthen my lashes WITHOUT the clumping I'd become used to over the years with The Falsies.  I doubt I will order this again since I've found other mascaras that perform better."
3980,1,"Mac 217 dupe!_This doesn't feel as gentle on my eyes as other bdellium brushes, but i believe it's because of how densely packed and tapered this brush is.  It is a perfect Mac 217 dupe, and blends out harsh eyeshadow lines effortlessly, regardless of brand."
2939,1,"As always, Aveda delivers._I use it daily as a leave-in conditioner and it has significantly enhanced the health in my hair.  No split ends anymore!  It weightlessly tames frizz, protects against heat, adds shine, and strengthens.  Get it.  You won't regret it."
5456,1,Good buy_I've used this shampoo and conditioner off and on for years.  I would't go so far as to say you'll get &#34;epic volume&#34; but its a very good mosturizing duo. My husband loves the strawberry milkshake scent.
514,1,A Bright Idea_I had never thought of putting a powder under the eye. Wouldn't it cake and settle in fine lines? Not this powder. It's feather-light and bright while it keeps Laura Mercier's creamy concealer in place. It is reflective and fine. It can also be used to set eye make-up. Who would have thought...?
9355,1,Loved Amana Organics Vitamin C Serum!_I loved this product!  I received a sample to try and am so glad I did!  I used it during our family vacation to Florida and it really helped protect my skin from the sun.  I used regular sunscreen on the rest of my body and used this on my face.  The only part of my body that wasn't burnt red with sunburn was my face thanks to Vitamin C Serum!  I've also noticed my face and skin feel softer and smoother and look more refreshed.  This product is wonderful and Ill definitely continue to use it and would recommend it to anyone!
275,1,Great_good but not really sure if it work. great for the price those. trying to experiment with different products for healthier hair.
3709,1,Totally Hooked!_This is such good stuff. All organic and so creamy. I use this for my conditioner cleansing (no shampoo for me) - it leaves my hair so nicely conditioned! My hair has that nice heavy hang from all the moisturizing ingredients. Great 1st step in my hair routine. Have used this for 2 years with great results. Great to detangle my curly hair with - nice slip.Can also be bought at Lakshmi's Cupboard online store for $4.40. Ships same or next day.
6055,1,"Love this cologne!_I bought this cologne for my boyfriend for Christmas, and it smells delicious! It isn't too strong and it isn't too weak, and just a few sprays last all day. It has a manly/ocean-like smell to it. I will literally sit next to him and smell him whenever he wears it because it smells so good! Definitely a good investment."
8480,1,Sticky for great spikes_It's nice to have products that are designed for men (and therefore don't smell like apples) that work well on mens styles.  This product works well for creating spikes on short hair.
3615,1,"A good variety from a great brand_I liked all of these BB creams, and this set was helpful in finding the right one for me without spending the full price on each.I'll write a quick review on each, starting with my least favorite to my favorite.Super Plus(the gold tube): I like the coverage, but it was a little dark for my fair (but olive-toned) skin. It was also very thick in texture. It was similar to Missha's Perfect Cover, which I didn't really like because both feel a bit heavy on my face. However, this bb cream has a more natural finish than Missha's. It lasts maybe 6 hours or more. Overall I'd rate this one 7/10. I would recommend it to someone who prefers more coverage and has skin that isn't super fair. It's good for oily/combination skin.Super plus triple function (hot pink tube): Really good BB cream. It has good, buildable coverage and doesn't feel too heavy on my face, although you can kind of feel it sitting there. It also has a very natural finish. My only problem with it is that it is a little too dark for me. I like that it lasts all day. Great for oily/combination skin. I'd rate it 9/10.Luminous Pearl(white tube): I love this bb cream so much. It's very sheer, so the coverage isn't great.. It has enough coverage to hide minor discolorations, but not blemishes. But, it has a natural-looking, luminous sheen that looks beautiful on cheekbones, the bridge of your nose, and other places you'd like highlighted. If you have very dry skin, you could probably get away with using it all over your face, but otherwise, it would look kind of silly as it is very shiny, although not in an oily or glittery way. It has glitter particles, but they're too small to notice on your face. This is also the lightest of all the BB creams in the set. As a BB cream, I rate this 6.5/10, but as a highlighter, I rate it 10/10.The Prestige (light pink tube): My favorite! I love this one. It has semi-sheer, buildable coverage, perfect for someone like me whose skin is fine except for dark circles and a few acne scars. It lasts a long time, like the rest of the bb creams here. It has glitter particles in it like the luminous pearl, but they do not make your face shimmery as much as give it more of a naturally dewy look. This is lighter than the super plus and super plus triple function BB creams, but darker than the luminous pearl. It is similar to the finish and color of Etude House's Precious Minerals Bright finish BB Cream, but has a sheerer coverage and feels much, much lighter on your skin. I would recommend this for anyone with dry or dull skin, or anyone who wants a bit of an extra glow to their face, and also to those who seek very natural-looking coverage. It's also great for people who don't necessarily like wearing makeup because it looks and feels like you're wearing nothing, except a lot better of course. I give this 10/10. It suits my needs perfectly, although I recognize that someone might rate this the lowest and the super plus the highest according to what their skin needs.I ended up  purchasing the Prestige bb cream. I can see myself using it every day. I may buy the luminous pearl as a highlighter in the future, but I'm unsure if it's worth it to buy the full sized tube for that purpose. I'm glad I bought this set because I would have bought the Super plus triple function based on all the hype from youtube gurus, and it just wasn't right for me. I definitely recommend buying this set if you're interested in skin79's bb creams, but unsure of which one will work for you."
38,1,"Nice and Smooth_This product is very gentle on the skin. I was so pleased with the fact that you only need a little and it goes a long way. I like the smell, it is not heavy and is easy to enjoy. I could see myself buying more."
5081,1,"Superior_This product is my favorite of the Sweetsation line. I really can not come up with anything bad to say. In fact, I am making this part of my permanent face care collection. I am not a girly girl, but I do enjoy knowing that I am using a healthy, safe product. A little bit of this product goes a long way, making the expense cheaper than most over the counter, generic products. There is a nice light natural scent to it. I can not tolerate anything with fragrance or chemical smell. This product had this natural scent that is nice and doesn't bother me at all. After applying, my face glows, almost immedietly. After about 5-10 minutes of application my face literetly has a healthier, different look to it.I started using this product because I want to lighten some of the many sunspots I have, mainly the ones on my face. I didn't expect it to do all that it does; gives a glow and healthy look within 10 minutes and the look stays with you. I looked in the mirror a few hours after I applied it to see if the fresh look went away, and it didn't. It is not greasy at all, which is a super bonus for me. I can't stand having to go back and wipe off greasy products, and with this I don't have to do that ever. I little bit, maybe pea size can do almost your whole face. I am actually going to use this product as a permament moisterizer because even for that it works better than anything I have ever used.I only use sweetsation products and will not bother even trying anything else. There are a few main reasons why I like sweetsation line; the cost is actually cheaper than any other product as a little really does go along way. No greasiness to the products, and they really are healthy and safe with no chemicals and so forth in the ingredients. One of the main reasons is because of the customer service. The owner is very kind, as I said. I felt uncomfortable initially asking her a questions a few months ago about one of her products ( I emailed from her website) and I am glad I did, because she emailed back right away and was extremely helpful and honest. I won't shop any other line of products and this review is not being biased because of this. This product really is amazing, and I am so glad the owner developed it. If you have any questions, no matter how small they seem, or how large they seem, email the owner, I can't say enough good things about her and the sweetsation line."
8897,1,"Vitamin and Mineral Supplement Helps Slow Hair Loss_I&#8217;m 50 years old and for the past few years have noticed that my hair isn&#8217;t as thick and luxurious as it once was. I&#8217;ve noticed a bit of thinning across my temple area and more than normal hair loss whenever I brush, comb or wash my hair.I researched Amazon for products that could be used to help slow the hair loss and possibly stimulate new hair growth. I found a listing for the Hair Maxx hair growth supplement from Ultra Labs. They also make a Hair Solace Shampoo and Hair Surge Conditioner which, used along with the supplement, could be part of a comprehensive hair growth stimulating beauty regime.The supplement comes in a bottle of 60 tablets. The package directions recommend taking 2 tablets per day. I take my daily does first thing in the morning as I&#8217;m waiting for my coffee to brew.The Hair Maxx Supplement contains a blend of over 20 vitamins and minerals that work together to help strengthen hair from the inside out. This blend of ingredients may help slow hair loss if used on a regular basis.Ingredients in the hair supplement include niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, biotin and pantothenic acid. B vitamins, such as the ones found in the Hair Maxx Supplement, are reputed to prevent premature graying and slow excessive shedding of hair.My hair appears to be shedding less now that I&#8217;m using the supplement on a regular basis. I haven&#8217;t seen any new hair growth, but that could be due to the fact that I&#8217;ve just started using the supplement. The package directions say to use for a minimum of 90 days for best results. I plan to continue using the Hair Maxx Supplement from Ultra Labs."
1314,1,"Great!_I love this stuff, it really is easy makeup to use. I use this everyday. I would buy this product again."
8651,1,great stuff!!_I bought this on a recomendation from my dentist.  I really am impressed.  It also whitens your teeth.  thanks again.
4393,1,Big difference_My last trip to the hair dresser she was could see a difference in my hair. It grew and was so much thicker. My edges are also growing back in.
2369,1,"Leaves other peels in the dust!_I've done all the peels - glycolic, lactic, salicylic with HQ - trying to get rid of sun damage and hyperpigmentation. All improved the overall look of my skin, but I still had brown blotches on my cheeks, forehead and nose. The ones on my cheeks were dark, and were very difficult to hide, even with heavy makeup, they showed through.After a few months of progressively stronger peels, I decided to try TCA. Since I already was a peel veteran, I went with the 20% instead of the lighter concentrations.The first application was a little startling - this stuff is STRONG! I stood it for a couple of minutes then washed with lots and lots of cold water. When I used a fluffy hand towel to pat dry, it felt coarse and sandpapery against my skin, which was exceedingly tender. I gave up and let it dry a couple of minutes on its own, then put on a thick layer of generic Neosporin.Over the next couple of days, my skin went from shocked white to pink, then back to white, but it was like a thin, dry leather over my face. When I talked or smiled, it cracked. I stopped the Neosporin at that point, and needed something heavy and greasy to take its place, so i whipped up an ointment from beeswax and olive oil, and used that.After about 5 days, the peeling started. I didn't peel in sheets; it was more like my skin 'crumbled' off. Gross. But worth it.After a week, the peeling was complete, my skin was much, much smoother and accepting of moisturizer. The blotches were definitely lighter in color, and breaking up. After two weeks, my skin was noticeably younger looking. the blotches were there, but now it was possible to hide them with concealer and makeup, without that telltale gray shadow that other melasma sufferers know all too well. And lines? This stuff has them running scared.The first peel did cause a few pimples along my jawline and one high on my cheek, but a dot of benzoyl peroxide helped that. I understand that it's common to sprout a few zits on the first peel. The second time, no pimples. I'm two peels into my bottle now, and doing a third in a week or so. I think that by the end of this bottle, I'll be able to go without makeup altogether and not give it a second thought. The spots are faded to almost nothing. This peel works!Be sure to protect your lip skin, the creases of your nose and your eyelids - I used Vaseline - before you apply the peel. And last but definitely not least - use sun protection of at least SPF 30 from here on out! If you can't commit to using sunblock religiously, meaning daily, rain or shine, don't bother with the pain and expense of any peel.Update - 6/4/2012I have continued with the peels, about once every 2 months, and still have over half a bottle left! I have started using Dr. Pickart's Protect & Restore copper peptide cream, and have started using the TCA as a treatment for hairline scars. I have one on my upper lip in the shape of a V. Last week I used a fine eyeliner brush to paint the hairline scar with TCA, using a magnifying glass to be a precise as possible. No where else - just in the hairline scar. I did this twice, until I got frosting. I've been applying my P&R; cream nightly and using a sunscreen during the day. I think this technique is going to work! I can't tell just yet, but I think one side of the V has flattened out. Right now it's kind of pinkish and swollen so I won't know for a week or so if this technique will work. It's kind of a TCA cross peel but they're not icepick scars.I highly recommend TCA peels, and even more highly recommend combining them with some sort of copper peptide treatment. The difference in my skin is astonishing!"
3761,1,"Perfect!_I already had a 120 color palette from Manny, so I really wanted this one with just nude and more &#34;calm&#34; colors. They are perfect, I bought one for me and one for my friend and we are loving it. Really beautiful colors, really bright and really pigmented."
2697,1,"Vaseline Body Lotion, Aloe Fresh_Here in Phoenix we cope with year-round dry weather as best we can.  If one is fair skinned it becomes an important component of enjoying one's day to avoid scratching all day long due to dry skin.  That's me.  After trying a continual stream of hand and body lotions I am thinking this product here might be a keeper. I like this lotion:  it is creamy, mild and is not grainy like some.  It applies smoothly and covers well.  The aloe aroma is not strong so it does not linger for too long.  Time will tell but I am staying scratch-free in our long dry winter, so for now I highly recommend Vaseline Body Lotion."
581,1,Great Curling Iron_I have short hair and it is straight!  I don't look good with straight hair - must have curls.  This curling iron does the job!  Fantastic!
1098,1,"great scent_This is a pleasing scent that will have broad appeal.  I would describe it as floral with spicy overtones.  A solid choice to add to your collection.  On Amazon, surprisingly affordable.  I never had any problem with fragrances on Amazon being 'weak' or 'counterfeit.'"
3861,1,"Stayed on all night!_This lipstick was fantastic! It stayed on almost all night, even after drinking, and left a really nice, even color on my lips. It's also on the moister side, so it didn't leave me craving chapstick all night (which many other lipsticks do). Highly recommend, especially for the price!"
3882,1,"Extreme_This hair spray is the strongest I've ever used. I wouldn't recommend it for every day use, more for an up-do. I use it when styling hair for actors before theater performances. They can dance, sweat, whatever, and this stuff stays strong."
9824,1,"Great With the Vitamin C Serum_I am a fan of InstaNatural Argan Oil, and I love to use rose water toners on my skin. For about a year I have been using an excellent rose water toner by Teliaoils, a company in Greece. The downside of it was that it comes in very small bottles and takes about 2 -3 weeks to ship. I decided to try InstaNatural Rose Water because it ships fast and comes in a larger bottle; also as I said I use and highly recommend their argan oil.This toner is fantastic to use with the argan oil! It is lightly moisturizing, smells like rose petals and leaves my skin feeling just like a rose petal. I have also swiped it beneath and over my eyes and it is very soothing, not irritating at all - this coming from someone with extremely sensitive eyes and skin. It is great used in conjunction with InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum and argan or rosehip oil, as the serum tends to be a bit drying. This toner and the oils provide proper moisturization to counterbalance the slightly drying effect of the serum. I have not yet tried their rosehip oil as I am still using up the bottle of Teliaoils rosehip oil I have, but will be happy to order some when I run out. But definitely use this as a toner before moisturizing even if you don't use the serum!I am excited about this new company and its products; all that I have tried so far have been top-notch quality, fresh, non-allergenic (for me) and the prices are incredibly reasonable. Customer service is above-and-beyond as well; in fact part of the reason I was willing to give them a shot is because of their gracious responses to the few folks who've reviewed negatively. Highest recommendation!"
7834,1,"E.L.F little black beauty box_For the price this little book is pretty awesome. The colors are really nice, I'm always a sucker for a nice container and the look of it closed is adorable. really good buy."
168,1,"Don't Be Fooled By The Price_Great exfoliation!When first applied, your face will feel chilled -- very cool and refreshingIt really pulls everything out of your pores which I guess is why the pores seem to shrink.Interestingly, despite the fact it pulls up excess oils, it doesn't dry out your skinA very win win product"
1100,1,"Beautiful scent and bottle, overpriced but sweet scent_If it were affordable I would say ten stars!  I have to cut back on a star due to the price. You can find this at drug store, wallys etc but it's pricey for me anyhow.It is a perfect scent if you like sweet but not gag-you-sweet.  There are knockoffs of this at the dollar store and if you like that, but want something a little smoother, get Spears' perfume.  It's light but noticable.I usually end up washing perfume off.  I hate ultra strong or asian inspired scents or too fruity or too musky :)  I love this perfume because it's lovely.  A very girly/womanly scent without being overpowering.My niece and I tried it on at JC Penny and kept smelling our wrists, going on and on about how wonderful the scent was.  I plan to buy her a bottle for her birthday. If it was cheaper, I'd get some for myself!Normally I wear Bath and Body's Noel Christmas scent or their cotton scent.  I also love original Chloe but again..lol..too much money for perfume.**Edit: I have to admit I love a bargain..hoping that you do too, I found the 'copy cat' scent at most Dollar Tree stores to be even better!  That's right..better.  I have five bottles of it, I even use it as an air scent in my bedroom!  I did buy the original, real Fantasy for my niece for Christmas, and compared the two a few times.  No kidding, the dollar store knock-off version is even better! Woohoo!!!"
4018,1,"AMAZING!!_This stuff is AMAZING!!!  It will take off the most stubborn make up.  It is great for sensitive skin and doesn't burn or even tingle when it gets in your eyes!  It may seem pricey, but 500 ml go a long way.  I will definitely re-purchase this product!!!"
1695,1,"Smells like sunblock_Smells like sunblock which isn't great but isn't awful either.  Gives a light cover, not heavy, but I also use cover-up in addition so this foundation is fine."
4884,1,"Best My Hair Has Ever Had!!!_I like to color my hair on a regular basis, however after years of processing my hair, it became dull, dry, and hard to manage.I had tried lots of high end hair care products with minimal results.When I found this one for almost $20.00 at a local super center, I figured what the hell... and gave it a try. The scent was what drew me in initially, with a very gorgeous musky fragrance that is both thick yet light.I hoped the scent would stay, if anything.Instead of just a lovely scented scalp, I was left with the best results any conditioner has ever given me before. Biolage Hydratherapie Conditioning Balm by Matrix literally transformed my dull and dry damaged hair into hair that did not even feel like it was my own! My hair was left shiny, manageable, full of healthy moisture, and it was soft and silky. No frizz, no puff.All in all, this one is now the only conditioner I will buy. It was sooo worth the splurge as I would have spent far more on cheap products trying to achieve the same results."
9891,1,"excellent brush!_Love love love this brush!! It fits in your hand perfectly, glides through hair easily and if you do have some gnarly knots you can work them out pretty quickly and there's minimal pulling. Seriously in love with this brush, it feels pretty great against your scalp too!"
2961,1,"Great Razor but Doesn't Live up to Claims_While this is a wonderful razor, it does claim to have an all in one experience so that the user doesn't need shaving cream.  The gel bars are a nice feature but they didn't eliminate the need for soap or shaving cream to prevent nicks.  I got a few nicks and I rarely do so when I shave with just a bit of baby wash and a Silky Effects razor.  I was being careful as well, not trying to test out how well it could do with careless shaving.The shape of the razor does allow for a closer shave which I appreciate.  Plus, it has a wide head which allows for more surface area and less sweeps to be made."
6620,1,"Love the feel and smell_Great product for the price, light feel and atractive smell, good for curly and straight hair, I use after my WEN, perfect combo."
8522,1,"Is Tresemme the best drugstore brand?_I have tried several new Tresemme products lately and all have been exceptional. I don't know what they've been up to lately but I remember back when they first started a long time ago, I swore I'd never buy this brand again. They've done a complete 180 degree turn around.This is yet another fantastic Tresemme product in the new lineup.I spray this on before I blow out my hair, and it gives my hair body, volume, shine and smoothness better than anything else. I like the trigger pump spray bottle, the large size and low price, and most of all, the way my hair looks when I use this.There are times when I flat iron my hair, and I get nervous when I see the smoke coming off my hair, although my stylist assures me it is steam. I would never do that without something like this to add protection. This makes my hair soft smooth and silky, and the straight style resists humidity and frizz after ironing. If you iron your hair and want to give it protection from heat, look no further than this. It is excellent."
4176,1,"Good Packaging!_Very good packaging! I really like how this palette is able to slide! Saves a lot of space! With 96 different shades, I can create many looks! Perfect for a gift! This is the eye shadow palette you will ever need! :) Plus, it is affordable!"
5021,1,"Great product_These replacement heads work very well.  They are not too hard and not so soft that they are ineffective.  They don't fray or come loose from the base.  I replace mine every three months, but during the time in use they rinse clean very easily and don't hold any sort of odor.  I've used this and Clarisonic's facial brush, and for my money I prefer the Olay system because it does the exact thing as the Clarisonic, the smaller heads allow easier access around the nose, the cost can't be beat."
312,1,best shampoo/conditioner I've ever used._I was looking to a good natural alternative to shampoo and this is way better than I could have expected. My hair is thicker than its ever been and I don't need a conditioner to make it soft. I will use this stuff forever!
8502,1,"Works Amazingly Well._I had heard of dry shampoos before. I used to think about using one as a way to get some of the road dust and 'shumtz' out of my hair during periods that washing my hair was difficult or just impossible. The problem was they all seemed to be made for a clinical environment and from what I heard, they smelled like it too. This Axe Waterless Dry Shampoo Foam Reset is not your grandma's waterless shampoo. It goes on easy, lifts the dirt and oils out and leaves my hair with that great Axe smell. This is just what I was looking for."
9557,1,"He's Gellin'_My brother has been using this gel. He is between cuts and his hair was looking messy but not in a good way. This gel is somewhat thin but applies easily to damp hair. The scent is pleasant. Initially it is strong but it does tend to diminish. The gel provides moderate hold that does seem to last. His hair is not sticky and it looks effortlessly styled. But the best part is the total absence of flakes. He swore off styling products because of flakiness and residue. This one washes out easily. If like my brother, you are looking for a product that provides moderate hold without stiffness and stickiness and is flake free, this styling gel is a good choice. Recommended."
8152,1,"Wasn't bad, but wouldn't buy it again.._This costs MUCH less on Amazon than at Sephora, so that's a plus. The mask was nice; I think it did tighten up some pores for a few hours directly after the treatment but I don't think it was helpful enough to justify the price. I used it 1-3 times a week for 5ish weeks (until it ran out).I am going to try a different version of GlamGlow in case this just wasn't ideal for my skin type. I think I had too high of expectations because of the glowing (har, har) reviews."
7819,1,Does what it says_I bought this to clean my brush set I purchased. I tested it out on a brush with black eyeliner on it and it works perfectly.
3705,1,"Good towel, although hair does not look any healthier._This has been a good hair towel, it is easy to use and soaks up a lot of moisture. I don't know if I am sold yet on microfiber, I know it is suppose to be better for your hair, but I haven't noticed reduced frizz or breakage or anything like that, but I will continue to use this hair towel because it is so convenient!"
6958,1,Nice_Takes alot to put foundation on with this. I rather use it for powder. Maybe blush but Still like it. It does use alot of soap to wash all the makeup away. Thats the down side but real soft and worth the money.
9708,1,"excellent hair mask_My hair is damaged from the sun and surf.  I swim in both the ocean and the pool, and my hair has been stressed by bleach.  I was really surprised to discover this product really worked to restore shine and softness to my damaged hair.  It did much better than I expected.  I did keep it on longer than directed (10 minutes instead of 3 minutes).It did not bother my sensitive skin. This mask has a nice scent too.  I will use it again."
8024,1,"pretty color_This blush offers a nice warm pink color.  I like the applicator on this one, it is soft yet firm enough to apply evenly."
2167,1,"Works for my oily face!_Edit: 1/16/2012I've enjoyed this mascara for some time, but I find that it uncurls my lashes. I have very long, straight lashes that point downward. Once I curl and apply this, my lashes become straight again. Covergirl lash blast does not give me this problem.*********************I have the oiliest face so waterproof and smudge-proof mascara never worked for me. This is the only thing that works. No, it isn't as bold as other mascaras, but it does lengthen and add a bit of volume for me. I've also had one or two tubes come off throughout the day, but I just got this mascara a week ago so I don't think I've perfected application yet. I was stuck with clear mascaras for years. I'm really glad this works!"
266,1,Used in salons_I looked for this after having a pedicure in a salon and writing down the name of the color and product used. I received and it is great.
1755,1,"Great Face Cleanser_In essence, the Wave is a pore cleaner that works by gently vibrating your skin to shake loose the contents of your pores. This is NOT meant to be an exfoliator or toner. It does its job exceedingly well, which surprised me. I have tested many, many skin care products over the years, and was quite cynical about this one working. Really, it does.First, the theory. Your face is full of pores - i.e. holes that go downward into your skin. Dirt, sweat, make-up and other junk gets stuck in those holes. That is what forms blemishes. The more dirt and such you have in your pores, the more they are 'pushed open' and the bigger they look. Keeping them as clean as possible also makes them as small as possible, so your skin has a smoother overall look.This small handheld device lets you attach a pad to the face of it, then you moisten that pad to get the soap going. It isn't a 'big foaming' soap, it's a very subtle one. Again, the aim is not to cover your face with foam. It's for the vibrations to get the small amount of gentle foam down into your pores. Pores are small :) You hold that vibration on one spot, to vibrate open the pores beneath the device. You don't want to 'drag' the wave, like you would with an exfoliant. The aim is not to drag the pores open. It is to shake them up gently to loosen their contents, so that the washing stage gets those contents out of your skin. So you put the wave onto various parts of your skin, in order to do that. Then you rinse the junk all free. If anything your aim is to open the pores as little as possible, so that once the junk is shaken out of them, they can close up to a small size.So that this process doesn't take all day, the wave face is relatively large - about the size of a half dollar. This is good in the sense that you can do your entire face in under 10 minutes, but bad in the sense that it doesn't fit well in those big-pore areas along the nose. I understand this was a tough compromise for them to make. If they'd made the unit smaller, people would complain about how long it took them to get their entire face done.I like how easily the pads go on and off the sticky face, but it seems really odd to me the pads come in a non resealable foil pouch. There's no way at all to even 'fold over the top' to keep them moist! That's a pretty simple fix for them to have made. That being said, there's really no way I'm going to go out and eternally buy pads for a device. I would just use cotton balls with my own Neutrogena acne soap (which I use daily and *love*). This would get me my favorite soap option along with the pore-cleansing capabilities of this device.I really do find that this shakes loose dirt that normal cleaning cannot get to. My pores look much cleaner and smaller after using this device. I have no doubt that using this is gentle on your skin - I have rosacea and acne and my face will definitely flare if something bothers it. I haven't had any problems with this. I wonder though if most people will have the patience to use this properly. It's not a quick-use device. The whole way it works is to work section by section, shaking loose the dirt, cleaning out the pores in that one spot. I think most people want to do a quick pass with soap or exfoliant or whatever and get on with their life.It's one of those investment things. If you invest the time to keep your skin clear and healthy, it will reward you by looking wonderful and doing its job of keeping you safe from germs. If you want a quick-fix to just soap off the outer layer of grime - or exfoliate off the outer layer of skin - you won't get the same results. So I highly recommend this as something which does take time to use, but you might be surprised at just how much better your pores are if you do invest that time and effort.My only complaints are about the pads, and like I said, there's a solution for that."
9714,1,It works!_Will buy again. Just like a b.b. cream. When I wear it I don't need foundation. You can use at night but I prefer day. Would make a great base. Amust have!
8911,1,loveeee!_THESE NYX BUTTER GLOSSES ARE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING !! THEY ARE SO PIGMETNED AND SMEEL REALLY GOOD. GREAT OVERTOP ANY LIPSTICK AND SUPER SHINY !!!!I ACTUALLY DO YOUTUBE MAKEUP VIDS (kimkreations p) AND I LITERALLY USE ADLEAST ONE OF THESE EACH TIME ! I HAVE THEM IN ALL THE COLORS !!
930,0,Its ok_I have mixed feelings about this. Its ok. I'm not in love with it. I don't like how it makes my hair feel. Like it has a residue on it or something.
7618,1,Great Mirror!_Bought this for a son to use in shower. Liked the price and the reviews and he says it works great!
3116,1,"Great value and quality!_This is a great value for the amount of lotion you get. The Lemon Sugar smells just like it sounds, like lemon candy. The pump is great, the lotion hasn't clogged it yet. It's not overly thick nor is it watery. If you've ever used Suave lotion, it's a little thicker than that. Doesn't seem very moisturizing but it cleared up my rough elbows with a few weeks of continuous use. It isn't sticky and absorbs quickly. I'm a user for life."
3220,1,Worth every penny_I love OPI products and this is no exception. I only need a little to go a long way and I don't have to worry about it overdrying my cuticles or not getting all the polish.  Enjoy!
6790,1,Works As A Womangroomer As Well_This is a nice hairdryer for anyone and I'm not sure why it is called a Mangroomer.  I am guessing it is just a marketing gimmick like the current Dr. Pepper 10 campaign aimed at males.  Anyway I used the high fan speed and the medium heat and this setting was perfect to dry the hair quickly without any discomfort from it being too hot.  There is a Cold Shot button that turns off the heat I think to set your final hair style.  I did test it and the heat did indeed go on and off.  There is also an ionization button that has a beautiful blue LED light to indicate it is on.  I have to admit I don't understand much about ionization and we've never had much problem with static electricity but I suppose it is a nice feature to have.  Maybe I will use the extra features in the future but for now I can report this hairdryer seems to have the perfect air speed and temperature to dry my hair quickly and comfortably.
5574,1,"very good result_my son was suffering with acne last 4 years . He used everything and only anibiotics were some help . After he started taking this - for 5 weeks we did not see much result-  but now it got better - much better-  he takes 2 pills am and pm- total 4 pills . and flax oil . But still skin is not perfect so far, but I am ordering again to keep going ."
4141,1,"good product_SHANY Makeup set - Eyeshades, blush, lip gloss, mascara. My sister loves it. I actually brought this for my use; however my sister fell in love with it and has taken full control of it. She love the variety of colors, the mascara isn't a quality one and smudges a lot so she does not make use of it. The lip colors aren't too bright but they are ok for lip gloss. As for the blush well I don't use them so I can give a review on them. Good product though."
5344,1,"Oh, So Fine!_I love loose powder because I think it makes a nicer finish than pressed powder.  I've always used flesh-toned products until I bought this, which I purchased in yellow.I decided to try yellow because I have rosacea, which you can see like a ring around my neck in my profile picture.  My cheeks and nose are completely covered with it.  Fortunately, I don't have the cystic form, but there's not enough concealer in the world to cover it.  I look for foundations and powders that have a yellowish tone to make my complexion appear more even, but never tried a yellow powder before.I was awestruck, gobsmacked, and utterly confounded when I first applied this powder.  It did not turn my blush orange as I was afraid it might.  No, it's impossible to tell I'm wearing a yellow-colored powder.  In fact, it's hard to tell I'm wearing powder at all!I do my foundation first, then powder, using a powder brush.  Then I do eyes, cheeks, and lips.  I can see this powder on my skin when I apply it, but by the time I finish the rest of my makeup, I just can't see it.  It seems to vanish.It minimizes the appearance of pores, evens skin tone, and sets foundation better than any powder I've ever used.  The package says the yellow has shimmer, but it absolutely does not.  The finish is matte, but not chalky.  Incredibly, it even makes it look like I'm wearing less foundation than I am.  Actually, I'm using a little less foundation because of this powder, because I prefer a more natural look.I keep this on my vanity, a flat, level surface.  Before I apply it, I shake the container gently from side to side.  Never up-and-down, because that will fluff the powder and it will float out all over the place when I open the container.  A little side to side shake pushes a bit through the screen, and only a bit is necessary.  I don't have problems with loose powder messes because I always do this.  If at first a mess is unavoidable, I simply shake a bit of the powder into the trash can.  It may seem like a waste, but it's when the container is full that powder explosions are most likely to happen.  It's easier to dump a little bit than struggle with what's going to get wasted through spillage, anyway, plus it saves time if you don't have to clean up a mess.  I haven't had a mess problem with this powder; just thought I'd throw that out there.I find this product amazing, with a price to match.  Therefore, I'm giving it the HB stamp of Best Buys on Amazon."
530,1,"AMAZING PRODUCT!_I have rarely used a product one time and seen results. This is amazing! My skin is so soft and after two uses, my pores look so much smaller. There is a small amount of smell that does dissipate, however, the results are well worth it! Highly Recommend! Thanks!"
9391,1,"This Did Wonders for My Skin_What a wonderful product!I have had skin issues for years since I was a teenager... everything from overly oily skin to blackheads and whiteheads that pop up often and during the most inopportune times. I got the Salicylic Acid Peel Serum to try and manage my skin better after it was recommended to me and I have to say that it did an excellent job of clearing up my skin and keeping it smooth, rejuvenated and fresh looking. I've been using it for about two months now and in that time my skin quickly went from a problematic oily/broken-out state to a wondrously clean and fabulous complexion.What I like about the product is that it is easy to use and keeps my skin looking great for weeks on end before I use it again. The serum solution is incredibly gentle (which I have had issues in the past with other as my skin can be sensitive to overly abrasive products) but effective at doing everything from removing excess oil from the skin to cleaning off dead skin cells and helping to prevent break outs (which were one of my worst skin issues). Overall, I'm really glad I got this and will definitely continue to use it as I don't think my skin has looked quite this healthy or fresh and clean in years."
5159,1,i thought I bought the corrector_I thought I bought the corrector- but my mistake- i do use it occassionally not on a regular basis like the correcot which I love.
4252,1,"Surprisingly good.  Probably best travel soap._These PH skin friendly soaps haven't usually been my favorite.  I tried using the Cetaphil brand for a while, but gave up on it because it didn't do any better at cleaning my face than just plain water does, though it never dried out my face.  Then I tried the Purpose brand which is better at cleaning off dirt but leaves my face a bit dry.  Then I got this and wow-  I get the cleanliness I got from the purpose brand along with the moisture retention of the Cetaphil brand.  And it has a really nice scent to it to boot! Fresh and not overpowering.  Kind of smells like aloe.  I use this not only to wash my face but also my hands.  I haven't used it as a body wash yet, but I will this summer when I go camping.  It'll be so convenient to have an all in one soap for traveling."
7753,1,"No more salon appointments_Really like the package, a good start.  I didn't care for the polish remover wraps, tricky to get on and then keep on (using one hand is difficult).  I'm happy to do my own nails."
5614,1,Best one I've found_I have tried many different sunscreens.  This is my favorite.  I've bought it twice from amazon.  It doesn't leave me white like other brands.  I like this for SPF 50 and Keys sunscreen for SPF 30.
7879,1,love the weight and color_I like how light the pin is and it's the same as the picture . got my item way before it was suppose to arrive and guess I could use this for Christmas now
892,1,"Perfect size, easy to melt_What I like about this product is the wax is little pellets. Each bag is 1 lb (I believe) so you don't have to put it all in at once nor do you put in a huge block. The wax melts fairly quickly, the only time it doesn't is after I've topped off the wax and the level is higher. The lavender scent isn't overpowering at all and it's pretty moisturizing.I tend to use it before bedtime. I put foot stuff on my feet, dip my feet twice-ish in the paraffin. I then wrap my feet in plastic wrap, put on big fuzzy socks, and hunker with a glass of wine and watch TV with my husband. Having the wax on your feet also ensures you don't have to get up to get your own refills.This was the first wax I purchased when I got my paraffin bath and it's the only wax I've purchased. I've used wax at the salon and this seems equal to or better than that."
6721,1,"Good stuff with a great price._First off I have to say I'm fond of the smell, this worked great for me and was for a reasonable price so no complaints on my end."
6127,1,Good variety of colors_Haven't used this yet but there is a good variety of color.  The container does a good job if keeping each color in its own compartment.
8618,1,"Not too thick, not too thin with simple and light scent_I've recently tried two Nexxus conditioners and although this one meets my preference with it's lighter and less sweet scent, I like what theNexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner, 13.5 Ouncedoes to my hair more than thisNexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 13.5 Ounce.  My short, thin hair has a tendency to fall flat when conditioned with a heavier product and despite the 'Weightless' name, it's a little flatter with this product.  The cream isn't as thick as the other variety, but as with the other, a very small amount is needed and it is very soluble so that it coats the hair with ease.  It also rinses out with no problem and leaves the hair feeling soft and smooth.  It's actually softer than with the Youth Renewal variety.  The bottle is the same shape which fits comfortably in the hand and the cap dispenses the cream easily.  I did notice that this particular bottle was not filled as much as the other and I'm not sure if this is typical of the product.  It's a good conditioner but not my favorite of the two."
5215,1,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this!_I got this on recommendation for pre cleaning before using the Baiden mitten. I'm not sure how much it really makes a difference over just using my old neutrogena (the main point is you can't have a soap that leaves any residue or it won't work). My neutrogena and plain old Ivory both left no residue. Not sure if this Moroccan Black Soap enables MORE exfoliation than they would or what else it might do, but the smell simply puts me in HEAVEN.I love the texture, I lightly spread some on my buff puff and wash my face etc. with it and I simply can not get ENOUGH of this scent!  It's just a heady mix of eucalyptus and maybe some smoky wood, who knows what else, but I'm crazy for it!I feel like maybe it does something more than clean without residue, I don't know what, maybe it's 'good' for my skin in some healthful way beyond other soaps, I don't know. But I just plain love it. It really adds an element of spa-like aroma delight to my shower experience."
2800,1,"Pleasant scent -makes your skin feel like butter!!_Olay did good with this body wash...so good that I actually feel like I am pampering myself with this body wash when I use it in the shower. I'll give you the low down: it has a nice thick consistency that is creamy and not at all runny. The scent is pleasing, such that it is enough for you to notice it but certainly not overpowering or gag worthy. It also smoothes on your skin very nicely and actually feels good being slathered on your skin. Another plus is that you don't need that much of it to do the job, a little goes a long way and if you use too much you may need to take extra time to wash it all off as it does produce a nice strong lather.The only real con for me is that it can build up and leave a light film on your shower or bathtub floor. This is of course no problem if you are one of the diligent people that sprays down their shower after every other use. But for my fellow friends in the lazy club that don't clean the shower that frequently, the film can bother you a bit, which is why this body wash only gets four stars from me. Still, I don't find that it makes the shower floor slippery or dangerous, just a bit filmy. And the film residue left behind on the shower floor does motivate me to clean the bathroom a bit more frequently, which I guess is a win-win? Anyhow, this Olay body wash does make my skin feel nice and soft, so I keep going back it!"
600,1,"works well, better if you also use their lactose intolerence pill_this is a good product, I did not have good results with prescription medication for ibs, this works better, is less expensive and no prescription is needed, I added the lactose intolerance pills after getting a free sample in the mail and the combination keeps me almost symptom free (my symptoms were moderate to severe)"
1602,1,"The Only Eye Liner I've Used for Years_Seriously. I'm 28 now. I've been using this since I was 15. I've tried others, but always come back. I like how this easily applies, not too dark, not too light. I also like how it comes off when you need it to. The smudge sponge at the end is nice, though I just use my fingers. It's ze best!"
9803,1,"Formulated for optimum results_I am a vitamin C serum addict. I love natural beauty products that work and I've tried several Vitamin C serums. InstaNaturals was the first to introduce me to Ferulic Acid. I had to look it up.'If added to a topical preparation of ascorbic acid and vitamin E, ferulic acid may reduce oxidative stress and formation of thymine dimers in skin.'What all that means is that ferulic acid shows great promise in warding off the free radicals that cause DNA damage, cancer, and accelerated cell aging. Wow! What a great addition!After more research on Vitamin C serums I've found that this InstaNatural formula contains all of the ingredients necessary for optimum results with Vitamin C. No fillers, nothing extra. Only what my skin needs and what the product needs to keep it stable and fresh. Love, love, love it!I received a free sample of this product for review. This is my honest opinion of InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum."
9808,1,"Wow!_Winter is finally over and my skin had become very dry and rough. I also have been having some stress issue, so when I was offered  this product I thought &#34;what the heck&#34; and decided to give it a try.I am so glad I did.  The aroma is soothing without being cloying and it is just oily enough to make my skin feel ever so much better.  The added benefit id that it f truly did relax me and I was finally able to get a good nights sleep after using this product. I used it in my tub, but I am also using it as a rub for my legs and arms - another  extra benefit  to this product is that you can use it  both ways.The smell is just light enough not to interfere with other colognes or toilette water that you may be using, but I sure would love it if this company started making their own after bath body spray to match the scents!"
8603,1,"I prefer the liquid_I was not a big fan of this foam soap. It had a very nice smell and likely kills more bacteria than most standard liquid soaps, but I prefer the liquid. This would probably be the kind of stuff you put out in a guest bathroom or for the holidays when you have company over. In my opinion this is more of a high end soap for special times than something I would use every day. It may just be me, but I prefer the cheap stuff. This one just feels fancy to me."
2197,1,I love this oil!_Yes I do really love this oil..It's aroma is of sweet rosemary..I use it on my hair..smells wonderful..gives my scalp a gentle tingle.
7860,1,"Great organizer!_This item is actually better quality than I had figured. I did have to cut some of the top row sliders open, because they were sealed shut, but afterwards, it works great. Very sturdy, and it holds a LOT of plates!"
668,1,"sheal butter_I only use this product on my face in the winter months, it keeps my face and neck moisturized, but I use it on my 4 yr old son all year long to help heal all of his scraps and scars and I love this product. I will be buying more."
7341,1,"not natural, shiny, thick band but still love them_First of all i just wanted to say I uploaded a photo so anyone interested in buying these could get a better idea of what they look like on.I had to sign for these when they arrived, which was odd lol I've been buying lashes from across the sea for over a year now and I do love them but im going to tell u right now no they don't look natural. The band is thick and noticeable, the lashes themselves are also thick and are shiny if you are looking down and getting that point of view. This is something I've encountered with all the lashes I've bought over seas, so anyone telling you oh these look natural, no its a lie. Plastic lashes are very fake looking bc of the length and shine. But just bc they don't look natural doesn't mean they aren't beautiful. I love these lashes, its my first time buying crisscross lashes and they are definitely worth the buy. If your looking for natural looking lashes these aren't the way to go, I suggest human hair lashes if your going for a full natural look since its very hard to find &#34;natural&#34; looking lashes that are plastic."
9742,1,"Better than Head and Shoulders 2 in 1_This shampoo and conditioner is fantastic.  It cleans, and washes out so that my hair feels completely clean at the end.  I didn't notice the extra moisture/ conditioner left by the Head and Shoulders 2 in 1 until I tried this brand.  I'm sold, and I was a former fanof the competition"
7322,1,"Nice_This is actually a pretty good product. I have occasional light dandruff and once a week I use a dandruff shampoo unless greater frequency is warranted.Bottom line is any product that obtains zinc pyrithione is going to be effective according to my dermatologist.  As this is a combo product which shampoos and conditions, it does a nice job.I washed my hair, let it sit on my scalp, and then rinsed it thoroughly. My hair smelled clean and looked clean. It was manageable and doesn't seem drying which is sometimes a problem for me.I give this two thumbs up and would recommend it for value, effectiveness, and convenience."
2618,1,"Nice on the hair, but could have been designed better_This is the third hair straightener that I've tried in the past year and it ranks in the middle as far as quality goes. The iron feels really nice on the hair, and it slides effortlessly down the length of my shoulder blade length hair. I love the long cord and the hanging hook. It also heats up very quickly, and I love the digital temperature readout.There are two design flaws inherent to this straightener. The on/off switch is located on the outside, right where my hand holds the iron, so I've had to adjust where I place my hand, which makes the straightener a bit uncomfortable to hold. Had the on/off/temp switch been located inside, like found in my cheaper straightener I would have considered giving the straightener another star. The other design flaw is the safety closure is very awkward to operate.I already use the Tresemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray Leave In Hair Care Conditioner 8 oz, and would highly recommend this product regardless of which straightener you choose to buy."
7459,1,"great stuff_I felt this conditioner was really great and didn't weigh my hair down. Some of the ingredients are questionable, but that is not as important with things (like conditioners, as opposed to skin cream) that stay on the scalp and hair a short time. The price is also right for this product.Susan Schenck, author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit & PlanetandBeyond Broccoli, Creating a Biologically Balanced Diet When a Vegetarian Diet Doesn't Work"
3105,1,so far so good_I have been using this for a week or so now. Have been experimenting with TCA peels & lactic acid peels. So far I really like the benefits of it on my face. Didn't do a whole lot for my hair though. Only takes a drop for the face or it will get oily. Pretty happy with it so far. Have ordered macadamia nut oil for my hair.
900,0,"I Obvioiusly Missed Something..._I purchased this hair dryer to replace an ionic dryer that I have.  It is heavier, but what bothered me is that it didn't put out the heat like my old dryer does.  Though it did fine on most of my hair (which is short and curly/wavy), I had a harder time styling my bangs and the front sides of my hair.  I usually pull them out with a dryer and round brush to make them look smoother and leave the rest of my hair curly.  Also, my hair was no less or more frizzy than my old dryer so I sent it back."
8009,1,"10 Pairs of Reusable Natural and Regular Long False Eyelashes_I really like these, they are wispy, not very thick but still thicker than my real lashes. They fit 97% of my eyelid which is perfect for me. They are the closest looking to real lashes, and can be built up just like real lashes with a few coats of mascara.... however they are a bit fragile....if you are gentile with them you can re-wear them."
315,1,"Skin-Pampering Tonic_I suppose &#34;witch hazel&#34; is &#34;witch hazel&#34;, but his one has a very pleasant aroma.  I love the way it gently removes residual traces of residue (soap, etc.) and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth."
8388,1,perfect_love love love!! would recommend to all my friends!! cant wait to do my nails and my three daughters nails!!
1115,1,"Doesnt hydrate_I use the acne complex kit and this is one of the products in the regimen. It has an odor due to the sulfur in it. Its very lightweight and dries instantly. Great for young adult skin thats oily.However, if you have normal to dry or combination skin, you will need more hydration than this lotion gives. Murad has 11 product lines. For acne prone skin, you can also use the essential c night cream which will hydrate the skin and detoxify the pores. Its anti-aging as well."
7973,1,"So fun_Magnetic nail polishes are so much fun, to begin with. And these colors are absolutely gorgeous! What a fun way to spice up plain ole' nail polish! Great deal, and product."
7743,1,"works well_I love the results gained by using this, but I feel they could lighten up or just omit some of the ingredients that are questionable."
8652,1,to be expected_some were dry some were not. since they can be refilled its not a problem. love how many tips they give. helps out to make fast corrections
249,1,"I like it_Not sure it is better than similar creams, but it is definitely not worse than others. I like that it is thick and unscented. Like the pump bottle. Not unattractive sitting out."
6521,1,"I had a photo shoot_And I actually bought this brushes along with me, it was very helpful not to have  1 brush for every shadow. :-) plus the faux leather organizer keeps the brushes in order."
1187,1,"exactly what I was looking for_I have exfoliating gloves for showering, but being that I have short arms & I am not a tiny person, there are a few areas that I wish I could reach a little better.  This is perfect for getting my back & the back part of my upper thigh area.  One side exfoliates & the other side is softer feeling.  I have only used it a few times, so I cant say how long it will last, but I can say that so far I love it!"
6816,1,Fantastic Lamp_I had been using a cheaper 18watt model. Finally decided that I should invest in a better quality lamp. I've been using this one for some time now with no issues at all. I do a lot of gel manicures and really love that the led sets each layer in 30 seconds or less. Makes my job much easier and faster.
7653,0,"Ugly_They look so tacky! the only one I have used is the black one, because all the other colors are just flashy and tacky. I don't think it was worth the money"
2068,1,Obagi is the best_I love this product and will never switch. a little goes quite a long way and it makes your skin feel refreshed after you wash it.
2462,1,"Better than glycolic, lactic acids - safe and effective_I have tried all kinds of peels, and all have been troublesome. Cure works effectively and you do not have to worry about burning your skin etc. It is very good to use if you are using retin a or tazorac and have the flakey skin issues. This will remove the flakey skin."
9783,1,"My eyelashes thank you!_I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, but boy was I in for a surprise when I found out how good this product really was.I'm the type that is very skeptical when it comes to products that claim to be great and amazing or all these other things, so you can imagine my surprise when I finally used this product and saw that it was better than I expected. My eyes popped the moment I looked into the mirror.Bombshell is a perfect name for this mascara because when I used it, I felt like a Bombshell HOTTIE! I was shocked and amazed that the brush actually glided on my eyelashes with no clumps or left over residue like most mascaras do nowadays.I typically go for a natural look because I feel it looks better on me than anything else, so originally I thought this mascara was going to be wayyyy to much for my simple little look. NOPE. It matched perfectly. My eyelashes were bigger, bolder and more beautiful than ever before. I couldn't stop looking at my eyes and neither could anyone else for that matter.Now, of course, everything always has it's cons, and yes, this mascara does BUT I don't feel the need to actually comment on anything because the pros outweigh everything.I'll be sad when my free sample runs out, but you best believe you can find me at the nearest beauty supplier standing at the checkout counter with a few more in my hand!I definitely recommend to those of you who are looking for a better mascara. You won't regret this buy!"
6563,1,"LOVE_I was skeptical of the crystal nail files for a long time, but finally decided to try them.  They are the BEST!  They work well, and leave my nails nice and smooth and perfectly shaped. I also like that you can use these in a side-to-side motion, rather than just the single-direction motion of a regular emory board."
1478,1,"Perfect for sensitive skin_I always come back to this lotion. Use it on my sensitive, acne prone skin, and it absorbs well, but is not greasy. It has a very subtle orange scent (natural). A little goes a long ways."
6905,1,"Nice conditioner for this price range_I like the bottle a lot - it's very easy to open when your hands are wet, but yet quite secure when it's closed from accidental spills.  You just push down one side and the other pops up, then it dispenses easily.The conditioner itself is white, and a thick lotion that is fragrant, but not strongly so, in my opinion.  That's always subjective but I didn't find it overwhelming.  It's fairly nondescript- it's a unisex fragrance that did linger for 24 hours, but never bothered me, it rather faded into oblivion until I found my nose close to some of my hair.  (My hair is very long.)It left my hair soft and fragrant, and not overly weighed down.  It didn't do much to smooth my hair, but it did seem to condition it well, and even after a couple of days my hair felt silky, so I don't think this is one of those moisturize now, dry it out bad later shampoos.It is nice. While it didn't weigh my hair down, it didn't exactly do much for the volume.  I've used better conditioners that were more expensive, but for this price range, it's a nice selection."
4949,1,"Favorite gelish color_This is absolutely my favorite gel color that I own. I have to stop myself from wearing it nonstop. It's a great fun summery color and I think it would look nice with any complexion. Only caveat, it does sometimes take three coats to get the right color."
4011,1,"Memories_WOW!  What memories as a teenager in the 1960s bursting with raging hormones and not knowing what to do with it all.  My father was VERY strict so I didn't do anything until MUCH later and at a respectable age.  Oh, how I loved White Shoulders.  While my father and brothers gave me Channel #5, which I didn't care for and promptly gave away because I wanted the much cheaper White Shoulders.  Makes me feel like a gypsy or a flower child.  What a thrill this is to re-experience my teenage life.  Summer time and the living is easy."
1184,1,"This stuff REALLY works_I am a 21 year old asian female with combination skin and struggle with a bit of acne and acne scars. I wasted so much money by trying out different pharmaceutical products and high end products to get rid of my acne and scars. I even tried using clarisonic but it was way too harsh on my skin so I had to return it. This product was recommended to me by my boyfriend; he told me that when he was getting his skin treated in Korea, the clinic used this same serum brand for his skin. (they used the advanced one but that seemed too harsh for my skin) After two days I definitely saw a difference. My skin felt like it was glowing. I never knew what people meant when they said their skin glowed, but now I think I know! After over a week of using this product, my acne scars have lightened, giving me hope that if I continue using this, it will definitely give me clear skin.It is important that you do not use more than 3 drops because this is very acidic, it will irritate your skin. I like to mix three drops of this with my SK-II treatment essence and apply it with my fingers, tapping it until it feels like it is absorbed.Bottom line, I highly recommend it."
7128,1,"Great product_I love this product, it makes my hair look AND smell great.  I was able to save nearly half off of what the beauty shop wanted to charge me.  This item shipped quickly!"
7975,1,Magnetic!_true to what they say! and also they come with different designs which is awesome! not like other brands where its just one.. these colors pop! and the designs are pretty cool and you can't beat that price! get while you can!
3018,1,"Great, smudge-free liner_OMG! Great alternative to my MAC liner. I would purchase again. I love it because it goes on smoothly and doesn't smear like MAC."
3323,1,nice coverage_it's great coverage but doesn't last all day on me..even with a primer. I do love that it covers.... on pictures if too muchis used it can make you look washed out a bit.... I use it for highlighting mostly under my eyearea.... not to cover up blemishes or anything of that sort.
8293,1,"For Soft, Clean Hair_My Hair Type: Long, Thick, Curly, Frizzy and DryNormal Hair Care: Wash every other day, no blow dryerThe shampoo:-----------Texture: Nice, creamy- almost like hand creamScent: Light, sweet, almost perfume-y, very feminineResults: I only needed to use a little bit and it lathered up a lot. It rinsed out easily and left my hair very soft and a little shiny. My curls and frizz were at their normal level though and I had to use an anti-frizz cream when it dried."
4819,1,Best gel polish on the market_This polish is what they were using in the salon when i went to have my nails done every 3 weeks. I then decided I could do this at home myself and purchased the items needed. Best decision ever and easy to use. You do not need an expensive LED lamp to cure the gel. I purchased a 36 watt lamp for around $45 and it works great. This polish is awesome!!
9762,1,"The absolute best serum I've tried!_One of the first things I noticed about this product was that it said &#8220;Professional Moisturizing Serum&#8221; and that it has High and Low Molecular weight. That intrigued me, so I saw that the low and high molecular weights actually help the product to work better and increase the penetration of hydration.I&#8217;ve tried other hyaluronic acid serums before, but this is the only one I&#8217;ve seen that has the high and low molecular weights. It&#8217;s also the thickest formula I&#8217;ve seen yet. I was quite amazed at how thick the product was, and yet how incredibly fast it absorbed into my skin; it was almost instantaneous.I only needed a few of the thick drops to cover my face and it absorbed very fast. It also left absolutely no residue or greasy feeling to my skin. It actually worked incredibly well at hydrating my skin and left my face feeling softer.Another thing I noticed about this product is that it felt very nice and cool and I almost want to say &#8220;tingly&#8221; when it smoothed on my face. It felt very nice. I had no problems using other products on my face and it works perfect under makeup.I think this is my new favorite serum! I use it twice a day and have noticed such a great improvement in my skins overall appearance. I&#8217;m very happy with this product!"
7954,1,"Wide Awake_The fragrance of this body wash is invigorating!  It cleans wonderfully!  Does the job!It is a great way to start the day, washing your face with this will definitely get you woke up.  It starts with a tingly feeling on your skin.  I don't know how it does that but it does.  I was almost afraid it might burn...but it didn't.  Just tingly.  Kind of makes your face feel stretched a bit...if that makes sense.  Not dry, just toned and less wrinkles. :)"
6203,1,"favorite oil_This is my favorite oil.  Great for OCM (rates 0 on pore clogging scale)Fantastic for hair (loaded with ceramides)  I use occasionally as a pre shampoo treatment, and other times as a frizz serum.  Just 2 drops makes hair shiny and manageble.Seller has a really good product.  I buy a lot of oils from Dr Adorable and have been pleased with all."
6542,1,"Real Quality_These lipsticks are so fun to experiment with. The red color helps me pull of a vintage look and makes me have a lot of confidence because it ties off the look I'm trying to accomplish! 12 colors makes it easy to choose to match with certain looks. Very good quality, and it lasts a while!"
2775,1,"a nice facial mask_I really love Alba products and have many of them. I trust the brand and their products don't irritate my skin and they always smell really good! I  don't usually use facial masks but decided to treat myself. I loved it. It leaves my skin really soft and feeling firm and tight but not like dried out tight, really soft. I only use it about once or twice a week. You need to use more than if you were just putting on moisturizer but not too much and so its going to last awhile even though its a small jar. I will purchase it again."
2797,1,"Best cream out there for DRY and SENSITIVE skin, regardless of age_I have had dry skin since I was a teenager. Strange as it seems. I have tried everything, mostly clean and clear stuff which I later discovered to be better off for oily skin.What I have noticed is that Aveeno is better for dry skin and Clean and Clear is for oily skin..just throwing it out there.Aveeno though is too pricey for me, I use this product everytime I get out of the shower which is normally twice a day. So you can imagine I run out pretty fast.My mom gave this jar to my dad and my dad gave it to me. I have been using it for 2-3 years now and it trumps everything ..La Mer, Revlon Eterna, Lush cosmetics (I have tried their pricey moisturizers too) or Aveeno (which is WAY too greasy and pricey for daily use). I am comfy spending my hard earned money for Olay, since my parents have been using it since I was a child, the smell brings back fond memories of my childhood.Anyway to cut it short, I have been using this since my late 20's and now im in my early 30's it is pretty good. My skin doesn't flake like it used to especially in the winter. I am very grateful for this product."
3871,1,"Smells good, good for shaving_It smells so nice. It cleans very well. And I also use this product for shaving and it seems to do a very good job. No nicks and it keeps the skin soft and smooth."
437,1,Hubby loves it_My husband uses this product not only as a skin lotion but also as hair gel.  He said it works great.
5885,0,"Do not like this product, not worth the price._I purchased this product about two months ago and have only used it once (on the first day I bought it). The texture, quality of the actual polish is great, as OPI is a great brand. However, it is hard to actually see this over ANY nail polish. The silver almost blends in as it dries. I do not think that it's worth paying for, and would recommend the black shatter over it any day."
6651,1,"best ever_I've been using the same orange Covergirl mascara for many years and decided to go for a little change this time. I will never change back. This mascara doesn't clump at all. Most new mascara makes lashes stick together, but this one spreads them out in a lovely fan--I didn't know I had so many eyelashes!I go for the waterproof mascara cuz I don't wash it off every night (I know that might be bad, but I'm lazy and don't want to do my lashes everyday. Don't judge), and while this one doesn't specifically say so, it is waterproof. You know as you go throughout the day, or when you wash your face at night, some mascara will come off the eyelashes (particularly from the tips)? Well the next morning, a quick touch-up coat will make it look just like new. I've done this many times and my eyelashes look fantastic and thick; no clumps, no spider-leg chunky flakes. It's amazing! I've gotten so many compliments on my eyelashes. I've been told they look like eyelashes you'd see in on movie stars.Highly recommended"
6184,1,Soft glowy color_Beautiful color that goes on smoothly and looks very natural on my fair skin. Only problem was it didn't seem to last and actually my foundation seemed to come off with it. This may have just been my particular foundation or skin chemistry reacting with the product. Loreal products are usually my favorite.
6528,1,"Gorgeous colors!  PICTURE IS NOT EXACT and does it no justice._These colors are outstanding.  I just received my package today and when I opened it I was pleased to see that the colors are very pigmented and rich, primarily the copper colors. In the picture it looks a bit muted but in reality the colors are more rich and less muted and grey.  The lightest copper color is actually quite like a blush champagne.  The middle, very golden and the last, very copper.  The third row are more purply and smoky then greyish as in the picture.  The greens, especially the middle one, is very rich.I have yet to see how well they last, but judging by the many buyers and reviewers of Shany Cosmetics, I doubt I'll have a problem."
3791,0,"doesn't work_i like putting this on sometimes, because it's a bit of moisturizing for my eye area, but it doesnt do anything to your lashes. the biggest favor i ever did for my eye lashes was to stop wearing mascara, because mascara is what makes lashes fall out. and most of it flakes off and leaves black spots on your under eyes during the day. i dont understand the point of wearing make up that makes you look worse instead of better!"
2528,1,"Good shampoo for the money_While I wouldn't say this shampoo provides more fullness than any other shampoo I've ever used, it truly IS a good volumizing shampoo, and it does a great job of cleaning.  My hair never feels weighed down.  The price is right."
2266,1,"Love It._I bought this a while ago, forgot about it and pulled it out the other night. I am so glad I found this mask. Sure there maybe a little burn but what you get the morning after you use this mask is the most glowy, lovely skin. It is a magical mask that is not tested on animals."
1470,1,"Good heavy moisturizer!_This is a big bottle and lasts awhile. This lotion is very moisturizing and a little goes along way. I think it works just as well if not better than some higher end lotions I have tried. This is a good staple to have around the house for when your dry skin needs a good heavy moisturizer.  If your looking for a lightweight lotion this is not it, this is very thick and really helps with dry skin."
123,1,Great for removing unwanted spots_I started using this on my elbows which were dark and this product has lightened the area well. It also removed the blemish marks on my back.  This is something I heard about through my friend at work so I searched on Amazon for it. The fragrance is pretty. This is something I will continue to buy.
93,1,"Leaves skin purified, and super soft._I enjoy this body wash. The smell is fresh and clean, and not overpowering like some Tea Tree products can be.It lathers up nicely, and did not irritate my sensitive skin. It also left my skin very soft and clean feeling, not dry."
7275,1,"Amazing Holographic!_AWESOME holo  effect with this polish!  It really shines in the sun and looks great.  My only tiny issue was the fact that it wears off pretty quick and you can't top coat it.  Oh well, it is totally worth it for the superstar sparkle."
5219,1,French Tips_I ordered these tip and they looked the way i epxected them to look.  sorry if this is not an effective review but ihavent used them yet.  I cant say anything bad about them
5216,1,"Just The Right Amount of Everything_Whenever I buy fruity and floral scents I usually don't expect them to last very long. However, I was pleasantly surprised with Ed Hardy's 'Born Wild.' I thought 'The way this smells, it's probably only going to last about 30 minutes then die down.'I was wrong!First off, the smell is amazing..it has a fruity-berry ish scent to it that makes this scent perfect during the daytime (especially during the spring or summer). It settles in nicely and keeps it scent very well.I would say it lasts about 2 or 4 hours and afterwards the smell just lingers. I don't have to reapply often maybe only once or twice a day depending on where I am going and what I will be doing.Overall this is a great everyday scent to add to my collection and I will definitely keep one in stock at ALL times."
936,1,"So easy_I just received these rollers today and couldn't wait to try them out.  I used hot rollers every day for years but stopped when I cut my hair short.  I've been growing my hair out and it't at that awkward stage where it hits right below my shoulder.  I've tried blow drying and flat ironing but my hair just keeps flipping, and not in a good way. I had good luck with hot rollers in the past so I figured I'd try them again.  After reading all of the reviews on Amazon, I decided on these hot rollers.  Yes, they are a little small.  I'd love it if they came in 1-1/4 and 1-1/2' rollers but I couldn't find anything with those exact sizes.  In any event, the overall size of the case is great.  It's very compact so it doesn't take up a lot of space on my bathroom counter and will easily fit in my gym bag.  I also like the little pouches for the wire clips.  The rollers heat up quickly.  I was afraid that I might need more rollers but i was able to make the 10 rollers work.  Granted, I only created a long bob but it was really fast and easy.  I'm not sure why people are having such issue with the wire clips.  Perhaps I'm just used to using them but I had no problem keeping the rollers in place.  I can't wait to try creating loose curls.  All in all, a great purchase at a great price."
9814,1,"Pure Argan Oil!_This is real Argan Oil. It moisturizes my skin and I can immediately tell the difference after applying it. In addition to moisturizing your skin, you can also use this for dry hair or brittle nails and it will help with those too. It's a good product and it's all natural straight from Morroco."
2632,1,"Great Soaps_I use this soap at the bathroom sink and the ingredients seem to be very good and it lasts quite a while, as well."
5654,1,"dotting pens_they are pretty cool, they are double sided which is sooo cool, they make doing your nails a little easier than using toothpicks, worth it if you love nail art"
3356,1,"Wow! Surprised!_I bought this perfume because it was cheap and Amazon recommended it to me because I love Britney Spears' perfumes. Except I think this one might be better. It stayed on for most of the day, was not overpowering, and was a sweet, youthful scent."
259,1,Great_A cute  milky pink shade! Great for delicate looks and great for those who just sometimes want to be a bit more on the lighter side. Im a huge fan of light milky colors. I love how it looks on your nails. So chic and cute
5371,1,CRAIG W_I recieved these on time and in good condition.  I love these.  I might not pay to have my nails done again.  These image plates make doing your nails fun.  They are easy to use.  I suggest using the white or black top coats with these.  The base color is your choice.I used these on my nails and loved the look. Then I loaned them to my daughter who had fun with her nails and is going to order her own set.  If your like fancy nails in a do it your self package order these.  LINDA W
7473,0,"not sure who could use this product._The product description on line that I read, doesn't mention that this is for relaxed and natural hair.  when I got the product, the container says it's for Relaxed and natural hair..  Relaxed to me means curly hair that has been chemically relaxed.  I wouldn't have got this product, had I known that.  Typically, the type of hair that gets straightened is very thick and dry, so this product could be for them.  I would still question even that though, knowing how difficult this stuff is to wash out.With no instructions with it there's no telling how exactly to use this.  As a former hairstylist, I've seen similar looking products used on straightened hair to help smooth it down with a flat iron, but  It's not advertised to use that way.It's thick and by the other reviewers seems to be very difficult them to wash out too.  Maybe similar to putting vaseline on you hair.  It says for the scalp and hair, but to even get on my scalp, it would get on my hair, so not a product for me."
7684,1,"Excellent Product_I gave this to my spouse and asked her to give me feedback after she used it so that I could write a review. She provided the following comments:The odor is very mild and not ojectionable at all.Squeeze only an amount the size of a quarter into your palm and it will be enough to do your face and neck. You will get many uses out  of one tube.It removes eye makeup which was an unexpected but welcome surprise.After using this product it is recommended that you use moisturizer.This is a five star product.OK, she is pleased. Me too."
6034,1,"A product to minimize the size of pores and primer_It arrived a bit slow., you can not trace it either.It WAS well packaged, a VERY cute box with a face profile on it.I put my moitureizer on my face first, then applied the Good-bye Pore-ever.First let me say that I am 53 years old and my pores are very small.After I applied the moisturizer, then the Good-bye Pore-ever (it is a very light, pleasent scent) l it will fade though.It went on smoothly, I did NOT find it &#34;sticky&#34; or heavy at all.The primer side of it made way for a very smoothe, soft base before applying my regular foundation.My make up looked great!  a wonderful finishi!  As far as my pores go, yes, it DID fill them in and everything looked nice, even and smooth.Would I recomend this product?  Yes, I would.  The tube is large and  you ONLY NEED A small amount so it will last A long time.Good product for the money, which is very resonable...........It just...Takes A LONG TIME TO ARRIVE.  Maybe because it is coming from the orient and has to go through customs and all other things that if bought in the USA it would not have to go through."
6924,1,Love!!!!!_Again all natural. I love all natural products. This is great. I order avocado and caster oil. The texture the packaging everything about it I love!
1448,0,"Awful_I've used rimmel products before, but this was bad! Not sure if the eyeliner itself or the shipping conditions. The packaging was ok / arrived on time but the eyeliner was not soft, kind of dry and crumbly, broke quickly as soon as I try using it no matter how gently i pressed, and broke every time I sharpened it."
8925,1,"pretty great!_before you even try out the product, toss the brush. it's too small to even be considered a full on eyeshadow brush.however, the selection of colors is pretty great. they fit all skin tones. some are shimmery, some are satin, some are matte, and there's a couple with glitter flecks. all are very pigmented and last a long time. impressive options.the blush does not go on very choppy, but it isn't as smooth as it could be. a bit of blending is necessary, but not enough to be a pain.before purchasing, i would have liked to know that the palette is split in to 2 smaller palettes. while it isn't a big deal, it bothered me that in the photo they were trying to make it look like it was one large palette.this palette set is DEFINITELY worth the price. both are small enough to fit in a purse, and contain a small thin mirror for touch ups.upon arrival, the package was not damaged in any way. it even came 2 days before i expected! needless to say, i was pleased.overall ratings:application - 6.5/10color choices - 8/10lasting ability - 7/10price - 1,000,000/10shipping - 10/10recommend? heck yes."
6446,0,"I am strugglng with this product_I have reasonably good hair, average thickness and shine, but it requires a little teasing and product to give it body and help it stay in place.  I have used Totally Baked Hair Meringue only once and I'm willing to give it another try, but it was not a good experience the first time. I used about 4 puffs and worked it into the crown and back of my wet hair.  After blowing it dry, it was so sticky that I broke ends trying to comb it through, and my In-Styler curling iron was almost useless, a tool that is normally fantastic for adding body, shine, and just a little curl.  Although I forced it into curling by over heat-styling it,  it didn't take much of a breeze to make pieces stick out.  I'll need to give my hair a good conditioning before I try again.  One reviewer didn't think it was tacky enough, so goes to show different strokes for different folks. I have never had a problem with any mousse before.  I won't give up yet.OK, after trying every possible way to make it work, I am done. One poof does nothing, 2 starts to create that sticky thing that keeps my hair from responding to heat styling. It seems to cause dryness and turns my normally sleek hair into fuzz that begs to be conditioned.  I don't get it, considering how many great reviews the product gets.  Maybe I got a bad bottle. Or maybe it doesn't work well with Wen hair cleanser, which I use.  I'll never know because I'll never try it again. In the trash it goes."
7927,1,"Truly Smell-Free_This sunscreen has the best feel and texture to it - the same as the expensive 'girly' lotions I've taken to using on my face (to avoid acne).  It really does go on feeling fine - especially after a shower or at least a good face-washing.  But the best thing is that it really doesn't smell like anything - no more disappointment when you smell the beach but you're really just going outside for yard work.  No more thinking of seagulls every morning.As always with these non-gross (oily) sunblocks, they're not completely waterproof, but if I can refrain from sweating profusely, it's no problem.  Good stuff."
2935,1,"Best consumer tanning product on the market_I am very fair-skinned so it's been especially tough trying to find sunless tanners that don't streak -- and no lie, I've tried just about every sunless tanner product on the market -- from the drugstore tubes to the super-pricey bottles from the Nordstrom cosmetic counter. SheerTan is far and away the best thing I've ever used. In fact, I got a professional airbrush tan a year ago and the results I got with SheerTan are just as nice -- only for the price of one airbrush tan, you can buy this product and get multiple spray tans out of it -- all you need to buy after the starter kit are refills.Lastly, (and this cannot be underestimated) their customer service is terrific (and no, I don't work there). I had a question and they got back to me immediately with a comprehensive answer.Love it and completely recommend it!"
6908,0,"I don't like the way it looks_You can't put just one coat on because it goes on unevenly.  You have to put many coats on.  And it just looks messy, the little stick-looking things clump up.  It was REALLY hard to take off also.  I just was not happy with the product."
2679,1,"Really, Really Works on Liver Spots_I finally decided to try and get rid of liver spots on the back of my hands which have become worse over time. My daughter mentioned it recently which prompted me to research which products had the most chance of working. Alpha Hydrox Spot Light Targeted Skin Lightener and Porcelana seemed to have good reviews so I bought both. It is now only day 4 and I'm suprised that I can see actual fading already. I have applied both twice daily which I read a doctor recommended for maximum results. The smell doesn't bother me and I have only noticed a very slight tingle from the Alpha Hydrox Spot Light once or twice. I have also noticed a slight pinkish tint to the skin a couple times (which doesn't last) but no irritation. I'm sure everyone reacts in their own unique way, but considering I expected little to begin with, I'm satisfied with these preliminary results. If I can sigificantly reduce the discoloration I will be happy. So far, I am pleased."
1766,1,Very durable_very soft and you get your moneys worth for it. great scent and it is also awesome for my blonde hair.
8068,1,"Exceptional quality, love this the most out of 1o items I purchased_Out of my $250 purchases from Shany on Amazon, this is probably the best one. The lip gloss has amazing quality, well worth it for $18. 6 colors, my favorite colors, I have no complain on this item. Now I kinda like chewing my lips, the taste is very different, its something new, its not sweet or fruity that you get tired of it. The smell is good, and it does last a full day, for the first day, I re did my lips maybe twice, but I think im just used to that, otherwise I could see the colors on my lips and didn't need re applying. Case is nice, it same as the lipstick set, the different was I didn't like the color of lipsticks, but I like the colors on lip glosses.  I don't know how long they will last me, but I will update my post and let you guys know."

484,0,"Makes my nails peel!!_I wanted something to fill in my nail ridges without exposing me to harsh chemicals. This does that. Unfortunately, it seems to have caused my nails to peel! Fail!!"
4987,1,"Love It_I love this shampoo. I DEFINITELY notice a difference in the softness & (seeming) health of my hair since I began use. However, unlike some of the reviewers, I have not noticed a drastic change in the length of time needed between washes. In fact, because I work long hours and don't always have the ten minutes to spend on my hair in the shower, I like to alternate b/t Wen and my Serge Normant. I will say, if you follow the directions exactly (use AS MANY PUMPS AS IT SAYS - yeah, I know that seems like a lot - and then LEAVE IT ON FOR AT LEAST 5 MINUTES) make sure you rinse A LOT b/c unlike your normal shampoo, this stuff is wonderful but must realllllyyy be rinsed out, otherwise your roots will be greasy/limp within a day. I bought this for Christmas presents for all my girlfriends because I think (if you have the shower time) this is a wonder-shampoo. Excuse me - conditioning cleanser :)Would totally recommend, and don't waste your time, buy the big bottle. It will last you forever, and the small 6oz will only last you a couple weeks (if that)."
6986,0,BREAK OUT ALERT_This product shipped fast i recievd it quick along with awesome freebie samples..BUT it has a terrible effect on my skin! i broke out like crazy :&#60; if you have oily sensitive skin i do not recommend this product
6642,1,"wowzas_I think the Urban Gal Collection Brush Kit is awesome. I love that it's vegan, travel sized, & it comes with the carry on case, making it soo much easier to keep them all in one place, and stay organized!"
5530,0,"It didn't wow me_I know people rave about this stuff so I realize it will work for some and not for others. I must be in the category of other. It didn't hurt my skin. It helped to give it moisture but beyond that, I didn't notice a difference.If you try this and don't like it, don't let that discourage you though from trying out different Kiehl's products. I love some of their other products (rare earth, microblur, cr&egrave;me de corps are all tops in my book)."
1842,1,"I like it_This product shipped very quickly. I like the powder, good product, lasts a while. I definitely would order this again."
2683,1,"Non-irritating but somehow blurs up my contacts_I have used Aveenos Positively Radiant moisturizer for quite a while, but after having a period of my skin being a bit senstive I gave this a whirl. I will say it feels great on my skin. It absorbs nicely without feeling greasy. My skin feels soft and this product does not irritate my skin at all. However, I also have noticed daily problems with my contacts getting smudged up for seemingly no reason. NOTHING else has changed. I wash my hands well after applying moisturizer, have gone through several different pairs of contacts. And yes, I thoroughly clean my contacts nightly. And, of course I don't put the lotion near my eyes. But I swear it migrates into my eyes anyway and leads to constant smudging all day long. I mentioned my smudgy contacts to my hubby without mentioning the lotion, just complaining about the 'cloudiness' on my contacts. He asked if I was using the Aveeno face lotion and mentioned that whenever he uses it, it causes his eyes to water all day long. So... I really have done multiple things to rule out all other variables and all I can say is that there must be some residue that may easily get into your eyes, just a heads up for the contact wearers in particular."
7713,1,"Smells great (I don't see how anyone wouldn't like this product...?)_After researching and reading reviews on about 20 bb creams, I finally settled on this.  I love that it had a variety of colors.  I first wanted to buy no. 31 but after watching a youtube video where she revealed that the darker shade (no. 31) was more pinky and this one was more yellow, I decided on this one.  It is, indeed, very light when it goes on.  I look very pale and ghostly.  But I noticed that within a half hour to hour it settles quite nicely.  Also, once I added bronzer, highlighter and eye makeup, it looked very very nice and I realized that it's a good base.  The smell is wonderful - a bit like baby powder, which I love.  The coverage is not full but &#34;full enough&#34; for me.**MY TIP:  I first apply a layer of oil control moisturizer.  Then I put one pump of the Missha in my palm with one pump of an oil free moisturizer, I rub them together, and then I rub that all over my face just like lotion.  The Missha by itself goes on sort of thick and dry-like so when I mix it with the moisturizer it felt much more smooth and dewy, but then again dried nicely.I have yellow based, combination skin (which can, at times, get very very oily).  This is not an oil free bb cream, but I noticed it is just fine for me.  It doesn't feel oily at all.  I am mixed (blk, white, chinese, indian) and have tan skin (especially since I live in So Cal) but still I went with the no. 27.  I am, however, thinking of also purchasing the no. 31 and mixing them together."
1534,1,The only thing that works_I have combination skin that gets pretty oily in the warmer months.  I started using this product many years ago when it was available in drugstores and just recently found it again thru the companies website...cooperlabs.  Of course Amazon had the best prices.  This product is the only thing I have ever used that stops the oiliness and leaves a nice matte finish and doesn't leave a weird film on the skin.  It also comes in a blotter bottle but I like this bigger bottle to put on with a cotton ball in the morning.  I keep the blotter in my purse.  I do think you waste a lot on the cotton balls but it goes on nicely either way.  Does not have much of an odor in case that's a concern to some.  I recommend this or the blotter as opposed to the treated pads as they dry up fairly quickly if you are not using them quickly.
523,1,"Wow!!!_This foundation is perfect! I'm allergic to practically every foundation I've used.  So far, so good.  Not one issue.  I wanted to cover imperfections while remaining natural looking.  This is it!  My only suggestion is to purchase a little darker than you think.  I just add a little bronzer to add color.  I hope Philosophy never discontinues this product!!!"
6738,1,nail practice fingers_i havent used yet but i plan to practice my favorite designs on them!!!! and the price is grat for 5 fingers in sallys 1 finger is 3 dollars!!!
4993,1,The price is right._This is my favorite cologne and the price offered here is the best I have found anywhere. I will continue to buy it here as I need it.
3213,1,"Get it!!1_I was a little skeptical about buying this product because I didn't want to spend that much money on something if it didn't work. It came in very quickly, and everything was carefully wrapped and protected in a box. It works great, and I would definitely buy this product again."
7960,1,yes!_i love this product it makes applying makeup easy! its so pigmented! i love showing it off to other people i absolutely was bouncing up and down when the mail man came saying package for me! i wish i could find more palettes like this one!
624,1,"Luminous And Lasting_I sometimes hesitate to use the powder forms of Blush, as they almost ALL have that marked tendency to remain on the skin's surface, rather than sinking down into the skin for that &#34;lit from within&#34; look we all desire. But this glorious B. Brown Shimmer Blush avoids all those common mistakes, and instead strikes a home run in every department. Although powder, it strokes on in an utterly creamy manner. The &#34;shimmers&#34; are subtle & very well blended, leaving you w/ a dewy glow rather than a Disco Ball mask.The bronze shimmer is perfect for Fall. I received it in a kit and love the way it looks. I need to be careful, because one stroke is all I need on my fair skin, more than that is too too much. I like the way this bronze shimmer looks on my skin.It leaves a glow that is luminous and it lasts. One of my favorites.Recommended. prisrob 10-15-13"
3598,1,"FABULOUS for my skin!!!_I've been using another peel of lesser strength and today this came. I tried it and wow, my skin has transformed. My pores are so much smaller, not oily and the tone is evening out. I just love this stuff.  I hope it continues to work the same for my problem skin. I'm 50 with a history of acne from the age of 14. I have had embarrassing skin my whole life and its hereditary. My whole family has bad skin.  But this has changed things. My mom saw me and she immediately asked what I was doing to my skin. It's fabulous and I completely recommend it if you have problem skin.  Yes, it did burn and it was very strong.  Be careful if you have sensitive skin.  My skin is the type that nothing has ever worked, even the so called strongest of acne products. Even prescription acne meds have done nothing for me but this worked."
8360,1,"Wow!  So much fun - you should try it!_I almost didn't buy this because I have so many specialty top coats and finishes, but I am so glad I did!  This looks phenomenal over ANY saturated polish color --- my fave of the moment is a classic bright red.  Applies *very well* for being a chunky glitter with bars.  You get a nice randomness with the glitters.  The base is crystal clear so it doesn't change your base color.  Not too lumpy when dries, only requires a single top coat."
3838,1,So cheap and so good_The product is so cheap and at the same time so good. your eyebrow will look very natural.You should try it
5267,0,"definately not the results achieved as shown in pictures_While there are definately some results with this tape, I can't see wearing it all day long as it is very uncomfortable. I wore the neck band around the house for an hour or so and the taped popped off. God forbid I had worn it out and someone saw it! I think this is great for a quick photo for friends who haven't seen you in a while.  Also, it is hard to hide the tape around the ears, but again, for a quick, deceitful photo, it's great."
3240,1,"You can't go wrong with organic_I've tried different night creams and this by far is the best night cream in the market. Some people seem to not like the smell but i love it. When i wake up in the morning my skin looks 10X better than it used to look before. Im so impressed with this product im thinking about buying it as a gift for my sister. Try it, you will love it:)"

3176,0,"So orange..._I bought this in Soft Sable, one of the darkest colors. My skin is light beige but I purchased this to use for contouring, thus the darker color. It is VERY orange once I put it on (which is not a problem I've had before) and I can't imagine trying to use this all over my face as a foundation. It's extremely sheer."
1712,1,Brushed clean_Good price for my replacement brush heads. The normal is a little bit coarser than the sensitive but not harsh for me.
1699,1,Just the thing!_So soothing on dry sensitve skin! I love hot showers in the winter... I know it's bad for my skin. I know it dries my skin out and I know I shouldn't stand there like I do savoring the hot water. But I do - every time. This saves my skin and means that I get to enjoy a warm bath!!! Life is good.
6135,1,"Good Product_In general, it's a good product for its price. I read the reviews before I bought them, so I knew the downsides beforehand. It's not super shining, but it looks ok."
7857,1,"Handy to keep plates organized!_This is great to keep all of your stamping plates organized. I've only got enough plates to fill a few pages, but plan on growing my collection. Makes it easy to look at all of your designs and to keep from losing any of them."
7280,0,I was let down because it makes hair stiff and makes hair very greasy_Not very good from this product line. I was let down because it makes hair stiff and makes hair very greasy. I am Irish and my hair is very thin. Not for everyone.
496,1,Just what I needed and wanted!!_I needed to upgrade my 5 brushes to one &#34;great&#34; one and this is it!!! It helps to detangle and style which is just what I needed. What a great price too!!!
410,1,"Works overnight!_I wish I'd known about this long ago.  I used to get those cystic type blemishes that take forever and ever to go away.  If one starts, I dip the handle end of a makeup brush into this, dab it on, and my skin is normal in the morning.  Even my husband uses it, it's that effective.  It's pink and dry, like Caladryl lotion."
4259,1,"You NEED to buy this shower cap!_I have long, thick hair - and I don't wash it every day because it's hi-lighted and I don't want it to dry out.  I've used numerous shower caps and they're all the same - too small (I have a LOT of hair), too flimsy, the back of my head/neck gets wet, the hair around my ears gets wet, fabric lined caps get mildewy, dirty, and smelly, etc.NOT ANYMORE!On the advice of a friend I purchased this shower cap - I think it ran me around $8 at Sallys.  More than the ones you'll pick up at the grocery store, but well worth it!First of all - the cap is thick, large enough to cover my entire head - front and back - and my ears.  And to top it all off - it's cute!Definitely, definitely invest in this shower cap if you have long, thick hair like I do.  You won't regret it!UPDATE:  While I still think this is a fantastic shower cap, I will say that I have already been through 2 of them.  The elastic doesn't seem to last very long and considering the price, I feel it should last longer than it does.  I've considered buying a 3rd, but may end up trying out a new brand to see if it will last longer.  (I want to add that I do not stretch it out excessively, I do not have a particularly large head, etc., so I am not sure why I am having this problem - at first I thought it was just a fluke, but now that it's happened again, I'm not so sure....)"
513,1,Loved_White powder for the face can be scary but this stuff is amazing.  I loved the awake glow it gives me.
3182,1,"Great smoother, does not irritate skin_I have used this for several years.  I don't usually put it on before my foundation as it is hard to spread. I mix a little of it with my makeup cream in the palm of my hand then spread it on. It makes the makeup look so much better and I'm getting SPF.  At home I just apply my face cream first then put some of this on. A little blush and a little lipstick and I look so much better when just working around the house."
9275,1,Great Travel Set_I needed a travel brush set and this was perfect!!! The tube allows you to pack the brushes up with ease and the case also helps keep the brushes free of dust when they are not being used.
1661,0,"Not Impressed At All_Still trying to figure out how a product containing coconut milk, coconut oil and egg white proteins can leave hair dry.  You would think that with those ingredients it would leave your hair on the oily side.  Not so with this product.Color treated hair comes out dry and in desperate need of a leave in conditioner.  Even after using the matching conditioner, you will still need to seek out a leave in variety just so you can comb through and style.A product that I do not think I will be using again.Back to BioInfusion Hydrating Shampoo a great product for softness, shine and volume."

5966,1,"Wrap to Waves Ceramic Hair Styler_The Remington Wrap to Waves Ceramic Hair Styler produces a pretty result, shiny waves with as much curl on the ends as you want.  It takes some practice to get the technique down just so, though, some trial-and-error, if you're using the styler on our own hair.  It isn't as easy as just whirling a curling iron through your hair.  I think it would be super-easy if you were using this on someone else's hair, because in that case, you don't have to rely on a mirror to see where you're working, and because after a while, this styler can get a little heavy if you have a lot of hair and/or longer hair.I like that there are no clamp marks or 'fish hooks' left behind on the hair from using this styler.  It achieves a very pretty deep wave that looks natural and more life-like than the deep-wave crimping irons from back in the day.  With practice, you'll get faster, and will know how to wrap your hair around the rods to get the effect you're looking for, but it does take a little more practice than your average curling iron."
1475,1,"I have kept coming back to this serum year after year!_I first used John Frieda Frizz-Ease serum in high school, when I was still trying to straighten my thick, curly hair.  It was the only thing that made my hair soft.  For several years after high school, I went curly and tried to do the no-shampoo, no-cone thing a laCurly Girl: The Handbook, but my hair never looked that great.  Now I wear it curly all the time, never shampoo it, and use silicone-based products like this one without any problems.  This extra-strength version of the serum is the rock of my hair-care regimen.  I use six pumps of it every day (if that sounds like an outrageous amount, keep in mind that my hair is very thick and reaches my mid-back after curling up).  My hair never feels heavy or greasy unless I use way too much.  My hair is curlier, shinier, and more beautiful than ever since I started using this again, and I get compliments every day which is the best. :-)"
1143,1,"Amazing_Like all philosophy products, this one delivers. Smells sooo clean, fresh, and crisp, with the scent lingering on your skin for hours afterward. I can't stop smelling my skin! It's not overwhelming at all. My boyfriend smelled it and immediately buried his face in my skin to smell more ;)"
9696,1,"another winner from clear scalp_I love clear scalp and hair hydration nourishing shampoo. It has a pleasant clean scent, lathers nicely, rinses beautifully, and leaves my hair soft and shiny, even on those day I skip the conditioner. I haven't tried a clear scalp shampoo I don't like.  a lot of intense hydration types translate to greasy and heavy, but with the clear scalp I just feel my hair isn't as dry and fly away, not weighed down.I do have very dry hair. My hair is fine, but very dry."
8273,1,"Super pigmented!_This blush is soooooooo pigmented! I have it in Superstar and Headliner and both colors are gorgeous and work well with my very pale skin. It also lasts forever on your cheeks. However, given the superior pigmentation of this product it is very important to apply it correctly or you will end up looking like a clown. I always shake it before applying and then I squirt the smallest quantity possible - that will be plenty! I always do this on the back of my hand and I would never recommend applying the product directly from the container to the face. I then blend the product on the back of my hand with the ELF Small Stippling brush and then apply it to my cheeks. I start with very little product, blending it in very well, because you can always layer more if you want a more intense color. I love it!"
2321,1,Silky!!!_I am using my husbands account but let me say I live this primer! A little goes a long way and my face is so smoothe and silky. I use liquid foundation and it looks great when I apply it over this primer! I'll be buying again!!
9043,1,"Love this brush_This brush gets through tangly wet hair with ease and very little breakage, if any. I would highly recommend it."
5799,1,Amazing_I love to put this product on my hair right when I section my hair or do mini twists.  It absorbs very quickly and really provides a good balance of moisture.  This is one of my staple products.
2906,1,Nice_Pretty great sleep mask. I used it a few times before gifting it to my light sleeper roommate. It's nice. Can't really say it being frozen helps though.
9785,1,In home spa treatment_This is a great item that makes you feel like you are getting a spa treatment at home. It has helped to clear up my skin. It also has a nice soft feel to it now! Definitely worth getting!
4054,1,"Zeno Hot Spot_This works!  It's hard to believe that heat can shrink a pimple, but it does work.  I am pleased at the rate that the pimple shrinks after application of the Zeno."
9106,1,"Works wonders._This is a wonderful product from Olay.  They have been in my family for years, my mom used their stuff I did, left and went to high end brands like Philosophy and Clinique - Olay has me back.  Love it!"
7421,1,"great body and shine no conditioner needed_This is a very nice shampoo, it leaves your hair clean and feeling moist even when wet. It doesn't leave your hair that squeaky dry feeling when wet like after using a clarifying shampoo yet it cleans very well. I can get a comb through my hair easily after using it which is unusual for my long very fine hair that easily tangles. When my hair dried it was even a little wavy, very shiny and the fragrance is quite pleasant and lasted into the next day. My scalp has a tendency to break out from many shampoos but this one didn't do that at all. I tried the conditioner but found I didn't need it, it actually made my hair to heavy and was oily looking before the day was done. I use this shampoo alone and I really like the results."
577,1,Great shampoo_This is wonderful shampoo for colored hair.  It gives it a glow and shine that lasts through to next coloring.
455,1,"EXCELLENT MASCARA_I was lucky to get 2 tubes of this at an outlet store on sale for $15 (The ones that carry Lancome, Lauren, etc) and did not realize YSL was part of the L'Oreal corporate umbrella.  I had been using Chanel for years and pciked this up due to the price.  Love it.  Goes on  thinly enough that I could apply two coats.  My lashes were soft and naturel looking - and no flakes!  Wish I had bought more."
3245,0,"No Thanks_As other reviewers have noted, this product makes the hair take on a rather greasy look. I personally dislike that and it really doesn't make me want to use it."
9351,1,"Excellent customer service!_When I first received this mask, I was disappointed. The material wasn't smooth feeling, it irritated my skin when I wore it and little threads of stuffing were coming through the material. I contacted Fishers Finery customer service and they promptly sent me another mask. The replacement mask is wonderful. No more skin irritation and no more stuffing coming out in little threads (I think the original mask was overstuffed and therefore causing the problems.)The size of the mask is perfect because you can pull it down or up to get the best coverage for your face. The elastic straps are comfortable, but I do have a small sized head for an adult so it doesn't really stretch out on my head. Their excellent customer service is enough to earn my loyalty as a customer because it's so rare to find such great and prompt customer service these days."
5276,1,Love this Mousse_Like all Adigir products this styling mousse is wonderful.  It gives my hair shine and volume.  I just partially dry my hair and then add a small amount of the mousse and finish drying it and then style with curling and flat iron.  Has a wonderful fragrance too!!
4030,1,"Excellent product_This is the best $16.55 I have ever spent.This is an awesome product to deep repair masque is a hair reconstructor that will penetrate and rebuild damaged hair for improved shine and elasticity. after shampooing and conditioning my hair, I apply a small amount of macadamia oil deep repair mask to my hair and let it air dry.smells so fresh. really happy with this purchase.I will definitely purchase again in the future ."
6168,1,"Better than those expensive sprays!!!_This is the best spray out there to set make-up. I will not be purchasing anymore $25-$35 make-up setting sprays because this works just like it!  All I did was poured it into one of those $32 bottles and sprayed - it worked like a charm!!! Try this product because it can't hurt, it's only a couple a dollars, not $32!"
1497,1,"Worth the money_I've had this product for several months now and for me, it works great. It is definitely worth the money (rather than paying more than double like some products). This curling iron heats up quickly, as well as cools down quickly. The cord is long and flexible which makes for easy maneuvering. I purchased the 3/4' curling iron through my discover card rewards on their website, and read the reviews on Amazon. I notice that several people noted that the purple coating comes off. For mine, it is still on there. There could be many factors why or why not the coating comes off. I don't use any hair products, so that could be one possibility."
1509,1,"Great Product_This chemical peel really is the real deal. I used it to spot treat some pimples and within a couple of days, they were all dried up and gone!"
8689,1,"Good Make Up Wipe_These were pretty good make up remover pads, and they were gentle enough for use around the eyes.* Pretty moist straight out of the package but not overly wet.* Not scented.* Gentle enough to be used around eyes without hurting.* Had some difficulty removing all makeup.They were good for use in removing an average application of makeup, including makeup around the eyes."
2916,1,"Classic, basic bar soap_This is a no frills bar of soap. It's reasonably priced and does what you need soap to do. It doesn't have any added oils, butter, fragrances etc so if you want something fancy this is not it. It's fairly neutral as far as bar soaps go."
7480,0,"Not Recommended For Fine Hair_I have really fine hair and I don't think this conditioner was a good choice for me. It was as easy to use as most instant conditioners. My hair felt over conditioned and their was some build up after just using it once. It was impossible to style after using this. My hair was flat, flat, flat and sort of oily looking. In all fairness, this might be a great product for dry and damaged hair that is frizzy or heavy but that isn't my issue."
1652,1,"Good bye dead dry hair_I have said so long to my dry dead hair and hello to soft and healthy hair. This product works great on my hair I mix it with the Kanechom Goat's Milk and it really works. My hair needs all the help it can get, and with this product I don't have to pay high salon prices anymore. I am saving money and looking great who could ask for more"
1643,1,"Alter Ego Energizing Intensive Hair Lotion for Hair loss_I went to a new Dominican hair stylist with my own supplies! My new stylist name is Lora ( a stylist in marieta): (This store is 2 minutes away in the car! Its $20 for a wash and set on Wednesday and Thursdays! )Kera Care 1st lather shampoo, Kera Care moisturizing shampoo and deep moisturizing conditioner.  Not forgetting my Alter EGO Energizing Intensive Hair Lotion for Hair Loss.  I want to share with you that my hair is no longer shedding/ breaking at all!  I am just going to go the the hair dresser every two weeks. My hair works better going the the hair dresser than trying to do it myself. When I did it myself my hair was still shedding:(  I am usually scared to run my fingers through my hair,but I did and this time there were no shedding hairs or breakage! Its nice not to hear my kids who are 8, 9 and 12, telling me that my hair is breaking and falling on my robe!  No more hairs in the comb! No more hairs in the sink! I feel alot lighter. It's nice to hear that it is working for me. Things like this is always working for others, but now for me!*Make sure to use a deep conditioner;when i didn't use this on my hair hair it made my hair feel dry.I use Lacio, lacio is a leave-in conditioner and Cristalli Liquidi for maintance.ps: I just received the Alter Ego Shampoo for hair loss yesterday. I will take this with me the the hair dressers next time."
6893,1,"Addicted to the Scent_I have some of the fussiest, most sensitive skin out there. Despite it being sensitive, I have the T-zone issue that many women have. So while my chin, nose and forehead tend to get oily, my cheeks usually have dry skin. Add in rosacea that runs in the maternal side of our family, and my skin can be a mess.The first time I used the Cetaphil Dermacontrol, I smelled the fragrance and feared my skin was about to have a field day reacting to the obvious perfume. Thankfully it hasn't because I really do love the scent. It's kind of a floral, powdery mix that I find incredibly soothing.I've been using it for a week, and any breakouts have disappeared. The foam wash rinses cleanly, hasn't been drying out my skin, and has been amazing. My skin's looking much better than it has for months. Cetaphil jumps to the top of my must-keep-in-stock list.This is a foam product. I find that two pumps of the bottle provides the suitable amount for washing my face and neck.There is a matching moisturizing lotion that you can purchase, but I find my skin really likes Aveeno's Ultra Calming moisturizer best."
3911,1,"NYX Auto Eyebrow Pencil Charcoal Great for Brunettes_I like the coverage I get from this eyebrow pencil.  I got the pencil because the outer edges of my brow can be a little sparse.  I'm glad I got this color and didn't go with the Black as it is the perfect shade for my only slightly darker eyebrows.  To get a sense of how it works for me, I have dark, dark brown hair with mahogany glints and even darker, almost black eyebrows.  The pencil glides on smoothly, and can be built up in layers depending on how light a touch you use.  The brush at the end is also great for blending and grooming your eyebrows."
5347,1,"Like it_Gave me a nice soft focus glow! Elf products are so good and inexpensive, will be buying more of this"
8858,1,"great color_I love OPI polish.  I have never been disappointed with the quality.  I would prefer to actually see the product but when you have limited colors in town, this is a great second choice."
4989,1,"compact and serviceable_cute and tiny, it also folds up.  great secondary or travel blowdryer, it does catch my hair in the back into the air intake if i hold it too close."
5524,1,I've been using this for months._I've been using this scrub since May and I've fallen in love. I'm a big fan of neutrogena so I was always using their products and my skin started to get immune so I needed to make a swtich. I have combination/oily skin and this has worked wonders for me! My skin is no longer as oily and greasy as before. The scrub is really effective and I feel like I'm getting a really deep clean when I use it. It dries up my pimples and washes away my blackheads. I adore this scrub and I would recommend it!
9604,1,"Nourishes Dry and/or Damage Hair_This product is great for dry, damaged hair. I have to wash my hair every day. I noticed the difference the first time I used it. After seven days my hair was beautiful if I do say so myself. I used it with the shampoo. I highly recommend this product."
6619,1,Awesome_Amazing for hair I love it makes my hair look and feel amazing and helps manage my hair and keep it tame
5463,1,"Smooth and Easy_Going back to old school rolling (African American), does not tug at hair or scalp. Easy to sleep! Fast delivery!"
955,1,"Nice rich moisture that lasts_Mild smell, very pleasant, easy to massage onto skin and provides moisture that seems to last longer than lotions. I've used other Body Butters from this same brand, my favorite is the Vitamin E butter, but the Aloe is good too."
6386,1,"Great For Intense Color_I just recently (last 3 months) began purchasing & using Sigma brushes and I have yet to not love one of them! I have a very small eyelid and they are hooded, this brush allows me to really concentrate color on the lid and create a 'crease' that I don't normally have. It's also great for smudging color on the upper & lower lash lines. The bristles are packed tightly and the brush handle (as with all Sigma brushes) is easy to hold and easily apply your makeup. I love my Sigma brushes, this is my honest opinion, not for a gift, etc. I highly recommend them if you have never used decent makeup brushes and they're very affordable!! Thanks Sigma & Amazon :)"
9851,1,"Interesting idea_Remington Products S7231 Wet to Straight Straightener, 2 InchWell this is a practical idea that saves time. It depends on your hair type as to whether it will work for you or not. I have thick curly hair so I let it air dry for a bit while doing my makeup and then it worked better. I do not think it works well on hair dripping wet straight out of the shower. Maybe it would for someone with a different hair type. My hair is naturally curly and on the wild side. This worked nicely when I sectioned my hair after letting it air dry a few minutes and then put the wet to straightener to work. It took longer in some ways than I expected but it was nice to get the job done without switching hair tools."
7586,1,Good product_These brushes are easy to use and quality distributes acrylic liquid n powder on nails it was so goo i had to but another it is a must have.
3616,1,"Wonderful for deciding on full-size purchases_I bought this to try different kinds of Skin79 BB Creams before committing to a full-size. I highly recommend this to make sure you find a shade that works for you before you accidentally buy a product that doesn't work for you. For reference, I am a W2 in L'Oreal's True Match line.To give you an idea:Hot Pink - more matte finish, slight grey cast. I like the finish because even though my skin is dry, I don't like a dewy look. Seems to be a decent shade match.VIP Gold - slightly dark on me, very heavy formula that is good for very dry skin.Light Pink - I didn't care for this one. It was less opaque than Hot Pink and a bit too pale.Diamond - Could be used for highlighter, but the sparkles make it unusable for your whole face unless you're a Cullen."
3258,1,"staple_this is a must have, i use it as a base and my shadows don't crease and my colors pop!!! Who knew that white shadow would make a chocolate girl like myself fall in love with the many colors of the rainbow. I'm very pleased with this product and decided to buy more so that I can depot it and put it in a pan. I use it daily."
3592,1,woooow_if you want the color of your hair this will sure do it it gives you the best last longing results i love it and am glad i got these
882,1,Great for oily skin!_This product is fantastic! It didn't make me break out. I used far less oil sheets during the day and really noticed a difference! It lasts awhile and is reasonably priced. Excellent!
3604,1,"zuzu mascara_I really like this mascara as far as being natural. Mascara goes into your blood stream. Most people do not know this, so using something natural is important. I like how it looks natural also. I had to however give it a four star because on some occassions, not all, I have noticed flaking. It kind of is an on again off again issue. Probably not for the person who wears contacts."
5642,1,"Not Bad_I have yet to find the mascara that is the &#34;one&#34;. While this mascara is nice, I don't find it any different or better than the other mascaras available in your drug store. It has a nice black color, it is thick (if you like that), and it washes off easily even though it is a waterproof mascara. I didn't think it would actually make my eye lashes grow, but I figured the extra conditioning aspect of this mascara couldn't hurt. Overall I didn't see much of a change in my lashes. Would I purchase this mascara again in the future? Probably so, who knows... it just may make my eye lashes grow longer with continued use."
1670,1,"Best leave in conditioner and smells good too_Compared to drugstore leave-in conditioners such as pantene, this one really does a great job. I love the smell and the immediate results after 4-5 sprays. It's lightweight and doesn't leave my hair sticky or feeling yucky at the end of the day. Hair looks smoother and healthier. Will never use another brand again. After using this one, I also purchased the conditioner which works well too."
4966,1,"Inexpensive quality product_The 6-ounce pack couldn't be more convenient. To my relief, the bottles arrived without leaking. The scents are nice. The consistency is nice and thick and easy to hold in your hand. And you can't beat Subscribe and Save for the convenience."
9245,1,"Manly sunscreen? Why, yes!_My husband is an avid golfer and is pretty particular about the suncreen he uses when he is going to be out in the sun for many hours. It can't be drippy when sweating, shiny on his face or slick to the touch. Actually, all the things that most of us look for, I suppose.In any case, he gave the Triple Defense Spray a five star rating right away. He says it performs perfectly, keeping him sun safe with no hassle, and the added bonus of a fresh scent was actually appreciated. Instead of smelling like sweat and chemicals (like some sunscreens do to you by the end of the day) this stayed fresh smelling but not at all overpowering. I happen to like the fresh scent as well. It's mild and clean.Definitely a new top buy in this house."
8623,1,"Great for extending a blowout by wrapping_I have long (really long) fine hair. It is naturally a frizz ball but I have it straightened professionally with a keratin product. Although I am Caucasian wrap my hair at night. I learned how on YouTube. It is a genius thing to do. You wake up with silky straight hair, there are no tangles and you avoid tons of damage.Of course my tips dry out. So the Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Leave-In Conditioning Foam is fantastic for rubbing through the ends of my hair before combing it into the wrap. It brushes out smoothly and is not sticky or filmy. I also seems not to promote tangles as some leave ins do."
1703,1,"Good product for the price._I had read a lot of positive reviews of L'Oreal True Match beauty products in fashion magazines, so I decided to give it a try.  I was a big fan of Prescriptives until they closed all of their department store counters, and I had to order online.  I was running low, so I took the compact and what little powder was left to my local Walmart and matched the color to L'Oreal Paris True Match powder in Nude Beige.True Match powder is not nearly as fine as more expensive brands, but it does the job.  I'm not sure it would go on effectively if I used the sponge that came with the compact, but it goes on quite well with a good powder brush.  I can also tell that I have to use more to get the same coverage as my last brand, so it will probably run out faster for the same quantity.  But it is about a third of the price, so the only thing that bugs me that it runs out quickly is I'll be contributing three times as many empty powder compacts to the landfill.  I'll have to find out if they're recyclable."
8310,1,"like it_I have extra long hair and have had it this way since I was a child so I know how important it is to take care of long hair, especially as one gets older.  As a user of Moroccan Oil in other brands, it was interesting to compare to the Suave version.  I left it in for fifteen minutes and this mask left my hair looking thick and healthy, though not with the 'extreme' shine I get from other brands with Moroccan Oil in them.  I like it, but would have liked to see more shine.  I am intrigued enough to try the other products in this line, in any case."
1952,1,"It's Good but I prefer my Queen Helen Mint Julep Mask_It tightens pores, but with Queen Helen's Mint Julep Mask, I don't have to mix it up! Plus, you get the minty scent.This product is too messy."
4575,1,"Miracle Makeup Remover.._As someone with dry, very sensitive skin I tried this product about a year ago and fell in LOVE. Its magic water, never irritates, breaks me out or burns my hypersensitive skin. It works when I take off heavy eye makeup or when Im too lazy to wash my face. You cannot go wrong with this product if your looking for a great makeup remover."
3450,0,"It may work for some - but not for me_I keep on trying this and it does absolutely nothing.  Really. Not a thing.  I started doing one eye only to prove it.  Very disappointed as I've rarely found an Olay product that did not live up to at least most of its claims.  No reduction in puffy eyes, or bags, no improved skin around the eyes -- just a waste of money for me. If I could return this, I would."
4184,1,Sample goes along way_I received a sample of this from a local Avon representative. I used it and fell in love with it. I have very sensitive skin and can't use allot of products that are on e market. It doesn't matter if ey are low in price or expensive. This cream is light weight. Not heavy like allot of moisturizers out there. I had no break outs and the cream is not greasy at all. If you have acne prone sensitive skin this is the product for you. I also use the night cream that is paired with this. It also works great.
8147,1,Great Skin Care Kit_Great skin care kit. I like the accessories included for the face and body. Cool. I would definitely purchase this again and recommend it highly.
7831,1,"Grandma and Granddaughter approved_We recently moved into a home with a large, but angular tub. I love the tub, but while it was large enough for soaking, the nearly straight back made it not as much fun to lounge. At the same time, I have been disappointed over the years with air pillows, which seem to quickly spring leaks.So when I was offered the opportunity to receive a complimentary test model, I thought, 'why not?'It arrived yesterday, and I set it into the tub to test later. So I found it interesting that when I checked on my six year old granddaughter, she had it set up at her heighth and was lounging away. She declared it 'very comfortable.' later, when I had my bath, I adjusted it higher, and enjoyed a nice lounge, till the water cooled off.It is easy to adjust, easy to clean, and approved by both grandma and granddaughter.Edited -It is now more than a year later. Last week my granddaughter was being rough in the tub and managed to tear out one of the suction cups. What made me take notice was that even though the suction cup came out, the material did NOT tear and I was able to get it back in.To me, this is the sign of a well-made product that has already outlasted all of the blow up ones I have ever bought, still going strong."
1793,1,"My husband smells yummy_Very nice, clean, sexy scent. This scent is very light and not overpowering at all, my husband loves it and so I. Good buy"
8984,0,One Star_Waist the money!
9238,0,"If you love the smell of maple.._I should know by now that if it's a spice + something in Wen's conditioners for scent, the spice will kill the something! This smells like pure maple syrup. I don't smell any apple at all. I don't know why they are so heavy handed with the spice and nothing on the fruit,in this case apple- last time pumpkin. Such a shame. Should have apple first then a hint of maple- now that would be a hit!"
1276,1,"Great!_I have wavy hair.  It really likes to tangle.  I ordered this brush on a whim and when I got it, I was like oh no, this could not possibly work.  It appears flimsy compared to what I'm, used to, but it does actually get the job done easily.  I'm not altogether sure what about the design works, but it's the best detangling brush I have ever used.  I'm planning to order a couple more just for back-up."
2973,1,"Yowza!!! This thing really works!_Before buying this product, I read all the reviews here and guessed that it worked for some people but not for others, but I decided to get it anyway. And it worked for me, and in only a few days too!I have age spots on my cheekbones, more on the left than on the right, most likely due to me driving and getting more Sun on the left. My wife and a bunch of her friends all got their age spots removed at a salon and they all came back with scabs which fell off after a few days but that cost hundreds of bucks. Mine have steadily gotten worse over time and I decided to do something about it after reading some on-line article about Olay's Pro-X line. All work by removing the top layers of skin and allowing new skin to grow back. The salon uses lasers, doctors use dermabrasion and this cream works by disrupting the collagen fibers or something like that.I used it like the instruction said, once in the morning and once at night. If you go out in the day, you have to make sure you use a high SPF suntan lotion to protect the area. I have big and small spots, light and dark spots. In just a few days I could see the darkness decrease and I knew it was working because I could hardly tell where the lighter spots were anymore. I've only had this a few days, but so far I highly recommend this."
3627,1,"REUNITED and my hair feels so good_Silly title aside, this is my favorite. I had used it in the past and bought the huge liter bottles, but it lasted me so long that the products probably past their shelf life. I mixed it up trying different products, but returned to this. So glad I did. I have very thick hair that tends to get too big and frizzy. This is absolutely the best for it. My hair is soft smoother and more manageable. I am now a loyal dermorganic user."
5673,1,Nice product._Nice product to use with Gelish nails--but you can use alcohol in its place.  This is slightly less drying than using alcohol alone.
803,1,"Love love love this moisturizer!!_I've been having a problem with moisturizers lately. Either they break me out or they don't moisturize enough. This moisturizer has changed everything! My skin is break out free, moisturized perfectly, smooth, soft, and radiant. It absorbs really nicely into the skin without making my skin feel greasy. You don't need a lot of product, you can always add more product if you need, but start out applying sparingly. It's really creamy but not thick and it's easy to work into your skin. This moisturizer isn't heavily scented, it's rather light and fresh and dissipates quickly. It's really soothing and calming...when I apply it I can almost hear my skin say &#34;Ahhhh&#34; in relief, lol.I use it nightly after cleansing my face with my Caudalie foaming cleanser. I rarely use it twice a day anymore since my skin has been less dry since I've been using this.It's formulated to keep your skins ph balanced. Until I started using this I didn't really know what that meant or how it affected my skin. Using a bunch of products really throws your ph off, causing more problems than not. I find when I keep my skin care simple, my skin looks and feels better.Thus moisturizer is also paraben free, which is a plus. I wish they would package it differently...jars are kinda cumbersome when traveling. Although the jar does make it easier to use all the product so you're not left with a tube that has product in the bottom that you can't get out.I highly recommend giving this moisturizer a shot if you're experiencing dryness and break out easily."
9914,1,"This Glycolic is fantastic for my skin!_This is a nice large bottle of Glycolic face wash. I love the pump dispenser, I keep it in my shower with my Clarisonic brush. The brush pushes the Glycolic deeper into the skin. I had a few black heads I was fighting and they are gone. My skin is clearer and brighter."
5005,1,Love the color_Manic panic is my people love them this lipstick is wicked I love it so much I will be seeing u soon thanks a bunch
3327,1,"Usage during March-April_I tried using the product as instructed just once during the day but it left my skin vulnerable to dryness.  So I started to use it both in the morning and at night and I loved the results.  It left my skin moist with a dewy appearance. This product is paraben-free, and propylene glycol-free.Made in Germany"
6248,1,"Excellent_I think that this is an excellent shampoo. What I particularly like about this shampoo, is the fact that it gets in between all of my hairs and all the way down to my scalp. I had never felt my head and hair as clean, as I do after I'm done washing my hair with this shampoo."
7191,1,Nice Smell_I have an obsession with soap. This doesnt over dry my face. i dont think it doesnt anything special but I like it
4890,1,"Love this product_I ordered the smaller version prior to this one, I use it every night as moisturizer over my face , neck and chest area, use sparingly a little goes a long way, just massage in really good and nothing will rub off the pillow etc.I also think my skin really improved with it, I have much less breakouts or adult acne, as soon as you feel a little bump, dap a generouse amount just on that spot, repeat as much as you can after you washed your face thoroughly, I use lemongrass soap which I also purchased here on amazon. It all feels much gentler on your skin then the neutrogena products, which work well, but if you have sensitive, dry skin, that is sensitive against anything retinol, you definitely would want to try this.Don't get me wrong the Neutrogena brand is very good, but Ican only use it a couple times a week , otherwise it dries my skin out way to much , and twice a week does not seem to keep my break outs under control.Only con for the 120 ml version here was for me , that I did not like the pump as much as I thought it did it does dispense way to much oil with one pump, so I actually kept my small tiny bottle and just refill with the larger bottles content.I can not say yet that my wrinkles , which I would describe of medium appearance for being mid 40th, mainly around forehead, side of nose going to mouth and above lip, but overall my skin feels wonderful.Will definitely stick with it for a complete year, and review accordingly.I did recommend this product to some of my friends."
1980,1,"love this stuff for my nail art stamping_Would order this again, love this stuff for my nail art stamping."
2956,1,"very nice_I got this and Im surprise it looks very profesional, and the set of brushes its well made.nice quality and cheap."
9386,1,"Great stuff_I didn't even realize that I should be using a serum as I am used to having pretty much flawless complexion with little to no work. But around the time of my 40th birthday that started to change and my facial skin started looking icky. Well this serum has seemed to played a part in reviving it, this in conjunction with glycolic peels."
51,1,"LOVE THIS!_I never taken care of my face as I should so I ordered a jar of this to start the process. Turning 30 is boring and hard. so far this has been a really, really great choice!! I have very sensitive skin and I get little to no breakouts and this lotion has been a perfect balance to keep that consistent. I've tried other lotions that claimed to be amazing (I'm looking at you Lush) and have either broken out of the ingredients have dried my skin out drastically.I will buy this again and continue to use it."
4132,1,"Product as I expected_I have asian straight-fine hair and it's hard to be curled. If I use a curling iron, my hair will be straight again in 1 hour. I search a lot and review every comment of all wave irons that Amazon has, and I finally decided for this one. This is my first wave iron. I tried on my hair once I got it and it is amazing. I did not use any product before I use it. I used it on my dry hair, and it creates soft-defined wave. EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED! and the good thing is, I can finish all in 20 mins (I have shoulder length hair) and it lasts all day. Cons: I need to use high heat to make it works. Low and medium heat are not enough to curl my hair. Also, I need to wait like 3-4 mins to let the iron to heat up to the optimum heat. Oh, another thing, it is easy to burn the skin since there is no plastic at the tip like flat or curl iron, so be careful! But overall, it is a great product for me. Reminder: if you have more coarse hair, it might not work becuase even I have fine hair, I need to use the max heat."
9460,0,"cheap looking and made the same way_terrible,,,,The stones are all a mess - - three are missing,- I still tried to use it, as they were missing from the ends, but no matter what I tried,  it wont sit flat on my head, it always rolls backwards, and falls off. It isn't worth the little bit that they charged. Skip this one if you can,,,"
4458,1,"I refuse to use any other eyeliner._Honestly, this is the best. I will never switch to anything else. =)It really does accentuate my eyes! Thank you!"
6075,1,Shine_My daughter dumped out this brand new bottle so I went to the store and bought another. Works great. Love the sleek and shine. Does exactly that.
3029,1,good for separating lashes_This mascara is one of the best I've used.  The wand has proven useful in separating my lashes.  Waterproof works well.
48,1,"Excellent eye make up remover!_This is a wonderful eye make up remover. I use a small dap, sub and them wipe off with a cotton round. It takes off heavy eyeliner and mascara. Its slightly greasy so i always was my face afterwards with soap to take the oily residue off."
4369,0,Not natural._Smells bad. Doesn't foam. NOT natural. Read the ingridiants and do your homework. Far better real natural/organic products for baby to choose from for the same price or less.
557,1,"My man seems happy_I bought these to go with a custom made safety razor I had made for my boyfriend. They seem to work for him, though I don't think he uses the safety razor every day (he has a matching mach three style for that)."
4889,1,"Love the product, hate the odor._This oil has so many benefits, but most people use it on the hair. Using the powder form is how you benefit the most from it. Please google &#34;benefits of Bringraj&#34; to see all that it can be helpful with pertaining to the human body. I use this oil as a hot oil treatment for my hair, and it has been awesome in keeping it moist. My hair was extremely dry from coloring & bleaching, but this has restored all that was lost. The odor is strong so beware, but it is worth it if you are looking for maximum results. The fact that my hair started growing faster was a bonus."
8236,1,Okay_The bottles look good. You can see right through them so you know what's inside of them. nice size it is okay for things like alcohol or acetone.
7786,1,"love this product line!_I am 43 and  live in the northeast.  I have never have had the cold winter create driness but this year was different.  I found great reviews regarding this &#34;intense hydration&#34; line and decided to order the cleanser!!  I fell in love with that and ordered the day cream to go along with it!  Like so many other women I have tried a ton of different products over the years, ranging from expensive dept store lines to the drug store brands!  And this is my favorite!  I have been using it for over a month and I love how soft my skin is and so many of the dry lines around my eyes have improved.  I just wished they made a toner to go along with this line.  So for now I will continue to use a  Keihls toner...  I am also so sensitive to fragrances and this is very faint but still very clean smelling and pleasant."
8193,1,Awesome_This is a fabulous palette for your brows.  It lasts all day and night!  This has become one of my staple cosmetics and a must have!
251,1,Great Cleanser_This is my second order for this product on Amazon. It is a high quality item that displays the best results when used in conjunction with small microfiber facial pads.
6332,1,"nice manicure set_I like that each section is numbered so you know what you're supposed to do next. Only problem I have is, when filing nails, because these are thick, you can't get to the edges of nails as good as a thin nail file. But other than that, I really like it."
6057,1,"Makes my hair shiny and expensive looking_I've used so many different hair oils from raw aragon oil to coconut oil, as well as Silk and hair serums.  Above all of those I've tried, this oil works wonders for my hair.  It is almost like a dry oil and it makes my hair supple and shiny without weighing it down or making it look greasy.  My hair never looks as good as when I've put this on.  It doesn't have a fragrance and it seems light on my hair.  It is the perfect hair oil for me."
8512,1,"Great for Women too!_Yes, I know this is for men, but I thought maybe it could give my poor pitiful, thin, baby fine hair some boost....and it did!  I was a little concerned that the scent would be too masculine, and it was a little masculine, but not overpowering so.  It has a fresh scent for either men or women.  I love it!  My hair does feel thicker and fuller.  I may share it with my husband, but I will definitely be shampooing with it myself.  I've never heard of caffeine in shampoo so maybe that's where the fullness comes from.  Anyway...I love this shampoo and will purchase it in the future."
2156,0,Toxic. Buyer Beware._Expeller pressed castor oil contains ricin. Beware. Use only cold-pressed castor oil.  I wasted money on this purchase. Buyer beware.
1706,1,GREAT PRODUCT._Came as described. For those having problems with the dispenser -- but it in boiling hot water for a few minutes. It will ease up the product in the bottle and you will never have to do this again. (Personal experience) Hope it works. This stuff is amazing but must be used in moderation because using it too often will do the exact opposite of its job and make you break out.
8026,1,Soft Hair_Ths is a little too light for my very fine curly wavy hair. It would probably work better on fine dry hair. My hair dresser loves it.
1977,1,Love it_I Definitely recommend this polish compared to regular polishes. It stamps on and stays on very well. I would buy this again. Only thing I wish the bottle contents was more.
2657,1,"Love this tool!_I recently cut my hair very short. It grows really fast and I didn't realize how tough the maintenance would be (or really how pricey it would be). So I bought this after watching a youtube video of a girl showing how to use it on her pixie cut. I absolutely love this tool and use it once a week! I have used it to add layers, to trim my hair and to thin it out - I have very thick hair. It allows me to only need a professional haircut every 3 months, if that. I did learn the hard way to be careful which side you use depending on your desired outcome... but that was my own fault :) I can't believe the price for this tool, as it's really fantastic. I have already recommended it to anyone else who has a short cut or needs to thin out their hair regularly."
1421,1,"Very sour, use less than on the label_I heeded another feedback and glad I did. Used 1/2 teaspoon and it cleaned my clock the next morning. Very sour tasting-like a super sour candy."
4297,1,"Does What Other Hair Products Don't_Five stars is supposed to mean &#34;I love it,&#34; and I can't say I'm quite that excited about this product.  It does, however, make a positive difference.  So it shouldn't be given a mediocre rating.  When I first got the product, I thought: &#34;Oh this is just another version of dry shampoo.&#34;  If you've ever used dry shampoo, you know that it fluffs up the hair by employing a powder to absorb excess oil.  This product, however, is more than that.  It goes on like powder, but then it becomes a stiffening agent.  So it really does &#34;volumize&#34; and &#34;texturize.&#34;  The advantage it has over liquid or foam products is that it can be applied precisely where you want it -- on the roots of the hair.  And of course, it's dry.  Thus, I find it different from any other hair product I've used.One caveat:  the quantity of powder is quite small.  The photo makes you think you're getting a container about the size of a medium can of hair spray.  In reality, it's more the size of a stick of deoderant.  That said, I use very small amounts of the powder.  So I'm sure the container will last me a good long while."
3483,0,"Didn't go on well_While I do like Elf products, this is one I sure didn't care for. The darker color didn't apply very well and seemed to have a waxy texture to it. I am gonna try ti again to see if it was maybe just me, but right now I know I would never buy this again."
6113,1,Loved it_I really loved this product and came very well packaged. None of the Rhinestones were out of the container and this item arrived way sooner than I expected it to get here. The only thing that I would like to mention is that the size of this circle looks bigger on Amazon than it really is. Its about the size of your hand but without the fingers....but other than that like I said very excellent product an dthe Rhinestones are just perfect for the nails so I would definitely recommend this product and seller to everyone!! Very satisfied customer!!
1646,1,"YES_Love these drops! I'm they type of person that paints my nails every week and needs them to dry FAST. I have no patience when it comes to wet nails. Just drop onto polish after top coat and they're dry in under 5 minutes!Note-- I also use OPI Rapidry Top Coat with this product, they work well together!"
2667,1,"I Love this Soap_This is the pure olive oil soap, the variety with no fragrances.  I do love all the Kiss My Face brand olive oil soaps that I have tried so far, with and without the fragrances.  The soap leaves no itch (my sensitive skin can testify), and the soap lathers up nicely.  I think this is my favorite soap.  I'll be using it for a while - all the varieties of it."
998,1,"Wonderful!_This product is really wonderful. I was looking for a highlighter to get the dewy, brightened look especially in the winters. I am fair and this product gives me the glowy look. It is a shine with a slight pink undertone. I would highly recommend it. One concern that I have with the product is that I noticed that it does not blend that well sometimes, but overall, it's great. Several people have commented on how my skin looks really healthy after I started using this."
4067,1,"great_I love this pony tail!!! Its long and thick and really looks fantastic! Its so, so worth the money and came with instructions for its care. I get so many compliments on it. It does take a little longer to reach the US but id buy over and over again. Its fantastic!"
1612,1,"Orly Nail Lacquer, Naughty Or Nice, 0.6 Fluid Ounce_OMG love this color nice dark purple! shiny smooth and glossy! Perfect alone or if you add a little glitter as a top coat! Everyone seemed to love the purple glitter combo!"
2172,1,"feels awesome but might not last very long_Alba is a great brand and I like many of their products.  This moisturizer has no scent, goes on super light and smooth, and absorbs very quickly.  My only concern is that it seems like this moisturizer doesn't last all day.  I have been having to apply more later in the day."
420,1,"Nice cleanser!_I use this with my Mia, as suggested by others, and it cleans nicely while being gentle on the skin."
9429,1,"Works Well_Does exactly what it says, boosts color in your hair. This doesn't necessarily dye your hair like a full-fledged coloring. Instead it makes the color that is already there brighter and more vivid. Cool blonde is a medium blonde, nowhere near platinum. It also conditions and softens hair.Don't use this in the morning - three minutes is a long time to wait after application. It is a good idea to have a timer to make sure you hit the three minute mark. You use this after shampooing and conditioning - that's kind of contrary to most regular hair color products. Instructions were followed and the results were perfect.The product doesn't really foam up at all. Start with about a quarter sized dab, working from roots to ends. That seemed like very little to use, but oddly it was enough. This is a squeeze bottle that is easy to control. Much better than a pump.The results were very nice - exactly the right amount of boost to extend salon visits.John Frieda website suggests that Cool Blonde should be used with shades named: Natural, Ash, Almond, Pearl, and Champagne."
559,1,"Nice stuff, obnoxious bottle_This is a great, refreshing, nondrying shower gel and it immediately became a favorite. My only complaint is the bottle- wide and flat and guaranteed to fall over for no good reason. You'll probably drop the bottle repeatedly getting the outer lid off, but there is fortunately an inner screw top. Next time I'll try to get a different-shaped bottle, but I will definitely buy it again. It's terrific stuff."
6747,1,"Great_Amazing quality. Totally worth it, surprisingly fantasic for its price. i'd get this even if it was 20-30 dollars. way worth it. way to go Evermarket"
3982,1,BEAUTIFUL_Love this color - it is amazing and I get lot's of compliments when I wear it.  It's almost a &#34;Tiffany blue&#34; but just a little more teal.
734,0,"Great concept but exceedingly short shelf life_I eagerly snapped up this ionic hair dryer about over a year ago because of it's retractable cord and folding capabilities. Even the price was attractive. It really did take up little room in my bathroom drawer and the retractable cord was a plus. I thought I had the perfect blow dryer because it did what it was supposed to do and quickly. Now for the bad news:  the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time. Then, the folding handle, low and behold, broke in half one morning. (Of course, the warranty had long expired). This dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and I consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers. When I've replaced hair dryers in the past, it was been because they've simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out.  I'd caution anyone to consider this before buying because these 2 features alone, while very appealing, can shorten an otherwise good hairdryer's lifespan.  I've now purchased a T3 Tourmaline (a featherweight, quiet hairdryer with no retractable cord or folding handle) which seems to work just fine and appears to have a much longer lifespan."
7186,1,"Great product_I love this nail strips, they just look amazing, there is no way they last 10 days, but what I do is to apply clear nail polish and then they last a lot ! Rally easy to put on."
4600,1,The only file set you'll ever use_Great product as I expected. I've purchased one of these before about 8 years ago and I still use it but the tip broke a little so I wanted a new one. These files last forever (as long as you don't break the glass).
3188,0,"Won't buy again_I have incredibly thin unprocessed hair that gets easily damaged by even a 'warm' setting blow dry. I'm also plagued by sensitive skin and break out with nearly every hair product I try. When I saw that Aveeno had a leave in conditioner it seemed like an obvious safe bet. At first I thought it was awesome! Light weight and hydrating. However as each day of blow drying went by the effectiveness wore thin. I found myself trying to use a little more than before, which lead my hair to be weighed down and flat while at the same time dried and full of fly-aways.I'll continue to use this at night when I need to add a little moisture to my hair, or on days when I won't subject my locks to heat, but if you're going to iron/curl/blow dry I highly suggest something stronger."
6480,1,"Easy, simple, and pure!_The Simple Cleansing Facial Wipes are non-greasy,all-natural disposal wipes perfect for the busy mom or teenager. With no perfumes or dyes to irritate the skin, they are gentle enough to use every day. They remove stubborn make-up and mascara very easily without having to vigorously rub the skin. The wipes are not too wet nor too dry. What I like best about this product is how my skin feels after using it. There is no oily residue or lingering scent. My skin feels fresh and clean.My teenage son really likes these wipes because they are ideal for usage after sports. Just throw them in the sports bag and they are good-to-go. They really help prevent break-outs from grime and bacteria found lingering on sports equipment.  Also, the packaging is gender neutral which is a big plus.If you are looking for a handy package of natural wipes for multipurpose use, I recommend this product."
6599,1,"Great tools for nail art_I use most of these tools, but am working up the courage to use the brushes more. It's that right hand that I can't seem to paint well!"
1627,1,"A perfect fall color, and almost holo!_This is a gorgeous, dark polish with bronze and brown overtones. Depending on the light I'm viewing it in (sunlight vs office or standard indoor lighting). In sunlight, it has an almost linear holographic appearance. It's not as strong as some of the Layla or Color Club holos, but it's still gorgeous nonetheless.I used three coats to get the polish to my desired opacity (I'm really picky about visible nail lines, and mine are always difficult to cover up). It removed easily as well, even with top and basecoat, and lasted 3 days before I got slight chipping (I'm hard on my nails, so this is a good thing that it lasted 3 days).It's now a staple in my fall colors, and it even goes well with my pasty white skin. I'd recommend it to anyone for their collection."
642,1,"Very good oil_I'm 39 and I've tried a LOT of different brands of skin care products.My skin type is combined ( dry and oily) and very sensitive to anything.I've been using this with facial cream ( mixing together) before bed for a month, and the result is incredible.All the pimples, white heads and flaky dead skins are gone and my skin is smoothest and healthiest in my life.I only wish if I'd known it earlier!"
3601,1,Great Product_This really is a wonderful product!  I use most of their products and love them.  It actually works and worth the money.
7632,1,Five Stars_Dry handy
8306,1,Affordable but 'High End' conditioner!_Suave has always been an afforable and reliable hair product. I was really excited when they came out with this 'high end' product at an affordable price. Who wants those high prices int he salons for 'product' when one can buy the same quality in their supermarket or drugstore for tless?I have use this as both a was hout an dleave in conditionaer and it works well both ways. I am 58 and my hair has changed in texture from 'silky' to 'wirey: . Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Depp Conditioning Shine Mask puts youth back in my hair without leaving it greasy.I HIGHLY reccomend this product!
8894,0,"Disappointed horrible results_The applicator is almost impossible to use, tiny hole and product is thick, viscous.  Smell not bad but results after the allotted 30 minutes were darker than I expected.  I use Garnier Nutrisse in 9, macadamia, and love the results.  Since they are both light blonde I did not expect to be a medium blonde/light brown!  My hair did not feel as soft while rinsing as it does with Nutrisse.  I won't purchase this product again.  I am thankful that my hair did not turn lavender or blue as some reviewers experienced.Update:4-8-13  in bright sunlight my hair has a greenish tint. YIKES!  If you mix blue with yellow you get green (see last line above for reference).Update July 9,2013.  After three months my hair is still extremely dry.  I have not colored my hair with anything since using Olia.  I have to use an oil treatment after every shampoo.  I have had two haircuts, trying to get rid of the colored hair.  This product damaged my hair.  Be warned."
7419,1,This shampoo is worth it!_Smells amazing! makes hair smell fragrant for hours! I love this stuff! It makes my  damaged hair soft. It works I think it is worth the money.
2341,1,"Love these for conditioning treatments_I often use oil on my hair, and while I love the conditioning benefits, I hate that the oil gets all over. These caps solve that problem. I have enough of these caps now to last for 2 years of treatments! Very happy!"
1052,1,"Cant write a review on a shade_But i have to say i always liked nutmeg color #28. Overall its one of the safest dyes. You dont have to hold it in your hair for 45 min like we used to back in the days, but only 10 min. I think its perfect. And color treatment included is amazing. Wonder if they sell it separately in bigger amounts because it smells great!"
492,1,"Borrowed and Blue: All the ladies love my fingers!_This review is for Essie's Borrowed and Blue, a very pale blue (not baby blue, but Easter/Spring/Summer gorgeous blue that makes your tan pop!)This polish is gorgeous. It's not too gray, not too white, not too blue. The pigment is well-mixed, does not go on streaky, had no trouble with bubbles. This is an OPAQUE color by Essie. Two coats is more than enough for coverage. Add a self-leveling top coat such as Seche Vite and your nails will look great for a relatively long time. No chipping and came off very easily with acetone--I think I was able to get away with using only one cotton ball to remove! It does not stain your nails (there isn't really enough pigment for that) and it's appropriate for work, beach, interview, you name it. If you have a tan, this polish will really pop!Highly recommended."
8508,1,"Strong manly scent_This shampoo comes out as a thick white cream, lathers well and does a good job controlling dandruff.  Both men in my house agree to this. I used this, too. But I also noticed the strong 'manly' scent, the scent of cologne that I could smell all day long in my hair.  It's not a bad smell, but one that resembles a strong, musky scent and is often associated with masculine scents.For men who don't mind, this product works well, but for men who prefer a more neutral smell, the strong aroma of this otherwise good shampoo may be a turn-off."
5851,0,"Okay for the price, but not comparable to high-end products_I got this because I wanted to see if it could be a cheaper alternative to my Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer. (Which I love, but at $43 for a tube, it's pricier.) The ELF tinted moisturizer feels very chalky and not easily blendable compared to the Laura Mercier formula. It wasn't awful, so if you cannot afford a high end brand it's acceptable, but it's not a dupe formula-wise. If you're used to high-end products, I wouldn't recommend this."
7426,1,"Gold in a pink bottle_My hair was a frizzy, dried out mess. I tried everything, all the big names... pantene, fruitis, John Frieda, biloage, matrix. If it said it helped with frizzy, unruly hair I was trying it. Then this little gem came along. This changes your hair. It makes it unrecognizable. My hair is now perfectly normal, shiny, healthy. The conditioner is heaven sent (scent). You will seriously not be disappointed. The frizz control is even better than this kind BUT I use this the most. It all smells delicious and your significant other will keep sniffing your hair. You might even keep sniffing your hair!"
3798,1,"Saved me from the salon_I was very anxious about trying this product, as a L'Oreal representative warned me that my blonde hair could potentially go gray-ashy (since I was using it after Feria 91: Champagne Cocktail) and reading a bunch of reviews saying 'It doesn't work' or 'It turned my hair green!'I used the Brass Banisher after lightening with the Feria 91 and seeing how my roots went to a pale strawberry blonde, as opposed to the champagne color that the rest of my hair was. I didn't want to bleach my roots, and I was reluctant to go to a salon. Because I had an inkling that this might happen, I had previously purchased the Brass Banisher and did a strand test. 10 minutes turned the palest part of my hair gray, so I stuck with timing 5 minutes after finishing the application on my hair (roots first, followed by lengths.)There was more than enough product, and the red is definitely far less in my hair than it was. My hair has gone a tad bit darker, but I am going to re-lighten it with John Frieda 9N on Tuesday or Wednesday in order to cover the patchy bits in the back that I missed with the Feria.I'm very pleased! No need to go to the salon! :)"
4182,1,I like them_Some of the stones are hard to stay on the nails but most of them are great with a lot to choose from.
1125,1,"Love it!_I have dry skin and this toner does everything I need it to do. I love the dispenser, it prevents spilling when you douse a cotton ball.  Dries really fast and my face feels smooth."
5388,0,"Dry and Hard_Cream concealer? On what planet?When I used this under my eyes, it was so dry that it tugged the skin no matter how much concealer I used. Also, it was way too light for my skin tone, and even under my thick Clinique foundation it still created horrible.Not worth the price. It went into the trash."
8978,1,Fantastic Price_This is an amazing price for such a great product!!  I love the variety of having 3 different choices to choose from!
473,1,"Great comb_I use this comb in the shower to comb out tangles.  Works great.  Good size and weight to the comb.  It's a sturdy comb and I don't expect to lose any tines pulling out tough knots.  The tines aren't sharp either, I've had some combs that hurt your head because they're so sharp.  This one is nicely rounded and easy to use.  Would highly recommend to someone needing a basic comb."
5086,1,"Very Good Brush_Awesome brush to apply blush or if u want foundation.Im inlove with Sigma brushes,amaizing products.I totally recomend this brush for a flawless blush application.A most have in every girl makeup bag."
8770,1,Another Great Dove Product_Dove really does make great hair care products.  I have used their shampoos and conditioners for quite awhile and was pleased to try the Leave In Conditioner.  I have straight hair that tends to go straight to frizz and odd curls in humidity.  Leave in conditioners help tame the hair and keep me from looking like I stuck my finger in a light socket on a lark.I found that this conditioner does as advertised and keeps my hair softer and with better frizz control and shine.  I will definitely purchase again.
688,1,"Great! (And a copy cat fragrance)_With all these white floral notes listed, I would normally be turned off ... but not with Bora Bora. After hours of research online, I finally decided to give this one a try for summer, and without a sniff ... I bought it. I am so glad that I did.Don't let the tropical island theme fool ya -- it's neither a fruit salad nor a pina colada, and it's not watery or island-like either. Many reviewers highlight the tropical flower notes -- I get those, but on paper. On me, it wears differently.Definitely florals & fruits, very well blended & difficult to pick out individual notes. Wears sweet. I can smell jasmine on top. There's a musk and/or amber. Perhaps bamboo & pineapple? On another website, notes listed are pink peppercorn, lychee, sand, mango, and musk. No single note dominates and nothing turns sickly, which is frequently a problem for me.Nice. Pleasant. Unique. Adult. Unknown. Exotic. Womanly.This is a mature fragrance, in that it is meant for a woman not a girl. It's got good lasting power, and a few sprays are lasting me a full day. However, it is a soft fragrance that stays close to the skin. Although I'll likely only wear it in summer, and occasionally as a pick-me-up in winter, this fragrance would be suitable year-round for many women.The opalescent glass bottle is beautiful & substantial ... but the plastic top is just plain tacky.At its current price, it's terrific value for a quality fragrance imho. In fact, I am so impressed with Bora Bora that I am sampling every LC release in the 2000s. Yup, Bora Bora is that good. Full bottle worth!.Rating: 5 out of 5.EDIT: Confirmed! Bora Bora is a famous designer smell-alike. I have penned 2 *unnamed*perfume* reviews with the observation, only to have them deleted. That said, the famous designer brand is smoother & rounder than BB, and it is muskier as it dries. Regardless, BB is a GREAT smell-alike at a great price. Search a bit online and you find the name mentioned."
1532,1,"worth the expensive_This tiny pot will last forever. You really don't need to apply that much. It does work for pale girls, too!!"
5861,1,"Best. Brush. EVER._This is literally the ONLY thing that will detangle my hair after a shower. Before this brush came into my life I tried detangling sprays, wide toothed combs, tangle teasers -- NOTHING has worked as well as this did. When I first got it, I decided to test it out by trying to comb through my hair mask in the shower, something I have never been able to do. The brush literally combed through my hair like silk. I have no idea why or how it works so well but I am beyond happy with my purchase!!"
601,1,"Very nice brush_This is a great brush for a very reasonable price.  The wood back and handle are lovely and smooth to the touch, comfortable in your hand.  The pins may feel kind of like plastic, but they aren't - they're bamboo, in a cushioned bed.  They go very smoothly through my fine hair, with no snagging or pulling.  The ends are rounded and feel good against my scalp.  I tried a boar bristle brush before this, but the bristles were too soft to get through my hair - this one does the job well.  One thing I really like is that the pins are not bulbous at the ends.  The old vent plastic brush I used to use had bulbous tips on the ends of the pins, which would catch lint and debris, which was nearly impossible to clean off of the brush.  This brush seems like it will be easy to keep clean and looking good.Definitely recommended!"
7612,0,"Disappointing_After seeing this color elsewhere I was so excited to purchase it. Well, I honestly ended up rather disappointed in the product after getting it and trying it out. Despite the color being so pretty in the bottle, something must have been wrong with the actual formula. As a devoted fan of Essie nail color I was a little shocked that the polish was streaky, extremely thin and washed out when being applied to my nail. I put 4-5 coats on and still the polish was a hot mess. I ended up taking it off and I haven't used the polish since. I'd like to think I just had a bad bottle, which was unfortunate because the color is so pretty otherwise."
2663,1,"Nice color_I like to mix the Natural Dark Auburn and the Dark Spice to get the perfect shade for my dark hair.  It creates a deep brown-auburn tone, not too orange, not too purple.  This seems to be a great option for protecting my hair... it doesn't feel as dry as some other boxed colors do, and it's always soft and shiny afterward.  I also kind of adore the smell of the little conditioner tube that comes with it.  Good stuff."
6818,1,Dual forms_These make filling acrylics a breeze!  They work with acrylic or gel and make my life easier at the salon.
5946,1,"GOOD_I have been using these brushes for a while...I would like to say they do pick up alot...so u only have to use a little on the brushes to put your make-up on...they clean very easy...they pouch is very cute and easy to clean...It can fit in your purse, tote bag, make-up bag...any where,,,I recommand this produce to anyone..."
977,1,"Nice eye cream_I like this better than other creams I've used. A little goes a long way. It really smooths out the texture of the skin around the eyes and helps with fine lines. Would purchase again, especially for the price."
3767,1,Perfect for small nails_I have it a four because it came messed up and a lot of them were broken but it is perfect for the small nails
4953,1,Five Stars_cool color
385,0,to much beige without natual covering_The price may be right but it doesn't work for me. I have olive tone skin color so maybe it works better on someone with fair skin. I find it to look thick and way to yellow.
1489,1,"Perfect_It gives the perfect glow. It's not big chunks of glitter, it's very finely grounded and it's such a beautiful shade. It will go with all the skin tones."
1404,1,Cannot Do Without It!_I just discovered this recently and plan to continue using it on a regular basis. It is an excellent skin calmer and works better with my Eczema than the bath treatment. Will probably add it to my subscription.
8415,0,"Poorly cut.._The glitter is uneven and full of snags and crooked edges.  I was lured in by the ultra-low price, but ultimately it's not worth it."
8804,1,As discribed_Item arrived and is exactly as pictured. My only little nit pick with it is they come in a little baggie. I'm not sure I considered how they would come but I just transferred them over to an empty spot in a wheel I have and i was good to go.
6186,1,Nice Day Color_This color is very close to my natural eyelid color with the sparkle added. I use it more in Summer and as an enhancer just over the eyelashes when i wear the Smoldering Plum. It goes on easily and really draws attention to the eyes.
161,1,"Love my Olay Total Effects_Yes, I love all my Olay products! At age 69 I have used several other brands to compare but always go back to my Olay the best. I always get many compliments on may complexion and I know it has to be in this product as I do work outside gardening and exposed to sun. I always remember to take pride in using this product last thing at night before going to bed."
7636,1,"RECOMENDED!!!_If you do nails for a living, on the side, or just for fun..... This mini glitter kit is FOR YOU! I love it. Not only was my order delivered on time but this is fun to use! there are several different types of glittler/mini glitter balls/ fun shapes (hearts,stars, moons,etc.) Plus if you use all your glittler the mini jars and BONOUS ! great for other crafts or necklaces.I love this Product and would recomend to anyone in the (Nail ' Business&#34; )."
917,0,Very little volume for thin hair._This mousse did not live up to its billing. Very mediocre. A disappointment from a usually reliable brand. Little body or volume here.
1722,1,"Aaah!  Hard to find brown!!  Absolutely NO clumps_I am fortunate to have found this in brown, as it is sometimes difficult to get this acceptable color.  This brown mascara looks good, it looks natural without clumps!  The mascara pulls out of the tube without clumps. It will lengthen enough and as you coat a little more, it remains easy to apply.  Washing it off is easy to do.As women gently age into their 40s or more, they need to realize that black mascara needs to be applied moderately, so go with brown.An attached mirror!What's neat is there is a mirror attached to the flat design of the tube.  Great for those who carry their mascara with them.There is NO smell that can be allergenic.  Brown is a good color, especially for the very-lite skinned women and for the darker skin, it blends in with dark eyes.  ....Rizzo"
2271,1,"Spice up Your Shower_It's hard to know what's best about Lush's shampoo bars.  They smell beautiful.  They're ridiculously economical and they last forever.  Really, this is one Lush product where I think you can't go wrong.  Lush's New shampoo bar sports a spciy, warming scent- think cinnamon and complementary spices.  It's a really unusual, but really exceptional scent for a shampoo.  The little puck fits in the palm of your hand, but don't be fooled.  These shampoo bars last just about forever.  So, don't be scared of the $9 price tag- you'll get $9 worth of shampoo."
907,1,"Works Nice and Smells Good_Reasonably priced and effective hand soap. I like the fact that it lathers quickly, and you don't need to use alot of it. It smells nice too. Highly recommended."
9425,1,"Restore Your Color even without the Dye!_First Off my hair isn't dyed, it is naturally multi-toned with red highlights. I thought I would try John Frieda Precision Foam Hair Color, Glosser Warm Red, as an experiment to see if I could enhance my natural red highlights. Guess what it worked!!! I used this once a week as directed and made sure to condition my hair and i had great results. My hair was at least 2 shades brighter in room lighting and in sunlight looked almost 3 shades brighter. The bottle has enough for 6 uses however depending on your hair length and thickness i would say it averages about 3-4.It's really easy to use just wash and condition your hair as normal, then apply and massage throughout your hair and leave on 3-5 minutes ( I recommend 5 minutes); and rinse away. Just as if you're doing a quick dye job.I absolutely love this product. The only negativity is when used excessively or without conditioner it can tend to dry out your hair a little  so I would use sparingly."
9912,1,"loved this sponge_I got this free to try.  I have to admit when I first got this I thought there was no way thing little hard rock would become a sponge and actually clean my face without hurting it.  But I followed the instructions and I was truly amazed.  After holding it under water for about 30 seconds it was a nice soft sponge.  It was very gentle on my face and best of all I could use my everyday cleanser with it.  Just get the sponge soft add your cleanser, clean face, rinse off the sponge and ring all the excess water out.  It even came with a hook so you can hang it up when you are done and it can dry the rest of the way.  I loved the hook, room on the side of my bath tub is very limited and this gave me little more room.  This was a very easy to use and very effective product.  My pours looked better after just one use.This facial sponge has Bamboo Charcoal added.  It is Natural and eco-friendly and when you are done with it is biodegradable.  The sponge is chemical free and ideal for delicate and sensitive skin.  The only ingredients you will find in this are 100% konjac and bamboo charcoal.  This is also a great price you only have to replace it every 2-3 months so this will last for a very long time.  It came with the hook to hand it up and dry.  This will help bring back the natural glow to your skin without all the chemicals other use."
6384,1,"very nice brush_Very fast shipping! This brush works great for lower lashes line. I love all of my Sigma brushes, very well made and do great jobs."
1279,1,"Best brush of all time, for long, tangly hair!_This brush is GREAT! How have I gone so long without it in my life?!I have very long hair, almost to my waist; it's also very fine, and tangles extremely easily, especially if I'm lazy with my hair care for a couple days. Previously, I had to use a leave in conditioner nightly (my favorite is its a ten plus keratin) not necessarily to condition, but just to detangle! Even with a detangler combing through my hair still took a good 10-15 minutes every night, which is annoying when I'm tired and want to go to sleep! My hair really doesn't need the conditioner on a daily basis, and would sometimes get greasy, especially if I don't wash my hair every day.I've used this brush on both wet and dry hair, and it's AMAZING! I do have a little breakage, but way less than before! Probably even less than the wide tooth comb. I use my leave in conditioner every other night now, and even on nights where I don't use it, my hair is still very easy to brush."
8373,1,"Nice subtle shimmer_This has the best scent, and the shimmer is subtle, not overkill. Leaves your skin nice and soft for hours."
151,1,"Works Great On My Baby Fine Hair. Ready To Use So Quickly!_Since I have baby fine hair that is kind of hard to curl, I purchased the 3/4 inch model of this Instant Heat Brush. What amazes me about this brush is that it heats up so quickly but does not overheat.So far, I have not forgotten to turn it off, yet I am so glad to know that it has an auto turnoff.One more thing I want to add: This does not tangle up in my hair and gives my hair softness and curl. And this brush is easy to clean also."
5257,0,Horrible_This stuff is horrible. Way to sticky. If it gets on your fingers it just has to wear off.Yuck
4864,1,Not very pink_I read the reviews for this color and one said that two coats would give you an opague pink with sparkle but that is absolutely not true. It is more clear than pink. I probably won't wear it alone in the future. It's more of a sparkle to put on top of another color.
40,1,"Skin, hair = multi-purpose!_This goes on soooooo easily and absorbs quickly into my skin.  There is a very slight shimmer upon application.  NOT greasy at all!!!!  Since this product is fragrance-free, I've also used it in my hair, and it works as well as the Fekkai hair oil I use.  It's thin so it would be hard to overdo it like lotion.  The only thing is that when I'm in a rush, some oil droplets find their way to the floor or my counter.  Easy peasy to clean though."
3345,1,"Good transition for a picky kid_My son is resistant to change, but being 9 and having a longer hairstyle now... I was excited to have him try this product because he's still using baby shampoo - which is fine but it does leave his hair hard to comb through since he doesn't use conditioner.  He doesn't like using our shampoos and conditioners because he's afraid it will 'sting his eyes'.  But he said he'd try this one because it 'looked safe for kids'.  He also said and I quote 'maybe this will be a good transition shampoo for me until I'm ready for the adult stuff'.He said he 'Loved the smell' but it seemed 'white and gloppy'.  (Keep in mind he's only used baby shampoo until now).  He said he'd like to keep using it though.  And he even wanted to make sure it was in the shower this morning so I know he likes it.His hair seemed a little softer I think.  It's hard to tell since he's the one that combs it primarily.  He didn't give me much feedback on if it was easier for him to comb."
4735,1,"Best brush ever!_The brush is incredibly soft and works perfectly with liquid foundation. I'm a clean freak so I clean my brush every other night and not exactly the gentle cleaning either and to my surprise, not a hair was ever shed! None of my older brushes could survive my rough handling and cleaning but I don't care, I've found my perfect brush forever!"
1034,1,"Great ridge filler._This is great for filling my deep ridges on my nails,and making them seem smooth and ready for polish."
3442,1,"Pleased with Olay_First of all, I had no idea how expensive this line of Olay products was when I requested it through Vine, so I feel extremely fortunate!  I've been using it for a few weeks now, and I can tell a difference in the texture of my skin.  It is brighter and it is softer, and there has been a diminshment of some lines around my eyes.  It's not greasy, and I do like that it has SPF 30 in the day lotion.  Skin absorbs the lotions very well, and the lotion is very light."
5796,1,"good hold, doesn't leave hair looking wet; only complaint is scent_I've used a variety of hair gel/paste/glue products, including some by Garnier/Fructis, Schwarzkopf/Got 2 Be, and Dove.  This styling aid from Axe does as good a job as any of the others at holding my hair in place (I have short hair that I mold to stand up straight on my head) and does it without leaving my hair feeling sticky or looking wet.  So far, so good.  My only issue with this product is that it has a little bit more of a scent than I would like.  It isn't that the scent is bad -- it's sort of musky -- but I just generally prefer unscented or minimally scented products."
7914,1,love these_Loved these diamonds. They were exactly as advertised and I was very impressed. It came on time and was in a neat package. Very pleased.
9251,1,I've given them as gifts and bought some for me!_If you have thick hair these are the best hair combs I've found.  They're great for those times you just want to add a little bling to your hair or when you need the extra control over an out of control style!I've purchased these on more than one occasion and in various colors.  I'll probably keep buying the different colors to use.
2188,1,Black people can use this product._I have brown skin and I'm very happy with this sun screen A) because it doesn't leave nasy chalkly ugly residue and B) it has an acceptable rating from EWG.  -Finally found a product to replace my Neutrogena brand that was full of toxins. Great product.
3241,1,"Curls Pop_There is absolute not a better gel that works wonderful for popping my curls right out and slicking my hair down, and I know because I have tried every gel there is even the ecosyle argan oil which nahh I did not like for my curls. Love it and will always buy it"
3290,1,"I love this!!_I've been using the C*Bella Organic Brightening Toner with Vitamin C and Enzymes two times a day along with the LaNouvel Cellular Hyaluronic acid Nutri Serum with Collagen / Elastin, Peptides, Dragon's Blood & Resveratrol and the Q'Lumiere Organic Day creme with Cucumber & CoQ10 in the morning & Aqua*Tica Organic Botanical Night Cream in the evening before bed.  The results are amazing.  My skin is so moisturized and no more blemishes...ever! I love it!!"
1914,1,"Love this lotion!_I really love this lotion. It works great, I get dry skin on my face all year around and so far I've been using it for about 2-3 days now and works great. I apply it about twice a day, after I get out of the shower and after I get done from outside.I bought it from Amazon because Amazon is cheaper than the stores around here."
2392,1,"Give it try!_I purchased this product in hopes to clear my skin, smooth fine lines, and reduce the appearance of acne scars. I have used this product three times so far, with each application 2 weeks apart. The first time I left it on for 3 mins, 2nd, for 4 mins and the 3rd for 6 minutes. The results are finally starting to show. My skin is 90% clear with no new breakouts. My acne scars on my forehead, chin and neck have soften GREATLY since the third application. the fine lines around my mouth appear softer as well. I would recommend this product for the serious beauty product junkie. It stings and has a slight burning sensation but it was far from unbearable. Follow the directions. Do your research. Take your time and make sure you have everything you need before you apply this product ie baking soda and water, towel, lotion, gauze, fan.. I love this stuff and I can't wait to use it a few more times. I have a good feeling that my skin will be as close to 100% as it will ever get with this product."
9143,1,Great!_I would reccommend this product to any one of my friends. I gave it 5 stars because it arrived extremely quickly (very happy about that) and the products appear to be brand new and untampered. Excited to try them out.
9847,0,"Stopped working on first use_I have a lot of really thin hair so I'm always looking for products that will give me volume. When I saw this I thought it would be an easy way to dry and curl my hair leaving lots of volume. Well I can't even say that I was able to give it a fair try as the motor blew out on my very first roller.I curled my hair around the large roller, turned it on and after about 10 seconds the styler when into overdrive for another 10 seconds and then completely stopped. I tried everything to get it back going including the reset button, moving outlets and trying it in another bathroom. Nothing brought it back to life. Don't waste your money."
567,0,"Boo hiss... another miss_After hearing a few people rave about how wonderful Wen was I ordered some for myself and was eagerly awaiting the day it arrived.  I got a shower that night and used it per the instructions.  I didn't have the wow factor after it dried and my hair seemed much more greasy after the fact.  I thought maybe I didn't do it right and tried it again... with the same results and this time my neck and back is covered in acne as well (which I haven't had since I was about 16).  I'm really bummed that this didn't work but not so much considering the cost.My hair is long, very thick and somewhat wavy.  I typically wash it about once every 4-5 days (normally my hair isn't greasy and doesn't like being washed much)."
6088,1,"Very nice makeup case!_I just received this in the mail today. Its very cute and is exactly what I need! I have a ton of makeup and my other makeup case is overflowing, so this was a great purchase, and will help me keep my makeup organized!"
2951,1,Great for the price_I bought these to use with my real techniques brushes and they work pretty well overall. You get quite a few brushes in the set and for the money I would say they are worth it!
7287,1,"feels good, penetrates good_I love this stuff, doesn't stink or burn eyes, I can use it first and then apply any other moisturizer, but usually don't have to. Works well if you are making your own serums, but if you put in fridge it will get hard since it's good quality. Really does help clear up your skin also."
4579,1,Super for fine-line wrinkles!_I love this serum.  I wish I would have ordered a larger bottle the first time.  I will next time!  The fine lines in my face have poofed up.  Love that!
4618,1,"Best Bath Bomb!_My favorite bath bomb thus far! The smell is incredible and light, and it leaves my skin super soft.  All HN bath bombs are good, but this one is the best."
2053,0,"Not so great_This product is not a great concealer, if you do have a bad dark circles it'll not hide it very well"
3529,1,"Light coverage, not too greasy_I like this product, as it gives light coverage, but I have found comparable product in Loreal Sublime for half the cost."
8362,1,"Nice_This purple is a lot darker then I imagined, not sure exactly what I was thinking.  But, its still beautiful."
6993,1,"Brush set w/ Case_This brush set is perfect for beginners to begin experimenting with foundation, blush, concealer, powder brushes.  Am very pleased with this purchase."
7173,1,"Harmony Gelish Magneto - Drawn Together w/ Matching Magnet Lacquer Kit_This was WELL worth my money for both products and again if you have all the right other things needed for a gel mani it will out just perfectly.  This seems to be a thicker gel polish so I can wear longer than other gel polishes.  I am very hard on my hands, I work all day, ride my bike, wash dishes, wash my hands tons of times and use my nails for a lot of things.  This is one tough polish and I would recommend it!"
336,1,Great for my heat cap treament_Here I received the 30 plastic caps which i use for my heat cap treatment.They work fine for me. They are big enough for my curly bushy hair.
9075,1,Wow!_This is a nice pink it is a true bright pink with a lavender undertone this is really a nice pink it also looks great with either Vegas Nights or Ambience glitter for that extra pop!
6085,1,Love them_Not sure if the lashes are human hair or not or if I can re-use them but I love them. I love the selection
4305,1,"Not greasy at all_I expected this item to be greasy, I've used cold pressed olive and coconut oil and experienced that uncomfortable heavy/greasy feeling until it absorbed.My experience with this oil is great and nothing like the above, it absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth. It even makes my adult acne go away when I use it regularly. It has a glass dropper which allows you to drop the oil onto your hand and keeps the contents sanitary.It also worked wonders on my son's sunburn - all around a great product, definitely worth the cost. I'll be purchasing the 4oz size next time as I find myself using it a lot."
5032,1,"Great value for such a quality cleansing brush_I have to admit I was really surprised by how well this Olay Cleansing System works. After using it for a few months now, my skin has never looked better. The brush is soft enough that it doesn't irritate my skin, but the rotating motion does a much better job of cleaning than just soap and a washcloth. I use the Olay Cleanser or occasionally some other liquid cleansers and am always amazed at how well it removes every trace of makeup and leaves my skin and pores looking spotless. My makeup seems to go on smoother after using it and it also helps keeps away the flakiness of dry winter skin. Even after a few months, I'm still using the original batteries and brushes, so it's pretty low maintenance. I considered the more expensive cleansing brushes, but with how well this Olay has worked for me, I don't see the need to pay triple the price for a different brand."
6547,1,"Must have brush_LOVE this brush, I won't live without it no. Perfect for blending out concealer underneath the eyes. Very soft, doesn't shed, shipping was fast. :)"
4887,1,"Thick, curly hair_First of all I love that this also protects against heat damage. I was hesitant against buying this since it was very over priced in stores, but then I found this on Amazon and had to try it. I'm so glad that I did, a little goes a long way and I Love the smell!"
9214,1,"shampoo_This is the best shampoo and conditioner, if I had not seen this on Amazon I would of not purchased a lot for the money and it really makes hair clean, shine and the conditioner is great."
4148,1,"I love this shampoo._I love this shampoo, leave my hair smooth and soft. It is one the best on the market. I love it."
6016,1,"Not good for the feet!_When I first got this product I was so excited to use it on my face for my large pores and on my feet.  The enclosed DVD is mandatory to watch, and it explains that not only can you use it on the face, but on elbows and feet as well. I was excited!  I need major help on my dry feet and that PedEgg just doesn't do it.  I've only used the device twice so I'll give my initial impressions and then return a couple months later to give an update.After viewing the DVD I used the device on my face at the lowest setting.  I am a medium-skin complexion Black woman, and after one pass with the want, my face was so pink it looked like someone had smacked me HARD.  The first time I used it I only did the right side of my face to see if my boyfriend could tell the difference.  There was a sting to my face after using it; the redness went away in about five minutes but the sting stayed with me for almost two hours.  It didn't hurt, there was just a sting.  A couple hours later when I saw my boyfriend, he said the right side of my face was noticeably smoother.The next morning I tried it on my feet and elbows. No dice!  On your face, the vacuum want gently pulls up your soft skin into the wand.  The diamond head is slightly recessed and as your skin is pulled in, you drag the wand across your face and the diamond head scrapes it.  On your feet and elbows, the vacuum is not nearly strong enough to pull up hard skin!The second time I used it on my face (two days later) the redness went away faster and the sting only lasted for as long as I was using it. Plus I was able to do it a little faster since I had gotten the hang of it.  I did my entire face.  I admit I do not see a difference yet but touching my face yes, there is definitely a difference! My face felt so smooth and baby-like.  I'll continue to use it 2-3 times a week and report back in a couple months!"
4894,1,"REAL STYLE_I'VE BEEN A WEN GIRL FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN I STARTED USING THE CLEANSER CONDITIONER.  WEN PRODUCTS PROTECT THE COLOR SO THAT IT DOESN'T WASH DOWN THE DRAIN.  IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT I USE THE STYLING CREME AND I USE IT IN ADDITION TO STYLING MOUSSE.  I HAVE THIN, FINE HAIR AND THE STYLING CREME MAKES IT EASY TO BLOW DRY MY HAIR WITHOUT ANY DRAG WITH THE BRUSH THROUGH MY HAIR.  EVEN MY HAIR STYLIST NOTICED THAT MY HAIR IS IN THE BEST CONDITION SINCE I STARTED USING WEN PRODUCTS."
1569,1,"Great Deal_I tried once .Is works very well,Can remove all of water profe eye make up .I'm gald I had this one"
6356,1,My skin is soooo sensitive!  This stuff is awesome!_I love this stuff!  I have acne prone skin and use just a pea size amount after a chemical peel.  It makes my skin pliable and stops the cracking around my mouth which can be quite painful when I try to eat.  I will purchase again if I ever run out of this batch :-)  It really does last a good long time.
6117,1,"Best value for the money out of all that I purchased._I ordered several nail art supplies ie pearls, flowers, and several different packages of rhinestones.  this one was the fullest, best quality, and came fast.  So many reviews for the same products can vary, but in this case, this product outshined the rest that I purchased in the rhinestone category.  Cheeky-Beauty was the brand and packaging."
3202,1,Fresh feeling_I love the peppermint and rosemary shampoo used occassionally by my hair stylist.  Ordered this body wash immediately after I saw it and now it's on my Subscribe and Save subscription list.
7466,1,"African Hair - Not Bad_Every once in awhile I don't need a super-rich therapy type conditioner. This works well for that for my thick hair. Suave type products leave my scalp itchy and uncomfortable. This worked well for a quick shampoo and conditioner. Because I don't, and shouldn't, wash my hair daily, I need my conditioner to keep my hair soft for a couple of days, and it did that. I did use liberal amounts compared to the small amount of the more expensive products. I also like the smell of it and love, read, love the shape of this bottle. It opens at the bottom which is just fantastic, and didn't fall over while I was showering. Those are two great pluses in terms of bottle design."
8226,1,"Flower headband_This headband is really cute. It took a while to arrive, and it's a bit small, but I consider myself to have a big head so I'm sure it fits fine on normal girl's heads ;)"
5976,0,"Didn't work_Have it, just sits in the drawer, didn't work for me. I'll stick to getting threaded. Maybe will try again."
121,0,"Smells like vomit_The first time I used this I put it on and within two minutes began smelling vomit. I thought my dog had thrown up somewhere so I walked all over the house with the mask on looking for vomit. When the timer went off I figured I'd look more when I get out of the shower and never found anything nor did I smell the vomit after I showered. Never associated the smell with the mask. The second time I used this I immediately noticed a vomit smell and put 1 and 2 together. By now I've used it four times and every time it smells like vomit, not kind of like vomit, just like vomit! The product works well enough, but considering it has fragrance as an ingredient I just don't get why it smells so bad."
5024,1,"Got this for Christmas_I love this brush! It is more gentle than my hands when using my scrubby acne cleanser. When using my hands (gently) with my face wash I get a slight rosacea flare up, but with using this brush, I get no flare up and my pores are becoming more clean and are shrinking! I'm so amazed! I like how this has a normal and high speed button, I haven't used the high speed yet since I don't feel I need it. But I'm I got this brush system for Christmas! It's fun to wash my face now, and it feel so good on my skin. I couldn't be happier."
8557,1,"I am pleased with this product. Worth a try._I am pleased with this product. I mixed it with a shea butter mixture I create for body lotion and hair product. I do believe it helped reduce some of the order of the shea butter that I don't like. However, I did use grapefruit and lavender scents with it. I have not used all of what I purchased yet so I plan to continue to explore.My mixture seems to be an improved with this product.Worth a try."
9432,1,"Very good_A relative who has a bold, red colored hair tried this.  She love it.  Simple to use and not messy.  It saved time and is cheaper than the salon.She recommends it."
8488,1,"Styling putty would be a bit more accurate_Axe styling gum is an extremely thick product. Definitely not like gel or mousse.  It reminds me of bacon lard at room temperature, which by the way is another wonderful styling product, if you don't mind the bacon smell.  It provides a nice hold if you like the organized messy look.  I have very fine hair and I did not experience the hard crusting that I get from other products, and it gives a matte finish so you don't get the glossy look."
3500,0,Not so great_I bought this so I would not have to use the plastic ware at work or risk loose utensils from home.  The prongs on the fork are to large and blunt.  The spoon is to flat.  Bummer
9165,1,Great lotion_Glad I found this lotion and tried it.  I used Acne.org BP lotion before and this is very much like Acne and cheaper.  The only difference is this lotion after it dries leave a thin white powdery film over your skin.  You need to wipe that off or apply a moisturizer over it to get rid off it.
7845,0,"pearl nail art_Got it today and all the pieces were the same size, not like the picture and description says. Disappointed in that big time. and two areas were empty. and the rest had from 2 to 10 pieces. very disappointed in that. the price was cheap and that's what this is, CHEAP. Don't bother buying it. better to go to a nail store and actually see in person what you are getting. Will never buy nail items online again."
1825,0,"Does not work very well on thick, course hair_I would not recommend this product.  Each time I used it, it started burning way too quickly (yes my scalp was greased up first).  My hair never came out as straight as it does with other products and the sub-par results it does give, does not last long. Typically I only relax my hair every 6-8 weeks.  I had to get a touch up in 4 weeks using this brand."
9021,1,"Review_I have used this derma roller for a few weeks now and really like it. Its been good with my sensitive skin. I think it takes 2-3 months to really know if a product works, so looking forward to the effects. Would definetly recommend the product. Thanks!"
4817,1,Great_Harmony products are wonderful and I will continue to order them. The colors are wonderful as well. You cannot go wrong with this product line.
4175,0,"Makeup broken_When I received this product all the make up was broken up and falling out. I called them and tried to get another one to replace it and I was told that it hadn't looked like that when they shipped it. I was furious, because they didn't pack it well enough to make the trip to my house in one piece."
9620,0,"Only good on really, really fine hair_I watched the video review on this product and felt empowered to give it a shot... despite the many negative reviews, I thought I could just follow the video reviewer's tips and be successful.I left the wax plugged in for nearly an hour, and when I began rolling it on, it was easy (it got stickier as I continued, but at least at first it was easy). Decided to do the bikini area because &#34;Go big or go home&#34; is my motto. I put on the cloth, rubbed it, pulled it off, and...NOTHING!I mean, not one single hair came off. At least the wax did come off easily, but it was totally useless.I thought I had to be doing something wrong, considering video reviewer had done this with such ease. So I tried again and again, in different areas. Thigh, calf. Nothing. Wait, no: one hair. I did get one hair. I want to be honest.After that stunning defeat, I decided to check on a new theory: Maybe Video Reviewer is not Italian. Maybe she does not have thick, well-rooted hair. So I tried it on the peach fuzz on my arm instead, and that worked reasonably well. I say &#34;reasonably&#34; because it didn't leave me with a bald patch on my arm as it should have, but it did at least take off about 50% of the hair in that spot on my arm.So, MAYBE if you have extremely fine hair, it might be worth trying. Otherwise, skip it."
508,1,"Great boar brush_I love this brush and use it for dry skin brushing. I has a detachable handle which comes in very handy for close areas and then the longer one you can use on legs or harder to reach areas, but it works very well and the boar bristles are great without being too hard."
9992,1,"Nice Moisturizer_Curel Rough Skin Rescue works well moisturizing dry skin. It has a pleasant scent and absorbs quickly into the skin. Unfortunately, it's kind of thin/runny, but that in no way negates its moisturizing abilities."
8403,0,"Doesn't stick_Maybe I just don't know what I'm doing with this stuff, but it's useless!  It doesn't stick, and slides around all over the nail.  When I tried to glue a gem, the glue caused the color on the tape to come off.  No good.  Glad I didn't spend much on it!!!"
1624,1,Truly in Heaven with this lotion!_I will never use another body lotion as long as I live! The scent alone got me hooked! It goes on so smooth and leaves my skin so silky and the moisture lasts all day long! It also preserves my tan so well! I love this stuff! Happy Tanning!
4296,1,"Fits in Barbie's Purse!_I knew it was little, but it was still funny to open the package and see it.  But you need only a very tiny amount of powder to help your hair.  If you find it sticky or need to wash your hair five times to get it out, then you're using WAY too much.  I sprinkle a tiny bit into my palms and rub it through my scalp.  And Voila!  I look like I have hair!  I can't believe what I've been doing to my hair (spiking glue throughout waist-length hair???), only to find this wonderful product.  My hair is soft and full and sexy and I don't have to blow it out or curl it.  My hair is extremely straight, thin and very long.  I didn't really expect this to do too much, but I'm so glad I found it!"
1561,1,Love it!_This is my absolute favorite foundation! It has a great matte finish and looks great almost all day with minimal touch-ups required!
3582,1,"Always in my purse_I've never even considered having an atomizer because I feared that I would make a mess, loose the funnel, or waste my precious perfume filling the dern things. This is just what the psychologist would prescribe (if I had an actual fear of atomizers).To fill it, you pop the spray cap/nozzle off your full sized perfume, then place the bottom of the atomizer on top of the 'straw' that the cap/nozzle came off of, then pump. Took less than 2 minutes to open the box, get my perfume and fill my atomizer &lt;3!!!For those needing visual instructions on how to use this, I actually bought this because I caught this youtube [...]She explains the product at about 2:25. The actual site [...] also has their own videos but the link above is what made me want to buy this.So far, I've had it over a month and I love it. I would like to point out that I did order the PINK travalo but the sprayer is BLACK not white as pictured. I prefer black myself but some people like to get exactly what they see.Hope you like it as much as I do!!"
9384,0,"The new prison favorite_*Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for BellaSha and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*Who knew that a simple brush would be so multifaceted?  Not only can you use it as a brush and a paddle, but, it easily converts to a shank and place to hide your stash!  Shank?  Stash?  Yeah, you read that right.  The sample that showed up at my place had a removable handle (see my Google+ page for video), which makes these extras possible.  Somehow, i don't think that was BellaSha's intent, but is a good indicator of their level of quality control.  If it weren't for the messed up manufacturing, the brush would be pretty decent.  Priced at eleven and a half (currently), it's on par with similar available in retain.  It's not some nice heft to it, and the plastic doesn't feel thin.  Perfect of detangling or a firm swat on the backside."
4667,1,"Works great!_My esthetician recommended this product.  I have combination oily skin and at 30 I break out like a teenager. I get black heads and deep acne pimples on my chin.  Prior to up until two years ago I had used proactive and it seemed to work great but either more hormones changed or I acclimated to it.  So I began to break out again.  Since I've been using this product my skin looks amazing.  Here's what she gave me and recommends:1.  For really oily skin use in am and pm.  Use Image SPF 30 Matte face cream in am.  The Matte will prevent breakouts.2. I use retinol mixed in with night cream in the evening.  The retinol exfoliates skin and helps with fine lines and break outs.3. This is potent and can dry out skin.  If your skin gets dry use only at night.  Also, you can apply Image's Vitamin C serum, which will restore your skin without breaking it out.4. Use the Mask as a spot treatment (honestly I use the Aztec clay mask instead and that is awesome and super cheaper check that out on Amazon)."
5989,1,"Very Pretty Color,_I am a makeup junkie, and I actually saw this on a vlogger on Youtube. I believe is was the Head Mistress. She does really pretty make up looks when she is on youtube.So since it was wet-n-wild I tried to located in my neighborhood,not so successful. I found every color; which I purchased, but not this one.I will say that it is dark, and matte, so please be aware of that. It can be worn with gloss or match it with another lipcolor to create another look!"
9422,0,"Not for my hair_I recently got my hair color treated and had heard from a friend that this product worked well. I used this product as directed in the shower, but my hair simply didn't take to it. The color still faded quickly from my hair. Would not recommend to any one with thick hair, but works great with normal and thinner hair."
6597,1,"LOVE!_I LOVE this glitter polish and the different shapes of silver in it!!!!!! I wish I knew about this particular glitter polish before, because it is great to use on my tips. LOVE IT!"
3031,1,"Great product line in general!_I've had this foundation brush along with the concealer one for over a year, and i really like them! They are affordable, adorable, and animal/eco friendly! No need to spend money on mac brushes or whatever, these are great! :)"
9418,1,"Powerful, lightweight, comes with nice accessories_This is a powerful and fairly lightweight hair dryer. The hot blows very hot, and it has a cool button to blow cold air. It comes with a nice set of accessories. Clips, brush, velcro rollers large round vent brush.Works nicely and fits comfortably in your hand. A good hair dryer."
35,1,"Wow that's luxury_My dermatologist friend has this all over his home... he's got two little kids.... so I figured there might be something to it.Bit pricey but I can see how this will last me awhile.... I like to use it on my drier bits... feet, knees, elbows, face, etc. I was never great about lotion on my face but when I've used this, it's been kind of awesome.... it just love that it feels so rich but so neutral... I guess that's the point... don't want it to aggravate the skin!So I figured I'd splurge a little in my mission to become better friends with my skin. I figure if I get a good running start now, I can look more youthful even as my body has other plans ;)Really like this cream!"
9312,1,"Simply Amazing_I just love this serum. its light, natural, fragrance free and  it does exactly what is suppose to do leaving my skin texture so smooth and so soft to the touch not to mention the great customer service! unbeatable!  I will re order another bottle soon."
6035,0,To bulky_I ordered this with my her styler wand and I used it maybe once. It's very bulky and made the job hard to do but it does protect your hand well. Would be better is it was tight fitting.
1236,1,it works_I had trouble with the proactive system but this spot treatment actually works really well. I use it every night before bed and can feel the difference in the morning.
9360,1,"Comfortable and easy to use_This foot file fits nicely in the hand and because of its shape moves nicely over areas like your heel and the ball of your foot.  I found it comfortable to use.  Short of a hand sander I'm not sure anything has the potential to get rid of my calluses but this did a pretty good job.  It left my heel smoother than it had been.  It certainly is easier to use than the long hand held type, which I am always fearful I am going to snap in half with the pressure I use.  I like that it can be rinsed but I did notice that when I used it wet, some of the grit broke away from the file but this seems to have stopped on further use.Overall, it is a comfortable file that does file down calluses BUT don't be mislead, regardless of what the package says, it takes more than 60 seconds for smoother feet.  It took several minutes on each heel and some aggressive scrubbing for me to get them to the point where I thought they felt acceptable. However, to be fair I walk barefoot ALOT, so my heels take a beating!"
8297,1,"LOVE LOVE LOVE_I bought this with the shampoo and I must say, Im very happy. I have dry, course hair and this conditioner makes it feel really nice. I like to leave it in and style my hair and it works out really well. Would recommend"
6424,0,Save your money!_Still mad at myself for wasting my hard earn money on this eye cream. I used this cream for almost a year and it did absolutely nothing.
4091,0,Not for photos!_The plus: the foundation spreads wonderfully and does not cake; the color is good (I bought the lightest shade).The problems and why I am not using it and will not purchase again: it is shiny! my face looks as if I'm sweating; and it's definitelt not for being photographed - because of the shine and because it has SPF that comes unnaturally in photos.
8008,1,"love!_VERY thin,but on lazy days I just throw them over my normal lashes & pack on some mascara & it makes a great,simple,beautiful look of full lashes"
1625,1,ANGEL KIWI PEAR BODY LOTION_Well this is my second time to order this product so that tell anyone that I like the product very much. It absorbs into the skin great leaving my skin feel the same.
7260,1,bareMinerals Readytm Blush- The Whisper_I bought this for myself I Love BareMinerals all the makeup is very nice again this is my personal chose to use and I will keep using it again and again.
6504,1,Mmmmmm_Smells like sweet powder with a touch of fruit and flowers. It works very well. Unique scent. I love it!!!! Great price!!!!!
2098,1,"5 stars for shine,  4 for moisture_My hair: relaxed, texlaxed, 8 weeks post, colored, and bleached. I got this product yesterday and decided to give it a shot after my roller set hair had dried. I bought this product mainly because it doesn't cause your hair to revert to its curly state. That is definitely true.  I used it immediately after taking down my rollers and also when I wrapped my hairlast night. My hair looks super healthy and shiny. I'm in love for that reason, however, there are better moisturizers out there. Since my purpose was to use it to maintain my straight look I'll continue to use. A little does go a long way. The scent is a little strong for my taste and does last a long time, but wasn't obnoxious enough for me to not use it. I would continue to repurchase though because I'm fairly impressed, especially because of its ingredients which is healthy for your hair."
5696,1,"These are beautiful and natural, but noticeable_I really enjoy these lashes. They are long, yes, but because they're wispies it doesn't look completely unnatural. I used black eyelash glue, and most people really couldn't tell that I had them on. They just said my eyes looked nice :)"
2465,0,It's a jip._I've used it once and I won't be using it again. It reeked of alcohol and I don't see where water or any other &#34;natural&#34;  ingredients in it will cause your skin to slough off. I tried to look the product up elsewhere on the internet and all I got was hype blogs from Japan.  An awfully expensive and embarrassing purchase frankly.
7601,0,Ehhhh_A bit dull! Not so great. But I guess they do justice for the price . Will not be ordering again . You get what you pay for
7692,1,Clinique Even Better Eyes_It is an excellent product.  I use it daily and would recommend it to others.  The larger size is a better buy for the money spent.
4827,1,"Not quite what I expected..._I'm giving this color a 4 because I do like the color; however, it really isn't exactly the color I was expecting. In the picture, it looks more red than it truly is. It's got a more pink/ rose tone than I expected. To me, it looks more like a ruby slipper color, which is what I was going for, but in reality it's not a true red. That being said, the glitter is really great looking and plentiful, and by doing 3 coats I got it to be pretty close to what I was going for. If you're not set on a truly red, red glitter, and just want a glittery polish that is their standard good quality, then this is a good one to try."
7455,1,"Worked very well for my fine, straight hair_I have fine hair that tends to fall flat, so you would think that using a volumizing conditioner would be a no-brainer, right?  Unfortunately, many of the conditioners I've tried in the past--usually branded as 'for fine hair,' 'body-building,' 'voluming-boosting,' or some combination of the above--have not worked well for my hair.  The problem is that these types of hair often do not condition my hair ENOUGH.  Given that my hair is fine and thin, it is prone to tangle and break easily, so I need a product that will condition my hair well without leaving it feeling weighed down.Unfortunately, finding the right conditioner has proved elusive, and I've switched products and brands over the years.  Therefore, I was quite impressed with CLEAR Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner, even with the very first use.  The conditioner had a subtle yet light, fresh scent.  The product itself was sufficiently thick, spread nicely through the hair, and rinsed easily.  But most important of all, I was pleased to see that my hair seemed less flat than usual after using this product.  I wouldn't say that it produced huge amounts of volume, but for my fine hair, simply having the conditioner leave my hair feeling soft yet not weighed down is a huge plus.I have been using this product with the matching shampoo,CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo, and the two products seem to be working well together.  The only (small) complaint that I have about both the CLEAR Conditioner and Shampoo is the design of the bottles--they sort of flare out, which make them difficult to push neatly together on a bath shelf and which give them the appearance that they are leaning over.  (I do like how the Conditioner opens at the bottom--but why not make the Shampoo open that way too?)Overall, however, I am definitely pleased with this product, and I plan to continue buying it as long as it keeps working for me."
2988,0,"Poor product!_I have used Maybelline products for a while now. I'm not fond of their mascara but their lipstick (semi permanent kind) is affordable and decent. So, I decided to buy this product. It is NOT waterproof and if you just move wrong it will smear all over the top and underneath area of your eyes. I use Bare Minerals and their vitamin mist and spray it after I've applied all my makeup, that really makes this product smear something awful! This is garbage and I hope Maybelline fixes the issues!"
4785,1,Amazing product!_Finally a descent beachy wave look! Definately the best waves ive ever had!!!! I definately recommend this product to all!
7822,1,Great color_The color is beautiful...no glitter...but it doesn't last for very long unless i cake it on...and if i cake it on i look like a clown so i choose to just reapply before going out at night.
9332,1,Rich moisture Shampoo for color treated hair_A really nice rich shampoo that cleans-- not strips-- my fine colored treated hairand that is so good to find for me because it does not dry my hair out ordamage my color and that is rare for sure.
7481,1,"Inexpensive, but leaves my hair soft and feeling healthier._This is the 3rd conditioner from CLEAR SCALP & HAIR that I have tried recently.  The first one didn't do anything for my hair, the second was an improvement and I continue to use it and this one is even better than that.With this conditioner I have been using it every other day for close to two weeks.  If I use it daily it makes my hair to oily, but on the other schedule it leaves it soft and feeling moisturized.  It rinses well and also doesn't weigh my hair down, which is good for my naturally curly hair.  Additionally I have had less problem with frizziness which is great here in the Northwest. One last note is I do like the smell of it; although because it rinses well it doesn't linger as much on my hair as I would like.Overall for the price I am happy with this conditioner and will continue to use it in a rotation with other conditioners that work well for my hair."
2604,1,MY BEST FRIEND_THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CONDITIONER! DEF TOP NOTCH COMPAIRED TO ANY SALON BRANDS THAT I HAVE USED. I SOMETIMES USE THIS AS A DEEP CONDITIONER! IT DOES NOT WEIGH MY HAIR DOWN AND MAKES IT MORE MANAGEABLE!
9237,1,one of the best WEN scents yet_the smell is amazing and lasts a long time. left my hair soft and manageable. perfect scent for the autumn
921,1,"Excellent_100% Tea Tree Oil. My significant uses this for his skin break outs and it does clear his skin and excellent product. I highly recommend you to try  this product, you won't go wrong."
1272,1,Perfect 10!!!_I love this little set.Easy to master and quickly becomes an essential.I prefer to use a powder brush for the bronzer for an all over sun kissed glow and a blush brush for the high lighter.The sexy sweep brush is very handy for on the go.Definitely a must have :)
6864,1,"Great Clipper, Good price_great clippers, really easy to use, good quality, and the price is so great. I would recommend if you are looking for sq nail tips."
919,1,"Yummy_I kept this one for myself since it was the first one that arrived.  It lasts so long, longer than any chapstick.  I'm glad I ordered this one!"
9435,1,Gives my color the boost it promises_I've used both this Cool Red and also the Warm Red and prefer the Cool.  It seems to have more 'umph' and maintains my home dyed color job better.  I especially noticed the difference in some photos that were taken at an event I attended.  Previously there was nothing distinctive about my hair in photos but when I viewed the ones taken at the last afternoon wedding I attended my hair looked lovely and healthy with an obvious glow.  This sold me on the product and I'll be using it in the future.
2384,0,clogs pores_it clogs my pores and also makes me sensitive to the sun when I wake up the next morning it also made my face a shade darker than my body but since I stopped using it went back to normalI have been going the natural route so I will not be repurchasing any thing more from this brand
3632,1,Richer than most safe ingredient conditioners_You have to use a lot of it and its pricey. It does condition better than most comparable products because its a deep conditioner but still leaves hair tangled. I do like their detangler though.
2641,1,"mirror mirror_i got this for my mom, we were not sure whether to get 10x or 15x...should have gotten the 15x.the mirror is great looking, nice finish and it's got some weight to it so it doesn't feel like it's going to fall over.it's great if you're looking for a 10x"
3671,1,"This was my favourite concealer before it was discontinued. :(_Very pigmented, works wonders on blemishes. I wouldn't use it for under the eyes though, because it is quite a dry formula. Lasts a very long time for the amount you receive. I wish they hadn't discontinued it. I would not recommend this for dry skin because it can accentuate any flakiness."
9765,1,Nice set with a closed carrying case_These are really nice make up brushes. I have been wanting to buy a set but have been putting it off. These are so soft and glide my makeup right on. The carrying case it comes in is really nice and easy if you need to take it with you somewhere. There is a nice variety of brush sizes for all different applications.
9348,1,Awesome_Awesome designs. Quality material. The full nail pattern requires some patience in lining up for wider nailbeds. Would order again.
1898,0,"Nice lashes but..._Created nice, big, long lashes, but definitely not for contact lens wearers. Smudged into my contact, and it would not come off with repeated rubbing with contact solution. Definitely not worth replacing two week wear contacts every few days."
9109,1,"Love the rounded shape_I've been using a clunky rectangular shaped flat iron for years and I had no idea how outdated it was until I received this one. First of all, this one heats up much faster than my original and I'm able to control the temperature digitally (an option that my old one doesn't have). The product claims that the rounded shape is designed to reach the scalp easier and it's true. I don't have the crimp lines at my roots that I use to have. Whether I straighten my hair or curl it, it looks great! This flat iron is so easy to use and I love it!"
2549,0,"Not for coarse hair._I am with those who do not like this set. I have shoulder-length coarse hair, and these rollers are very light and don't get hot enough to set a good curl. Oddly enough, the outer &#34;hold&#34; rings of these curlers seem hotter than the curler surface! So, for me, my fingers get burnt but my hair doesn't get curled. If it didn't cost so much to return them, I would send them back.I think this set might work perfectly for someone with thin or fine hair, as each curler is very light. I very much prefer heavier, denser rollers that hold the heat and set a firmer curl."
1555,1,"Looooove this..._I have been using this cream for about 3 years.I have fair, oily, acne prone skin.This moisturizer is light, it goes into your skin super fast and most importantly for me, no breakouts. It has kept my skin soft and clear. The jar is a good size and it lasts a looong time."
7339,1,Great!!_Purchased these since my daughter loves Hello Kitty. Stamps are work great and good size. just need to remember to clean them with acetone before the first use.
3695,1,line stiletto eyeliner_i love this eyeliner its amazing its so easy to apply and it doesin't hurt my eye when i apply it doesin't smear.
785,1,"Formula 2 protein!!_I bought the starter kit and honestly haven't used everything, but the Formula 2 protein polish is TERRIFIC!!  The bottles are really small, so it's an investment for sure, but it really works.  My nails are lovely and strong.  I am ordering another bottle of just the protein formula, it's better than anything else I've ever tried or had on my nails.  I would recommend the starter kit too, just because it's about taking better care of your nails in every sense, not just one aspect and think it's going to fix everything!"
1777,1,"Eye Brows & Lashes Are There Now_This really does help with brown and lash growth. May take a while, but it makes the brows and lashes more supple and therefore less breakage."
3093,1,"FOr hair treatments_I do DIY homemade hair tonics, masques, conditioning treatments to assuage my assaulted tresses.  Its damn cheap and few months into it has done the job every time."
712,0,"formula is to runny and didn't notice a difference_the formula is very runny I like a thicker cream consistency to moisturize my eyes to help stop the formation of wrinkles, also it burns alittle for me the concentrations in the product are a little high for me and irritated meI will not be repurchasing anything more from this brand because I have been going the natural route and It has been working so much better for me with more results"
8730,1,i loved the color_the clip is so nice heavy alittle bit but the peacock is very beautiful. its nice for accaions and events but not for daily use as its metal and heavy of the hair.
3209,0,Didnt work long..great dryer for acrylic nails while it works_Stop working after a month of use. Never been dropped replaced bulbs... Tested wiring. no fire at all. Jusy stoppef working out the blue. But while it worked it dried nails quickly:-) :-) :-) :-) :-)Takes less than five minutes for two coat nails;great polish dryer for acrylic nails
2819,1,Always timely!_I've ordered this like 3 times now (for the bf). He loves this stuff! And loves he has such a large supply! Each one lasts about a month. Definitely recommend if your bf uses it. Its always horrible when the bf runs out of hair putty and then looks so discheveled.
5436,1,Great healing Benefits_A great way to relax in the bath and to detox your skin as well. It dissolves nicely and has a light texture.
343,1,"Exactly What I've Been Looking For!_I put this lotion on for the first time 5 minutes ago. It is AMAZING! It absorbed immediately, with no greasy residue. It smells incredible, feels incredible, and I love that the first three ingredients are water, coconut, and aloe. Consider me a customer for life!"
4756,1,"it's good i think_i always get grease particles at my eyes area when i used the eye cream which are too heavy, but this one is not greasy, i can use it with no worry, results still need to wait. i used it for about 2 weeks"
3408,1,"Smells nice, feels good_I liked this lotion.  The scent is light and pleasant. (OK, I know that sounds bland and hokey, but it's nice!)  The lotion absorbs quickly, however I live in a desert and use almost constant air conditioning.  My hands are normally so dry that they will absorb almost anything.  The nice thing is that it seems to take a while before I need to reapply.  I do think it's a little expensive for what you get, which is why there are only 4 stars in my review.  It's good and my hands feel soft an hour after using."
8425,1,Cleans Hair and Scalp Well; Light Fragrance; Good Value_As a man what I look for in a shampoo is a rich and cleansing lather that leaves my head and hair feeling clean.  I have also been looking for a shampoo with a pleasant fragrance since the Prell my wife has been buying lately is too assertive.  Dove markets this product on its container as removing grease and revitalizing hair and as being a 'fortifying shampoo and conditioner.'  This product meets that claim well enough.  Active ingredients include caffeine and menthol: there might be a slight hint of menthol in the fragrance but should you lather your bum with this you will get a tingle.  The menthol does not tingle the scalp.  For years I have used a salon product but it has grown to be quite expensive This will be my regular shampoo/body shampoo until something better comes along.
7670,1,LOVE IT_So far so good.  I only received my shipment a few days ago and have used it a few times.  So far it does what it says.  My hair is soft but not oily.  In the morning (before showering) it does not look dirty. I may be able to go longer periods of time between washing.  I look forward to trying so of the other scents.
5598,1,good_i use this as a stamping polish works great the polish is not hard on my nails either. love it
6357,1,"Manicure set_I bought one a year ago for alot less, so when it gave out, I spent a little more, and have not been sorry in the least!!"
7848,1,"Too Faced Beauty Editor Darlings Kit_The mascara is amazing! makes your eyelashes look awesome and it will stay in place for hours.The eyeshadow primer will make your eyeshadow last for hours, and it will look like you just put your makeup on.The lip primer is really great too, it will make the increases on your lips dissapear and will make the lipstick stay on longerThe poreless face primer I think is particularly good for my T zone, cause it will make my foundation and powder look better for longerMy least favorite is the lip plumper cause I am a bit picky when it comes down to things with mint, and I think this one has too much mint on it sort of speak. But if you like mint you won't have a problem with it."
7414,1,"Generic flattering pink, matte, good quality..._I have a light-medium skin tone, and found this blush to work better than I had expected. It seems to be the mid-tone from the Balms blush line-up. I powder over my foundation (cheeks and t-zone only), and this blush performs well. I keep my brushes very clean, and this is a decent quality product with forgiving pigmentation. (Read: not too strong or weak, easy to work with.)Bottom line: if you are looking for a basic pink blush, this could work for most people."
8803,1,luv it_I bought for myself n sister in law n we luv it we're already guna buy some more cuz we are all out will be buying more from this seller
5149,1,just the best!!_this stuff feels great going on. it feels like whip cream going on. color is perfect. it looks natural and lasts all day. will be buying again for sure. have always used some kind of LOreal  foundation makeup.
3474,1,"Best ever!_For me this is the best mascara I have ever used!  stays on, easy to apply, does a great job on my lashes. Price wise  some may find it expensive but  it is worth it. It lasts long time and does what I need it to do !  On my 3rd one in 2 years! highly recommend"
5613,1,"Reliable in the Hawaiian sun_I bicycle and garden a LOT. This is the only product I've found that doesn't wear off easily, though I probably should reapply more often due to sweating on hot days. I'd like it if there were fewer chemicals, so I'm trying a more natural product, but I do find myself reapplying it far more.Oh, and watch the 'bleeding' into the eyes if you get caught in the rain, for example. Ouchy."
2535,1,"NO PROBLEMS_THICK, NATURAL COLOR, COMFORTABLE. I NEVER USED A WIG CAP BEFORE. BUT I GUESS THIS ONE IS GOOD ENOUGH TO TRY"
7311,1,"A nice consistency_My husband has psoriasis and I have to keep T-gel on hand for him to keep the itching down, but it stinks.  This works just as well and has a light, pleasant fragrance that he remarked about right away.  I love the consistency, which is like a lotion and it lathers well."
3358,1,"Great product although mine came in a giant plastic bottle_I love Ms. Meyers products and love the soap refill because its better for the environment.  This came in a plastic bottle instead of the collapsible bag, which was disappointing.  This also is only enough to refill your soap dispenser about 2.5 times.  I also prefer the lavender scent, although the basil is not bad."
5359,1,Elf mineral face primer_i love this primer it makes my face really smooth so my foundation can go on easier and it works great with a brush
1244,1,"Very Goof Hairdryer_This is my second ionic hairdryer (I reviewed the other one as well), and I finally got what I expected. It dries my hair quickly and leaves it very shiny. Sufficient choice of settings. They advertise it as extremely lightweight, but while it is lighter than the other one it is still no featherweight. Love the angle of the handle on this one; it balances well. My only real complaint is not so much the placement of the buttons, but their 'M.O.'. If you have buttons in that location it`s better they slide. I don`t know the technical term here, but these tilt (or dip) and until you get used to it, often by accident."
1026,1,"Definitely soothing_This helps to reach the dry patches on your back during the winter months and helps to calm the dry skin, but with regards to pregnancy-related stretch marks, after about 2 weeks of consistent use in combination with the massage cream, I haven't noticed a significant reduction in stretch mark appearance... will keep trying though."
4820,0,Not impressed_I would not purchase this again. It did nothing for my little scar I had from accidentally scratching my shoulder. Waste of money.
6742,1,"Work Well!_These strips are easy to use, and perform that task that they are intended for. If you are using Retin-A, do not use these strips. Your skin is already softened and peeling during the uses of Retin-A. Using these strips will pull too much skin from your face and cause bleeding."
3600,0,NOT GOOD_I USUALLY USE CLINIQUE TAKE THE DAY OFF WHICH IS AMAZING THIS PRODUCT IS JUST OIL AND WATER AND ALCOHOL DONT EVEN REMOVE REGUALR MASCARRA
2196,1,"Feel good clay powder:)_I purchased this European Clay Powder on 6/15/12 and received it today, 6/20/12.  I used it and I let it stay on my face for approximately 10 min. After I washed and rinsed my face, it felt sooo good. This was my first time using a face mask. I will definitely by purchasing this again before I run out."
639,1,"I get these all the time since I like to see the results_I get these all the time since I like to see the results, you can literally see little bumps afterward where your pores have been cleaned out.."
3030,0,not good quality_unfortunately this brush was nothing close to the ecotool qualityit sheds like crazy.. with one pull more than 10 hairs felt downI hated itNot good quality at all&#8230; although I have the bronzer ecotool brush which is amazing and I thought this one will be same quality!!! I don&#8217;t know may I received a fake ecotool brush or this brush is not very good qualityshipment and handeling was good.. fast shipment also
3706,1,"good soap if you're trying to avoid the flowery smells_This soap doesn't make a great lather, but it does get your hands clean without a lot of harsh chemicals and terrible smells. I also used this soap to clean out pump parts when I was breastfeeding, because I didn't want to get chemical smells in there!"
1269,1,LOVE LOVE LOVE!_I absolutely LOVE this dry shampoo and try to always have some on hand. It adds volume and makes your &#34;less than squeaky clean&#34; hair look amazing. All other dry shampoos have never given me the great results Batiste has!
4831,1,"PERFECT everyday polish!  Love the color!_It goes without saying that Gelish products are great and allow you to do a long-lasting, salon-quality home manicure.  This polish goes on smoothly and lasts forever.So -- the trick is finding a color that works for you, and it's so hard to tell when shopping online!  I have eight Gelish colors now, three of which are pale pink, for what I intended to be a neutral , everyday manicure.  Taffeta is my favorite of those three colors and even when I try one of the others, I invariably go back to Taffeta.  Taffeta is a sheer, shimmery pink.  It does not add a lot of color to the nails, but gives them a nice sheen.  It has a little glitter or iridescence, but it doesn't look glittery at all.  It is not opaque.  I can still see (although barely) the white part of my nail through two thin coats of Taffeta.Other similar colors I have tried include Light Elegant and Pink Smoothie.  Light Elegant is very similar to Taffeta, but it is a little more glittery.  I think Taffeta is a tad more understated than Light Elegant, and the little pieces of glitter or shimmer are much finer in Taffeta.  Pink Smoothie is an opaque pink with no shimmer.  I have used Pink Smoothie for a first coat and Taffeta as a second coat, which gives a more opaque finish than Taffeta alone.  Of those three, my first choice is Taffeta, although Light Elegant is similar and a close second.  If you're looking for more color and less sheer, then Taffeta is not for you.Hope this helps -- it is so hard to really know what colors look like in person based on a little swatch of color on the screen."
9504,1,"Gentle, Delicious-Smelling Shampoo and Conditioner that Enlivens My Adult Hair_Years ago, I went to a dermatologist for treatment of my Male Pattern Baldness (MPB).  He suggested that I use children&#8217;s shampoo and conditioner because it is gentle.  Harsh, abrasive cleansers will damage my hair, causing it to fall out of my scalp.  Furthermore, children&#8217;s shampoo and conditioner doesn&#8217;t sting my eyes.I have to use a conditioner every day in order to prevent dandruff.  At one time, I would use the shampoo first, rinse it out and then add the conditioner.  This was time consuming and sometimes, if I wasn&#8217;t using the conditioner every day, I would forget the last time I used it.  2 in 1 is much more convenient and affordable.  Packing for a trip is easier when your shampoo and conditioner are in one bottle.The Suave Kids 2 in 1 Peach Shampoo and Conditioner smells great.  I love the smell of peach.  My favorite scented Yankee candle is Juicy Peach.  Whenever I open up the bottle of Suave 2 in 1 Peach, I think of the Juicy Peach Yankee Candle.  I must warn you that the shampoo and conditioner pours easily out of its plastic bottle; it doesn&#8217;t ooze out like most shampoos and conditioners.  However, it lathers very well.  A small amount will go a long way.I haven&#8217;t had any dandruff since using the Suave Kids 2 in 1 Peach Shampoo and Conditioner.  My hair looks and feels healthy.  It is shiny and lustrous.  I highly recommend this hair product for men who suffer from MPB and need a gentle shampoo and conditioner.  In fact, I believe all adults can benefit from it.  I strongly believe that it is best to cycle your hair products in order to prevent your hair from developing a tolerance towards one hair product, eventually rendering it ineffective.Joseph B. Hoyos"
2348,1,My favorite!!_This dries so fast and leaves a nice shines coat. By far the best top coat I've ever used. Love it!
9758,1,"Girlfriend's Skin Looks Great!_I got this for my girlfriend (At her request, not because I thought she needed it, because she's beautiful). However, i will say I've noticed her skin looks great. I can't pinpoint it, but something about her skin is just different, better. The color, if you will, just peaks. I would recommend this. Guys, your girls will look better!"
1974,1,"Great for Rough Edges_Salon Nail File, Coarse / B000ZMCNFII keep two nail files in every room, this Salon coarse file and the Salon fine file. The coarse file is perfect for quick removal of rough, cut edges and other imperfections. The fine file is used after the coarse file, to mellow the rough edge and give a soft satin finish. I really can't imagine maintaining my nails without both - the coarse one, used alone, leaves your nails feeling slightly rough and scratchy, and the fine one, used alone, just doesn't have enough firepower to handle the rough edges I get after a long day of gardening, pet training, and general nail abuse.~ Ana Mardoll"
6596,1,"Love this nail polish_I have misplaced my first bottle of this nail polish so this purchase was to replace it, I've familiar with it it's beautiful with a light under coat of another pink or even white underneath.It does chip kind of easily though thats the only set back of it."
9968,1,"This is the best clay mask I have used!_I really love this clay mask!  It definitely cleared up some of my problem areas, and my skin felt so good after using it!  I will certainly be using it again!"
4733,0,awkward_I bought these for my nails and they don't work well for me. While they hold quite a bit of polish remover they leave a lot of fibers behind with thicker polish or polish with any type of glitter.
6509,1,"Works well at a bargain price_My daughter first bought this at a local store.  She has been using dry shampoo for several years and was hoping to find an inexpensive alternative to the one she had been buying.  This ended up being just as good as the others and when she went back to purchase more, the price had almost doubled.  When I came to Amazon I was pleased to find it at a reasonable price and it also had a coupon available at that time.  We will continue to buy it here and I hope at some point that it is added to Amazon's Subscribe & Save program."
6429,1,so cute_It does the jobIts small but able to put liquid acrylic in itI would just see if they can wrap it up in bubble wrap or somethingSafer cuz mine came  in usps wrapped in news paperBesides that great product.
2921,1,Great_Family loves it. From the oldest to the youngest males and females. A good buy for all. I recommend it.
8836,1,Haven't used it yet._I haven't used it yet but I'm excited that it doesn't have a horrible smell to it. I'll probably update it when I use it for my wedding!
5516,1,"Full Size Product!!_This is a great value.. full size product for less than the mini size available at Sally's Beauty Supply. Some people say you don't need this product, but my nails stay on perfectly when I use this."
5957,1,"Finally found my perfect sunscreen_Here's my story as it relates to sunscreen: I have brown, acne-prone skin, I live and commute every day in the desert, and a close friend in their 20s was recently diagnosed with skin cancer, so I have gotten neurotic about sun care. I have read a lot of research and tried a lot of products. This product is currently my favorite. Here is why I feel that way for me, and hopefully it helps you too:*This product does not make me look too pale. I also really like 'Fallene Cotze Plus SPF 58 Water Resistant UVB/UVA Sunscreen for Sensitive Skin,' but while using the Fallene product (even with make up over it), my boss kept asking me if I was feeling OK, and I was confused until finally he straight up said I looked pale, lol. I realized that either I needed to buy a different sunscreen or darker make up to compensate. This product, due to being a lower SPF, has caused me no such problems.*Even though this is a lesser SPF than some mineral sunscreens, it is still more than the 10 or 15 in many other day creams and make up products.*The 'gel' part is nice. I wasn't sure what to expect from a 'gel' sunscreen and was afraid it might dry my skin out too much in conjunction with other acne products I use, but this is not the case. I don't really know how to describe it; I probably would not call it a 'gel' because of its consistency and tint and because it doesn't seem like other 'gel' products I have used but it also does not seem like normal water resistant sunscreens. It feels like my skin can still breath, is the best way I can describe it.*It does stay on even through sweat (did I forget to mention my car that I commute in through the desert has no air conditioner?) and does the trick at preventing sunburn for the several hours of the day I am out during peak sun rays. I know it says to reapply every few hours and I am in fact a public health professional and therefore endorse this advice; however, to be honest I, like many other people, do not follow this advice because it would require me to reapply all of my make-up every two hours. So as far as I can tell, this product stays on a long time and is water resistant, but follow the directions if you can.*Speaking of make-up, this product is not as 'tacky' once applied as other mineral sunscreens. I assume this is the 'gel' effect. This makes it easier to apply make up over (compared to Fallene, for example), though I will admit that I still use more foundation that I do without sunscreen. However, this sunscreen still acts like a base, so the foundation goes on evenly and all my acne discoloration is covered.*This sunscreen has not made me break out in any way.Those are my main observations, after using this product for about two months. I know it is somewhat expensive but I find it a good buy, when all factors are considered. Also, when I bought it, I got a cool color-changing UV reading card! I don't know if that comes with every box but I thought it was neat."
4484,1,"I love this stuff!_In the south ( AL) , powder is a necessity! I use baby powder for years but was nervous about talc, I liked this scent so thought I'd try it- It smells wonderful! And the cool thing is I can use it on my upper body ( menopausal!) and to avoid waste I use tons of talcum on lower areas w no clash of smell- its much better than my old standby and also with the scent I bought ( clean original) it truly does last much better! I hate most perfumes, they give me ( & my bf) a headache- this smells a bit like I bathed in gain- but better! I read these reviews before buying and the fact that it ' layered ' well was a big + for me- thought I'd ' pay it fwd' and say it is worth the extra $$$ to me!"
2300,0,"Love the Idea But . . ._I initially bought this item because I loved the idea of a product that wasn't tested on animals and it was organic.  However, this was also my first tinted moisturizer I've ever had and overall I wasn't really pleased with it . . .The amount of coverage was decent at best.  The formula was greasy and immediately made my oily face look even more oily.  As you can imagine I already wasn't pleased.  Looking at the reviews before I bought it, I noticed that almost everyone seemed to comment on its Lavender scent.  Though I usually like the scent of lavender, the smell of this tinted moisturizer was really strong and it really didn't smell much like lavender to me.  Furthermore, the applicator for this product was on the poorer side.  It was difficult to get the right amount of product out because it was either too much or too little and sometimes the product would flow back into the tube before you could get it.I won't be purchasing this product again.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I recently bought Neutrogena's Tinted Moisturizer and it's amazing! I totally recommend it : http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Healthy-Sheers-Light-Ounce/dp/B001TSLK60/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid;=1336176965&sr;=8-3"
1713,1,Awesome!!_These are the real deal at a super good price!!  I have use these and the sensitive skin ones and prefer these much more.  They came in their original box brand new.  I can't believe how good the price is.  Thank you!!!
2787,1,"One of the better creams I've tried_First off, I utterly despise creams. I very rarely use them, even if my hands are chapped and bleeding. The reason is, I hate how they smell, and I hate how they feel. Most stink so bad, you can smell it from across a room. Yes To Carrots Butter is actually one of the best 'non smelly' creams I've tried. To be honest, there is a smell, still. But it is virtually unnoticable and perfectly acceptable, for me. It passed that first, and very important test.The other reason I rarely use creams, is the greasy texture that they leave you with. No matter how supposedly absorbent they claim to be, I can still feel it sitting on my skin all day. With this cream, it really isn't like that at all. I tried it on my legs that are very rarely dry. But since I've been doing Laser Hair Removal on my lower legs, they tend to get a bit dry after a couple of days of the laser treatment. So, I started with a little bit of this cream, and the dryness was gone, visually, and it didn't leave any gross greasy residue.I tried using it on my hands, but it did start to bug me after a few minutes. I guess I am just not used to it. Even the none-smell was getting to me. So, I think I will continue to still use it on my legs, since that seems to be working perfectly. All in all, for a cream, it passed my specific test and I would recommend it to anyone with moderately to very dry skin.Even for a pack of 2, this cream seems a bit on the pricey side for me. Again, I am not used to spending money on creams, so in actuality, this may be a pretty good price for it, especially if it does what it is supposed to do. I would estimate that one tub of cream lasts about a month, if you use it daily, and depending on the area."
2433,0,Nah_I have the brown color of this liquid eyeliner and I can't even notice a difference that it was brown. Looks black when applied. Also it seems a little watered down so when you apply it you have to put 2 coats because it leaves streaks where it missed the first time. You can get a better liquid eyeliner so don't waste your money on this one even though it's cheap.
8377,1,Spongtastic_These sponges apply make up and body paint seamlessly.  I love the shape and how they sit in my hand.
9053,1,"This one I like......_Goes on nicely.  No obnoxious fragrance.  I put this on first after cleansing my face and then follow with another moisturizer.  I use so many different 'anti-aging'/'anti-wrinkle' creams that I can't say for sure that this one does the trick all by itself but I do get a lot of compliments on my 57 year-old skin that looks like 40-something.  I do believe that using multiple products, of this nature, provides better results than using only one.  What one product may lack, another will have so they all work together to give me superior results.  This one is nice and I will order it again to be part of my multi-product regime."
8110,1,"Good shampoo, not 'glossing'_This is a good, effective, mild-but-not-moisturizing shampoo.  For me, it seems similar toNexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Shampoo, 13.5 Ounce.  I prefer the scent of this Christophe shampoo for its mild citrus aroma.  Although this shampoo is more expensive than a drugstore brand, it is also quite thick in consistency.  I think it is a good value.I should note that this shampoo has no 'glossing' properties.  It's mild.  It will get your hair clean but not stripped.  To get shiny hair, you'll need a conditioner and probably a styling product.  Many cosmetic companies exaggerate product claims, so I don't deduct point for that here."
5950,1,"Great Hair Product_I use this product every time I wash my hair.  I have thick, wavy hair and this is the first product that I put on.  It is a wonderful conditioner and leaves my hair feeling great.  It also has a delicious smell.  I believe it would work well for any type of hair - thick or thin, straight or curly."
9698,1,"It's great!_I like that it sudses so well. I can use a very small amount and it still minimizes tangling during shampooing.  I still do use a cream rinse, but I'm not sure that would be necessary...it's a habit!  My hair is not tinted, but a friend of mine says it seems to protect her hair color between retouches, prevents fading.I would recommend this to everyone."
1496,1,"I feel soft_I've heard so much about this brand on my favorite beauty blogs so I had to finally give it a try. I like it very much! This is not an everyday skin cleanser- you're only supposed to use it twice a week. I will say when I use it my skin feels very soft. It doesn't take much to clean your face so this bottle will last me a long time. There's no smell, and I can have sensitive skin and I had no reaction to this. It's a great face cleanser for the price. I'm going to try more from this line."
7549,1,"great product makes healthy hair,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,_spray it on,,,,,scrunch it up,,,,,,,,,,,or blow dry either way great hair product, love the soy hairspray too, shine is incredible, hair is touchable, highly recommend it"
4851,1,Gelish - Vegas Nights_Such a pretty multicolored glitter!! I bought this clear glitter polish to cover some of my other non-glitter colors. Such a fine glitter without looking to 'tween'. Love it!!
8274,1,"Very good product_Sinc&eacute; I read good reviews on this, I decided to order it. I bought it in Supertar shade and when I first applied it, I realized that one pump size was too much for the results I was looking for, so, for me, using a very Little dot size does the trick!Is very pigmented and feels good on my skin.btw, this is my boyfriend account lol."
835,1,Fresh scent_If you like BRUT deodorant body spray then this is a more potent version in the form of cologne.  Nice fresh bright scent that is not overpowering.
7478,1,Works as designed_This is a specific product designed for a specific customer.  If this is the type of product you use then it works well and is reasonably priced.
5377,1,"Nice set_A great set to get. Love the small nail designs, not that impressed with the full nail. Would buy again."
5945,1,"great idea_these brush guards are perfect.  while i was using thread socks for my larger brushes, i had nothing for my smaller brushes.  these are very sturdy and allow me to dry the brushes upside down in a mesh pencil cup bought at the dollar store. because the pencil holder is mesh, the brushes dry much faster than in a glass.  i love these so much i think i will buy the larger brush guards for my large face brushes, my kabuki, and my lowe- cornell mopines.  they are also great for travel too.  i used to roll my brushes up in a towel and secure with a rubber band, but with the brush guard, i can pack them in a pencil pouch with no worries."
4613,1,"Beautiful color with nice summery pop!_Love the whole Shellac experience! It is unbelievable how beautiful my nails look and the fact that the manicure lasts for 2 weeks is absolutely supreme. I have one less thing to stress about, chipped nails be gone!  This color is bright and summery.  I have really enjoyed all the compliments I have gotten on my fingernails and toenails!"
3004,1,"It stays on!_Bought this for a tear jerking show. Read the reviews saying it was very hard to get off. My dog died earlier in the day, and I can tell you, if you cry enough it will come off but will not leave you with raccoon eyes. I would say it does the job and does it well."
8496,1,There Is Truth In Advertising_My son is using this to style his hair and keep it in place and he likes it. Since it is a cream it is gentle enough to use as a styling aid but doesn't give him that glued down helmet head look. It also does not have a sticky residue. For someone who is battling dandruff this cream is really good because there is absolutely no flaking yet it keeps everything in place.My son rates this as a four star product because it works and no false claims have been made. It does exactly what the manufacturer claims it will do.
4090,1,"curls galore_I've had this product for about a week and I'm in love! This makes my curls shiny, bouncy and clump nicely. It smells delicious and I will forever repurchase this product! This is what my hair needed. I use this and top of my curls with just a lil bit of mop top anti frizz gel and I'm good to go! Lovely frizz free, bouncy curls. :-) btw I have long hair to my lower back and 3a/3b curls. So glad my husband talked me into ordering this, I was hesitant and he said 'just get it' so I did! Lol"
8846,1,so pretty_this is so pretty. I thought it was small but it's big. It was in good condition when I received this. I really love this hair pin. Thank you very much :)
9995,1,"Loving this phytoceramides supplement! Great for my skin!_Awesome phytoceramides supplement for your skin! Makes you feel younger, softer, smoother skin in just a matter of weeks! Really loving this supplement! Can't get enough of it! Great product for sure!!"
4719,1,"Good_Seems to moisturize, smells good, cleans fine.  Good price.  No complaints.  The smell is not overwhelming, it doesn't smell very strong so if you like something like Axe this isn't for you."
5920,1,"Nice Product for deep conditioning_I was looking to see if there was anything better than All Soft by Redken.  I tried this and it is very good and did make my hair feel wonderfully conditioned but as an older person, I have the need for something a little heavier.  I think the all soft is better for us older folk with drier hair but if you are younger and don't need a really heavy conditioner than this product is probably the right one."
3143,1,"I'm in love!_After my big chop I was searching for appropriate styling tools that wouldn't damage my hair. This Denman brush is remarkable and  it detangles my kinky, coily, 4b/c hair with no breakage - only the usual shedding."
3746,1,"Great concept_I bought this in the Healthy Glow shade because the pinks really seemed to pop on my tan skin.  I just love the fact that you can really customize your look with each color.  The darker colors help contour your face and give you a more dramatic look while the medium shades go perfectly on the apples of your cheeks for a rosy glow.  The highlighter is a little too light for my skin tone and can come off really white looking if you don't tap the brush off first before applying.  The highlighter goes great under the brows to really make your eyes pop.  Overall, it is a really great concept and the colors can be used together or seperate and they all have a really great shimmer to them."
2998,1,Great eyebrow pencil_This is the best eyebrow pencil ever. It always stays sharp and you can draw little hairs for a more natural look. I can't find it in the stores anymore and so glad Amazon has it!
1399,1,"Facial Enzyme Mask_I think this a pretty good product. My face definitely feels smoother after I use it. I'm always looking for new exfoliators and I usually use ones with a mechanical action (ie: sugar scrubs) but this worked nicely too. I tried following it up with their goji berry hydrating mask but that was a terrible idea, it burned so much I had to wash it right off. I recommend letting your skin rest a bit before putting anything on after using this!"
6344,1,"Great quality for the money_I bought this for a playboy bunny halloween costume (full disclosure, I am a man). It looked great. Very natural, and much better quality than I expected for the money. I would highly recommend."
5515,1,"Better than Shimmer Lights_I used this many times and it does work to remove brassiness. Not a lot of stores around my area sell it but it does work much better than Shimmer Lights. Because it is a subtle, gradual change I only gave it 4 stars, I don't think anything can beat Schwarzkopf's Silver Shampoo! But, as a substitute if you can get this it works. Of course, you have to use the conditioner also for best results and it leaves your hair healthy looking and shiny.Def recommended  :)"
3486,0,"Difficult to work with_This product is one of ELF's higher raved about items and generally well-recommended among brow products in general so I figured I would give it a shot. I found it was extremely unforgiving, the brush is much too short to get a good grip on so thankfully I have a full size brow brush I used instead. But even so, the powder was so densely packed that it took multiple swipes to even get any product on the brush, and applied streaky onto my brows. The wax was even worse, it was almost like it was mostly dried out and it made my brush harden with the gunk. I wanted to like this because it is so affordable but it just didn't work for me."
3540,1,"Works well as long as you use it carefully_Like many other reviewers, my reasoning for purchasing this product is because I have keratosis pilaris on my arms. I tend to just live with it most of the time, but if I have a special occasion coming up then I will use this (and the lotion) religiously. I was gearing up for my wedding, so of course I used this! It works well as long as you use it regularly, but be careful! It is not for those with sensitive skin and I have burned myself with this stuff on more than one occasion. It works well for acne also, so I would occasionally use it on my chest or back, but that skin is significantly more sensitive than my arms so I would tend to burn myself if I used too much/too often.As long as you're careful, this stuff will work wonders. KP is a pain in the behind, but Glytone definitely helps manage it."
7583,1,brshes_nice brushes different colora and aizws got at a good prce so that lakes me happy ajd seems to work qell.the brushees when i tryed thwm
2586,1,Works!!_Used this lotion twice and already see a difference...doesn't have bronzer in it so i know its actually me getting tan and not &#34;stained&#34;.  Love it!!
8822,1,"Good stuff_This eye cream is pretty good.  I like the constancy, smell (much more coffee then vanilla that other customers reported) and absorbency.  I haven't seen a massive change in my under eyes, but will continue to use it."
3656,1,"Not All Exfoliating Cloths Are Made Equal!!!_I was on the fence about trying out this cloth.  I had been using a different one (the Earth Therapeutics Exfoliating Hydro Cloth) for a while, it was a bit cheaper and was getting the job done just fine.  However, I'd been hearing all these great things about the various brands of Japanese exfoliating cloths and how they are the best cloths you can get...so I said why not, and splurged on this particular cloth (I wanted the super hard weave, I guess I'm a bit of a masochist).  Let me tell you, this thing is AMAZING.  My original attitude was 'come on, how much better or different can one cloth be from another?!'  VERY different and WAY better!  First of all, this cloth is huge, which I love.  You will have absolutely no problem reaching any part of your body with this thing, I don't even have to open it all the way to wash my back with it.  You only need a small amount of cleanser to get a ton of lather and the cloth rinses clean very easily and it also dries quickly, so you don't have to worry about mold/bacteria infesting it.  I love the super hard weave as well- you don't need to use a crazy amount of elbow grease and you'll still get great, invigorating exfoliation.  And don't let the name deter you either- my skin tends to be on the dry sensitive side but I've used this cloth several times already and haven't had any issues with redness or irritation from the super hard weave.  My skin has never been softer, smoother, or more glowy and healthy looking from any other exfoliating product I've used.  I'm hooked for life, this thing is totally worth the cost and I wholeheartedly recommend it!  X-D"
64,1,great product_I have thick hair and it works great. Makes hair soft and shiny.  If you use too much it will make your hair look flat.
2108,1,Lovely_Wonderful fragrance.  Very subtle and not to overwhelming so you can spray on more if needed and not freak out other people.
9184,1,Help me a ton_Brought this item for myself because i have alot of scar and mark on my legs and face. I used and it work for me within a week. It helps clear away most of my marks and scar leaving. Highly recommend to buy
2045,1,"Works Great_We saw this at a hospital where my mom was at, we tried it and my older sister said this is good stuff. So I checked Amazon where I usually buy all my stuff and sure enough they had it. We will be ordering again soon. Thanks"
7919,1,Love them_This item was worth the money. It is a great buy at a great price. It has several different colored stones in it and it's plenty of each color except for black.
2644,1,Fantastic!_Great quality and perfect magnification. Mounted easily to the wall and matches my bathroom accessories. The only thing that would make it better is if it cleaned itself :)
6833,1,"My hair says YEEEESSSS_this thing is great it does not weight my hair down. I don't like blow drying my hair after I wash it but that leaves it to become a frizzy ugly mess.. but using this oil I just have to put it on my damp hair and go out and about and when my hair is dry it is silky soft, not frizzy at all and looking good (i have natural wavy hair).. I do have long hair so I use a little more than a pea size drop.. more like a penny sized drop :P so I wish the bottle was bigger because it is so tiny! but I mean 3.3 oz makes it great for traveling lol the smell is delicious while its in the bottle... i cant really smell it on my hair which might be good for people who don't like smells.. i like smelling life fruits and flowers lol"
9033,1,"Looks promising_After only too weeks of use, I'm very satisfied with the results I've seen so far.  At my age, I can't expect miracles, but this cream is giving me confidence that they will be a noticeable improvement."
194,1,"Keeps my skin feeling soft and moisturized_This is one of the few moisturizing products that I've actually ordered a second time.  Usually I use a bottle or part of one, get tired of it because it doesn't work as expected, and move on to another product.  This regenerating serum just works.  It makes my skin feel hydrated and soft without a greasy or heavy feel.  It absorbs quickly and is perfect under foundation or withOlay Definity Color Recapture, Light/Medium, 1.7-Ounce Box.  It's also nice because it goes a long way.  Just two pushes of the pump, a couple of drops, is enough to moisturize my whole face.  So the bottle lasts a long time.The only thing I didn't like as much about this serum is that I mistakenly ordered this one that has a light fragrance.  It's not overpowering or anything and it dissipates quickly, but I really prefer the fragrance free version.Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Concentrated Amino-Peptide Complex, Fragrance Free - 1.7 fl ozI'm not sure if it makes me look younger but it does seem to minimize the appearance of wrinkles.  It makes my skin feel good."
9796,1,"Healthier skin naturally_Unlike other skin serums, Vitamin C serum is a natural way to produce collagen because of it's ascorbic acid. Collagen will increase your skins elasticity making it tighter, firmer and more plump - which means less of that sagging feeling. It is rich in anti-oxidants that repairs and revives the cells and give the skin a healthier younger appearance. It makes my skin have brighter glow and feel velvety soft. Did I mention you can see results after using the serum one week!The serum has a very watery texture but glides on like silk. It has a citrus aroma and absorbs very quickly into your skin. I use it all over my face and throat in the AM and PM. It can be used alone or underneath a moisturizer.Besides helping give your face a younger healthier new look, Vitamin C serum also helps your skin repair itself from damage such as scars, age or dark spots, sun damage and even expedite the healing of wounds and reduce inflammation.However, be advised that it does have a shelf life. Vitamin C serum should be clear and not yellowish. If it smells rancid or weird, it should also be thrown away. This means it has oxidized and has lost its effectiveness. A good Vitamin C Serum is sold in an amber bottle just like this one to extend its shelf life. Make sure to store it away from heat and sunlight and that the cap is tightly closed. If you like you can even store it in the refrigerator.Sample provided for review."
5765,1,"Excellent brush_This brush is great, it does not shed and it washes well. This brush performs exceptionally well in comparison with other name brands for a fraction of the price.  I use this to apply cream blush and it's applies perfectly.  I love it!"
8507,1,"An Improvement on my Usual Shampoo_I have been using Head and Shoulders for years, occasionally switching to Tgel or Selson Blue, to switch out the pyrithione zinc for other active ingredients from time to time.  When I got a chance to get a reviewer bottle of this shampoo I was pretty happy.  And I have been even happier since I've been using it for a little while.I have no idea what the Caffeine does for my hair, but I do need the pyrithione zinc.  But whatever else goes into this shampoo has left my hair softer and lighter feeling than H&S; ever has.  The smell is pleasant although I can no longer after my hair is dry.  This is more than I can say for TGel which is not my favorite smell. and it seems to stick with me all day.I was hoping to find a cheaper dandruff shampoo and this is not cheaper, but it is close to the price of other anti dandruff shampoos, however none of the others has left my hair feeling this good. After about a week of using this, I can say that I would recommend it.  For now, this is going to be on my shopping list."
4400,1,Amazing Product!_I swear this stuff makes my hair fuller and thicker and it grows much faster with it. I've not even used a heating cap as it says to do &#8212; I only use it as a conditioner in the shower and leave it in for a few minutes. This bottle has lasted a good amount of time and I highly recommend it to promote healthy hair as well as growth.
7498,1,"I love the smell of this!_I suppose I am biased, I love the smell of coconut and bought this because of that. But recently I got these soap dispensers that use 75% less soap and added this into them...now I'm truly in heaven, great smelling soap and will last forever...ha!"
4287,1,"Good for...everything!_I really really love this conditioner. I have coarse 4b/4c hair and have a hard time keeping it moisturized. I discovered this hair care line after reading a natural hair care book. And, I am so grateful I found it. This conditioner is pretty thick and has all natural ingredients. There are no parabens, no silicones, and plenty of natural oils to help nurse hair back to health or maintain a healthy hair care regimen.I have started using it as a leave-in and a styling agent. My hair loves it! I would definitely recommend it for those who want to lose the chemicals, get back to basics, and purchase high quality items.In terms of getting a deal, I would recommend keeping an eye on sales at Walgreen's and Target. They often have buy one, get one free deals. This price is a joke. Target always has this product for $10 or less."
3514,1,"excellent_This product is superior as far as cleansing,I don't like to use cleansers,they are usually greasy but this product is not at all.The smooth side is a good cleanser,the rough side is great for exfoliating."
5326,1,"Not sure if I have the same stuff!_Maybe my Suave volumizing mousse has a different formula, but I have no complaints about the smell or the texture of my hair after I use it - other than I need to brush or comb it through once my hair has dried or my hair is stiff.  This mousse is the best solution for my half-straight and half-wavy layered hair.  I simply put in on when my hair is wet and I am done with styling.  I can hardly detect any odor to the product.This is the difference for me between a bad and good hair day."
6767,1,"Easy to use.._Nice tape, easy to start.. pretty colors.. sticks good.. little advice, when you're done using it, fold down the end of the tape so you have a starting point for the next time.  :)"
2047,1,"Dries without being sticky_I bought this to take on a tropical vacation and it was wonderful. We were visiting a humid country, but this gel dries well and is absorbed into the skin without feeling sticky, so it was very comfortable. It has no extra fragrance or unnecessary chemicals. I would buy it again."
8520,1,"Great 2-in-1_Dove Men+Care Sensitive Scalp Fortifying 2 in 1 Shampoo and conditioner is a great option for guys who want to save time but not at the expensive or ruining their hair. It's a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner in one that is suitable for a dry, itchy scalp. It also works on all hair types and is Enriched with caffeine and tea tree extract to gently cleanse the scalp while conditioning hair.My husband recently switched to this after using the Dove Fortifying shampoo by itself and he's really pleased. The Dove shampoo helps Strengthens and thickens hair leaving it feeling healthy and soft.So if your guy has a sensitive scalp, or just wants a great 2+1 try this and you'll be glad you did."
8616,1,"Wife loves it_My wife is pretty careful about what she puts in her hair. But she also doesn't like to spend a lot of money on hair products. So this was a thrill for her to try. She loves this stuff, but the price is a bit steep. Her hair comes out soft and smooth, even with a different brand of shampoo. I don't think she'll be buying this stuff regularly, but once in a while it's probably worth the expense."
4265,1,"...Like a canvas!_I rarely wear makeup.  I love it but just don't ever take the time to do it right.  Anyhow, I bought this because I have a cruise coming up and want to 'paint my face' every day.  I tried this for the first time and my friends noticed right away.  I loved how it made my face look like a canvas, ready for painting!  My tone is usually all off and this stuff looked absolutely incredible.  My friends stated that they thought it made them look older because of their wrinkles and lines but on me (I am tan with oily skin) it looked great!  You really just have to try it."
9873,1,"Hot and does the job_I have wanted a hot brush for a while. I first tried the blowdryer/brush combo but that didn't work well because the brush wasn't round. This is great, it gives the heat and smoothness of a flat iron but provides body and style instead of flat and fried. I love it. My hair is just below shoulder length, very thick and very curly and it helps with touch ups or smoothing after a blow dry."
9423,0,"No results_I've used and enjoyed John Frieda products to preserve and brighten hair color before.  I was quite excited by this product, since I figured it was replacing the sadly discontinued glaze for red hair.  However, the results are disappointing.  Namely, I noticed zero change in color (except for a few spots on my arms where I accidentally dripped the gloss.)  My hair looked perhaps a little glossier.  It didn't, however, damage my hair or my bathroom.  It does appear to have worked for other people, but it was a big disappointment to me."
9309,1,"Absolutely amazing!_I have used serums in the past but this is the first one I have tried with Vitamin C. Let me tell you, I notice a huge difference! My skin looks like it did when I was a teenager and I am loving it! If you have yet to try one with Vitamin C I would highly recommend Triple Action Vitamin C Serum. It is extremely high quality and will have me coming back for more many years to come."
6190,1,"Five Stars_They are okay ,3 of the same colors"
3894,1,"Best Cleanser I have found_Best Cleanser I have found to go with my Clarisonic system. It removes all traces of makeup and grime without drying out my skin. All the First Aid Beauty products I have  ever tried are good, and this one is no exception. It also rinses easily, which is a great plus in my opinion because when cleansers do not rinse completely, they tend to leave a muddy layer that inhibits that radiant appeal we all strive for.I recommend this for anyone who wants a gentle cleanser that does its job leaving your face ready to better absorb whatever treatment product you use."
9963,1,"LOVE THIS!_My sons both had a dry scalp. Once I reveived this, I made sure they used it on their head. They no longer have a dry scalp and the little red bumps one had are gone! I love this stuff! I will order again as needed for y sons and myself!"
9226,1,"SILKY SMOOTH HAIR!!!_This stuff works great!! You just need a little bit!! I spray once on my left side, once on my left and once in the back and brush it through, when I'm done blow drying my hair, I have no more frizz or static in my hair!! It's sooooo soft!!! I have oily hair, that's why I use just a tiny bit, I can see if I were to use more then a tiny bit, it would look greasy. I love touching my hair! Running my fingers through it!! Baby soft!! I would think if you have real dry hair you would put a little more on then me, but still you don't need much, this bottle should last me a long time, plus it wash my hair every 4 days. Hope my review helped :) have a great day!!"
7247,1,"Fast delivery and authentic product_This is one of my favorite face soaps for keeping my skin bright, oil free and pimple free. I think this may be my third order of a multi pack of Kojie San but my first with this particular vendor. I actually like their 4 pack and price because I've typically have only gotten the 3 pack bundles from others. Excellent seller. I'll stick with them for future purchases of this brand."
4439,1,"Refreshing Pine Scent_The amazing pine scent is what sold me on this product when I first smelled it in the store. The bottle is huge, so it lasts a long time. The body wash is moisturizing, refreshing and leaves my sensitive skin soft and smooth. Since I try to avoid body washes with chemical ingredients or perfumes, I like that this one has no sulfates, phthalates, artificial fragrances or animal testing. When I use it, the pine and ginseng scent isn't as strong as when I smelled it in the bottle, but it's still a nice, natural, aromatherapy wash for the bath or shower."
2469,1,"Powder_After trying out this powder multiple times, I've come to realize that I don't need it. Haha life is silly that way. I suppose it does what it's intended to - a very lightweight translucent powder."
224,0,"Breakout City_Sulfates!  This product broke me out with cystic acne on my forehead, chin, and nose.  Also, it's very drying and I have super oily skin - like wash face at 8am and tiny beads of oil on my nose by 9am.  So disappointed by the product."
2164,1,"Helpful!_I'm an adult and I bought this since my hair gets tangled at the nape of my neck after sleeping. I put a very small amount there before bed and it makes it much easier to come through in the morning. It's not a super miracle, but it definitely helps. Don't use too much though as I've noticed using it consecutive days or too much at a time causes some major build up."
4119,1,Great_It really does help my eyeshadow stay on longer. I have sensitive skin and this did not break me out at all. It is small but really even if you wear eye shadow daily it should last you a long time.
4624,1,"Worked for Thickness, Not So Much For Length_I used this just as directed for about 5 weeks and a few days. I did feel that it made my lashes somewhat thicker but what I was hoping for was more length and unfortunately, that didn't happen for me.There are a couple of things I want to mention: I'm in my 40's and I have peri-menopause. While using this product I got some eye inflamation. However, my dermatologist said it was allergies and even after mentioning this product he said he felt it was more due to the allergies. I had to stop using the product for a few days and when I resumed using it, it does sometimes irritate but it's more like when you get a bit of soap in your eye. I was able to finish the rest of the recommended course without another bout of the inflammation I had with the allergies.I mention the periomenopause because it can have an affect on how your hair grows. I literally used to have eyelashes so long they brushed the bottom of my eyebrows but since my doc diagnosed the perimenopause, they've gradually shortened. This may be why this product didn't work as well for me as for some others. Also, taking a break from it for about 4-5 days also could have been a factor.Should my eyelashes ever thin, I would absolutely consider buying this product to help with that but I'm happy with the thickness of my lashes so for now I'm going to leave well enough alone. I do think that if you aren't going through perimenopause or menopause then this would be worth giving a try. I think this is just one of those products that you have to try to see if it'll work for you."
4593,1,like it_this makes my hair feel very soft...love it...will def order again in the future. would recommend this product for all hair types.
5843,1,Always grows my Nails_This is a repeat purchase and review.  This item really works and is less expensive than many products I've tried.
1922,1,"For Black/African/Ethnic hair - works great!_After reading the reviews on this product, I'm wondering if the people trying it out were aware that the target audience for this product is African/black and/or ethnic hair.  If you don't have any experience with black hair, you might not realize that it can be very dry & brittle & needs a heavy, moisturizing conditioner which is what this is.My daughter is bi-racial and has super kinky, thick Type 4C hair.  We have a terrible time keeping it moisturized and are always looking for a good product for her.  My other daughter, also bi-racial, has a looser curl, more of a 3C or 4A type.  This conditioner works WONDERS on both types of hair.  It does leave a nice coating on the shaft of the hair which gives it a healthier look.  It feels healthier and is easier to style.We have one of those old fashioned 60's style bonnet hair dryers so with my kinkier haired daughter, I put the conditioner on and sat her under it for 10 minutes on low heat.  It took her extremely dry and tightly curled hair and turned it into slightly looser curls and very moisturized hair.  She was so excited because the looser curls made her hair look longer.  Now she's more than willing to sit under the dryer for 10 minutes since it makes her hair grow really fast ;)I am a very fair skinned redhead but with thick, curly hair so I decided to try it myself since my hair is so full of static due to the very cold weather and dry air.  It gave my hair a nice moisturized healthy feeling and no static.  Even though my hair has a lot of body, it tends to look poofy or frizzy if I don't flat iron it, but that brings on the static.  But after using this, my hair just looked thick & shiny - beautiful!The only thing I don't care for is the smell - it's not that it's a BAD scent, it's just not one that I like.  But I'm really picky about shampoos/conditioner & other hair products, so it might just be me.We'll definitely be buying this and other products by this brand in the future."
4772,1,"Remington S9500 Ceramic Hair straightener_today was the first time I use this product and must say that I was very impressed(and I'm not easily impress) so you can imagine I only needed to slide/glide my coarse hair only once and was finished in record time...after using it, cleaning was a breeze with a paper towel ...this is the first time I've been so excited about a ceramic straghtener...go figure"
3714,1,"Great even for Fine Hair_I've had this product for a couple of years.  It never lets me down.  I have fine hair, a bit curly and I wear in an ear length 'bob'. This width does the job to turn my hair under, it never burns me or my hair. I am buying another one even though this one still works perfectly I'm just wanting to make sure I have another to hand just in case. I have just thrown out another so-called professional flat iron that got too hot and gave me a few little burns even though I am extra careful.This model has a swivel cord and the plates have never burned my hair off even at a high temp."
9979,1,"Love!_I've become a big fan of Adovia products. This soap bar is another great addition to their line of products. I love this soap bar! It is a solid smooth bar that is a decent size and has lasted me for over a week now. It doesn't leave any weird film or residue on my skin. It actually moistures my skin and makes it feel so smooth! It makes me feel clean after without drying out my skin. It does have a very light nice scent to it that is not overwhelming in any way. It lathers well.  On top of all of that, it's infused with 100% dead sea salts which benefits your skin. Makes me feel so luxurious using it. I would highly recommend!"
3088,1,"French manis, ya!_I've never used a french manicure brush before, so maybe there are better ones out there, but for the price can you REALLY complain?!? My french manicures turned out great, and I'm horrible at doing nails."
7377,1,"Very useful._After using a stippling brush for foundation application for as long as I can remember, it is interesting to make a change to something like the Expert Face Brush. This is a small headed, densely packed, fine bristled brush which leaves you with an airbrushed finish. It took a little bit of practice with blending but other than that this brush is perfect for everyday use."
8420,1,Made hair manageable..._My hair tends to get real frizzy and unmanageable in the spring and summer months due to the weather changes.  First thing I always check is the smell-which this had a nice smell to it. Also liked the design of the bottle. Makes it easy to find in the store by its unique design and color of the bottle.Made my hair feel fresh and alive afterward and for several hours after my shower.Would buy in the future!
5665,1,"Really good dotters_Made some cute designs with them so far. There do seem to be repeated ends so 5 is probably more than necessary but it's not really a big deal. I lose things all the time so that may just benefit me later. The one thing is that on one of the tools the dotter wasn't fully secured in the base so it came right out, but some super glue will fix that I'm sure."
8230,1,"i like the product_the product is what I wanted.very powerful so do like very much,and I would recommend to my friends"
6705,1,"The best._Came across this, and it's so wonderful to use and does the job correctly in a in-home nail salon! I bought this and never had any need to want to go to the Real nail salon."
3875,1,"My grandma raves_I don't know what is particularly special about these, but they're interesting.I remember seeing a bunch of these in Hawaii, and a long time ago, my grandma was raving about them and gave me one. She used it as an adult, I used it like twice as a five-year-old. I guess I have that memory in my mind so I feel like this lipstick is for little kids, but there's a plenty number of adults using it."
7135,1,"Targeted for Afro American hair...worked for me too..._I have recently learned that the targeted hair for this product is primarily African/American with differing curl attributes.My hair is fine, medium thickness and highlighted.I have fine, medium thick, straight, highlighted hair, but it still worked for me.Motions Naturally You is a moisturizing cleanser.  Instructions are to use this product weekly.  There is no mention of an added conditioning product.I generally wash my hair each day with varying quality products...some are pricey and some not.  Since I so frequently was my hair, I never repeat the process, i.e. wash and rinse twice.Following tube directions: I washed my hair with 'Motions Naturally You' using a small amount or product, rinsed; and then I repeated the action.  The second time I washed and rinsed my hair, the product lathered more.  It did not lather on first wash for the most part.  The scent was clean, light and mild.Mostly towel and air dried, then used blower a bit before styling.  Hair is flexible, has body and styled nicely.I will repeat this 'weekly' moisturizing cleanser as directed and will update if there are any negative results.For now, I am quite pleased!BTW, I have recently learned that the targeted hair for this product is primarily African/American with differing curl attributes."
6737,1,"Works great, as described_These are fine.  I bought them for my wife to practice her designs.  She has yet to use anything I bought her regarding her nails but I can not see anything wrong with these.  Good quality and sticky pads on the bottom works fine."
6791,1,"Mangroomer it is!!_I think they are calling it a Mangroomer since it looks really cool. The grip is nice and feels solid to hold. The hairdryer itself does the job well and dries the hair fast. It has various heat, speed settings, a cool air button. I loved the power on this and it isn't too loud at the same time. You can also use the attachment but for me it worked well without it as well. The red and black combo really looks nice. I do recommend this hairdryer for the price and the power it delivers!"
6244,0,it's not long lasting at all_I just got my lipstick in the mail and I like the color but it's not a 4 hr lasting lipstick nor does it goes on matte; the lipstick came right off after eating; I was searching for a long lasting matte lipstick and this one does not make the cut so I probably want order this particular brand again.
8706,1,"Why pay more!_This is the perfect brush for concealer under eye, blending highlighters , cream blushes etc. Perfect size, and just as soft and nice as others double their price. I have to say I'm a MAC and SIgma brush girl, but this one is in my top 10 brushes"
5258,1,"GOOD PRODUCT!_I started using this product at about the same time I began a new skin care regiment; so it's not exactly an accurate test.I am feeling better about the way my face is looking, though, and I'm going to continue using both products, as maybe it synergistic in its effect.It just makes good sense..."

I use the flat iron to straighten bangs and also for a little lift at the roots on top.I love this little thing and used it every day.  It heats quickly and I'm on my way.I might experiment and give myself a spikey do just for fun"
3508,1,"Good, if you can get it out of the bottle_I just purchased this soap in an effort to use more natural products. I'm not super picky about soaps (and don't really have allergies), so as long as it smells good and doesn't irritate my skin, I'm happy. This soap doesn't do either of those things, but it is RIDICULOUS to get out of the bottle. The first time I used it I spent 5 minutes looking at it to make sure I had it open all the way. I'm not sure if it's an effort to show you how little soap you need, or what, but you can only get a tiny drip out at a time. I probably won't buy again just for that reason - I'll probably rebuy this brand, just a different bottle."
3901,1,"Another Great Palette from SHANY - The Perfect Smoky Eye_SHANY is known for being a bargain makeup company with great deals on lot assortments of product, and their strongest products are definitely their eyeshadow palettes.  The Natural Fusion palette is a perfect basic for people who like to do a smoky eye, both the traditional black/gray or variations with a touch of color, as well as creating bronze/copper looks with shades of plum and wine.  This palette isn't as versatile as some of their others, but it was made more for a couple specific types of looks rather than experimenting with a wide variety of vivid shades.  If you've wanted to try out a SHANY palette but have been putting it off because you were afraid you wouldn't use their rainbow of shades, this is definitely a good starting palette for you as their are enough neutrals to create softer daytime looks and a few darker, richer colors to spice it up for nighttime looks.Their shadows are pressed powder, but have a creamy texture when you're applying them that is never chalky and helps them stay in place.  I still recommend using a base (like the NYX white base) and probably a primer to keep them from creasing or flaking and to make the colors more vivid, but this is definitely a great value for the money."
7213,0,"If you are looking a pure, natural oil for your hair, don't buy this_I should have read the ingredients list more closely before purchasing. I thought I was buying an actual natural hair oil, but the first 3 ingredients in this are silicones. :( If you are looking a pure, natural blend of oils for your hair, don't buy this."
3409,1,"Sheer & Effective_I had the pleasure to try both editions of Vaseline Sheer Infusion (the other being Vitamin Burst).Formerly, I steered clear of sheer lotions.  They never felt quite moisturizing and I liked the way the heavier lotions felt on my skin.Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion is quite pleasant, though.  It's sheer but feels ultra-moisturizing at the same time.  The Mineral Renewal edition seems to have less of a scent than the Vitamin Burst which may be a plus for some consumers..4 stars because this lotion contains parabens and from what I have read those are not so great for you and many lotions are now available paraben-free."
3425,1,love it_have ordered several timesthis soap is now an everyday essential forthe whole familybeen using it religiously for over a year nowpackage good ship good product great
7641,1,love them_i had never seen or tried these but i recently bought them and i loved them. They are easy to use.. they don't really last long on your nail but they are great if you like to change your nail decorations often. to make them last a little longer don't forget to use your base coat.. i loved the variety of color that came with this and specially the price of this product.
1572,1,"Childhood Memories_I love the Cherry-Almond scent of this lotion.  It takes me right back to being eight years old, playing with Mommy's powders and lotions.  Oh, it is a good moisturizer, too - thick and generous but never greasy feeling."
6197,1,"Awesome!_After trying over a hundred products for dry parched hair, finally one that works! Leaves hair silky soft & shiny after blow dryer & iron!"
9876,1,"Really Nice Moisturizer_This is a really great moisturizer.  It comes in a nice size pump bottle and looks very attractive.  The moisturizer goes on very light for easy coverage of the skin.  I am very happy with the results of this moisturizer.  I saw a major difference in my skin with the first application.  I noticed fine lines and the puffiness under my eyes have lessened.  It is also made in the USA, which is a bonus.  I highly recommend this product."
3124,1,"Bought one for myself, then for a friend!_I love the way this file shapes my nail tips without shredding or snagging them.  Other &#34;sandpaper&#34; files really do a number on my soft, weak nails, but I have no such worries or headaches with this one!  I liked it so much that I bought one for my daughter-in-law, as well as the &#34;mini&#34; version for my purse!  Be sure to use the case to protect the glass/crystal file; if you just throw the file in the bottom of your purse, it may break (as glass/crystal will!)"
9954,1,Love the scent!_I was lucky enough to receive this to review and love it! I have puffy eyes with dark circles a lot because I have problems sleeping and this took care of both of those problems! And it smells so fresh!
7202,1,Decent_I am happier with the shampoo than I am with the conditioner..  The conditioner is a litle weak in comparison to the hair mask
109,1,"Great product!_This product is perfect after shaving, it leaves the skin very soft and hydrated all day long. I really enjoy it."
8546,1,"Makes hair soft_I'm not so sure that this Nexxus blow dry spray actually gives my hair lift and volume.  It does, however, make my hair really soft.  I normally wear my hair straight and don't like the feeling that most mousse or gels leave, so this spray works perfectly for me.  It is a 4 star product for me, but somebody wanting it for volume would definitely rate it lower."
7832,1,"Very happily_This product is excellent I love it ,work great and it comes nicely wrapped in own case,I recommend it ,thank you amazon."
6978,1,"Leaves my face cool, clean and soft_I may be too old for this cleanser's intended market, but I still get occasional breakouts and oiliness. I was expecting it to make my skin tight and in need of lots of moisturizer, but instead, it felt great! Only one squirt from the handy pump is needed. It lathered up and made my face tingle like Noxzema cream. It's too early to see if it will prevent zits, but so far, I like it a lot."
4239,0,"very disapponted!_Before I used Batiste dry shampoo and I love it , but because I couldnot buy this product in store but only on amazon(+ shipping) , I bought THIS brand (3 items!). O my goodness, what a mistake . My hair looked terrible , feels terrible when i touch them ,ofcouse I could not wait to come home and wash my head .And also after washing i lost hair more than usual"
1546,1,"this stuff is amazing_I love the smell, I put it on after I tan and shower, you can actually see me getting darker after I put it on and I love the firming affect. I recommend it to anyone!-)"
9255,1,"Great deal the replacement brush heads_I got mine in the mail today.  They work the same way as the name brand ones.  I have. Ever used the deep pore version from clarsonic so I can't really compare the two, but so far I am very happy with my purchase"
648,1,"Natural tan...even on pale skin!_I like that it doesn't leave white spots when it wears off.  I normally apply it 3 times within a 2 hour period and I'm able to get a really nice even tan that lasts nearly 2 weeks. As with most self-tanning gels, you need to rub it in really well or you'll get streaks.  You may also get red bumps if you apply it immediately after shaving. The product is sticky and smells like self-tanner so I would recommend you jumping in the shower before going out.  Overall, the end results are well-worth it."
5770,1,"Took a while but it grew on me!_I'll admit...I was used to the Mac Stippling brush with longer bristles.  This brush was more dense than I expected.  I used on my face and didn't start to like it until I learned how to use it properly.  First you stipple your foundation on your face...work with small sections at a time so foundation doesn't dry fast.  Then you buff foundation on your face.  I found it best to create an even base layer of foundation all over and then stipple more foundation on my problem areas.  When I use it in that way, it works best and looks great!  Nice to have in your brush collection.  My favorite brush of all time is the 'Buffing Brush' that's sold in the Core Collection.  But this brush is great when you don't have a lot of time on your hands and want to apply foundation fast and even.  I didn't like to use this with blush - powder or gel.  But foundation it's great.***UPDATE 4/4/13***After using for a while, I realize what bugs me about this brush - the bristles feel more like plasticky.  Stippling brush works great with cream to powder foundation...I use it when I want light coverage.  But the Buffing Brush is my favorite hands down!"
5165,1,"great curing light_I bought this light for my first time doing gel nails at home. It's a great curing light and it works fast, but I think an LED curing lamp would be better. I get worried about using the UV on my skin once a week or so."
8784,1,"Good for instant, but not long lasting, results._Good value. I love these eye masks. They are good to use right before events or pictures, etc."
5030,1,Excellent!_Where have you been all my life!?  I adore this product because it works so well and feels so awesome on my face and neck.  It really works to clean your face and I will use it always.  Worth the buy and a must have for any woman.
7124,0,not good_red the reviews and ordered this.  much to my dismay the pull day was a year old and had no scent at all.  BUT amazon saved the day and gave me a refund.  i love amazon customer service.  back to this product it seem to work ok but no scent at all
5221,1,Works great!!!_Goes on easy and stays on.  Is a great product and I would highly recommend it.  It has a nice shine to it also and looks more natural.  Good to use with a color too and then your nails don't get the color embed into your nail.
3888,1,"Exactly what I was expecting._I purchase Clove Oil and like to use it as perfume. I am fond of the company who makes it, Edens Garden and their products are quality.This oil is exactly what I was expecting and I recommend it."
6630,1,"Nice product, but it sure is expensive._Presentation:This kit presents well in a heavy, high quality box.  The products themselves are tubes contained in a dark mirror finish (almost like hematite) plastic case. The amounts in each tube are tiny (most are 3 tsp or less).Use of Product:I have oily skin and it's quite sensitive, so I wasn't sure about trying a new product like this.  However, I really liked the cleanser and scrub.Facial Exfoliator: An ivory/peachy colored cream that looks like satiny ribbons.  I used about the size of a large pea and that was plenty.  It makes a really luxurious low-bubble lather that left my face feeling exceptionally smooth and clean.Facial Cleanser: This is a fantastic product.  It is a strange color/texture though.  It looked like I was squeezing a snail out onto my fingers - dark grayish/purple color and it had an almost mousse-like viscosity.  A little bit goes a LONG way with this.  Barely using half a pea size would wash my face, neck and almost onto my shoulders.Lotions/serums:  I did not note anything remarkably different than competing products, other than that they were mild enough for my exceptionally sensitive skin.  No breakouts either.The smell was OK, not bad or great.I like the cleansers in this kit a lot, but the price of the product overall is really quite high for the market it's in."
2769,1,Good for body but not for face_The cream moisturizes very well. In winter I used it and only needed to put the cream on every three to four days.Unfortunately it caused red clogged pores on my face. So I don't reccomend it for the face. But it's great for the rest of the body.
3076,0,Not Straight_I was excited to try this flat iron after reading all the reviews.  It didn't straighten my hair to my expectations and made my hair feel like straw.  I guess I will be going back to the hot comb.  I also used it on my daughter's hair (finer than my hair) which didn't straighten her hair well and made it feel coarse.
3354,1,"Love It ! !_Great perfume. Everything was packaged properly and it smells SO GOOD. I absolutely love it. This is eligible for Free Super Saver Shipping, & I clicked that option. That's approximately 5-8 days. I purchased this item on April 10th, and I received it on April 13th. You do the math. Overall its a great product and its a great price. Couldn't ask for anything better."
9969,1,So refreshing!_This serum had an immediate cooling sensation and left my skin feeling calmed and refreshed! I am looking forward to seeing the long term effects!
1246,1,"Thick product, smells great, feels good on winter skin_I use this product every day during the winter.  I order it through the subscribe and save program.  I put layer it on my feet and elbows nightly and then rub it in my palms with a little unscented lotion or water to thin it for the rest of my body.  The scent is light and lingers, but not over whelming.  A good product."
6598,1,"GREAT!_I bought these a few months back and I love them! They work very well and the case it comes in is very nice to have, it keeps everything organized!"
6488,1,"Sometimes Simple is Best_I love this line of products. I have not yet found a Simple product that I have not loved. Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel is exactly what it says. It is simple, not full of fru-fru nonsense you don't need. It is refreshing, leaving your face feeling cool and clean. It does not strip your skin of all moisture. It did not leave me with that uncomfortable 'tight' feeling I sometimes get with other over-drying facial washes. It lathers nicely, and rinses clean. Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel is just like all of this line's other products... simply awesome!"
142,1,it really works!!!_I  have discoloration on my check and it disappear slowly but surely --I will definitely add this to my subscribe listyayReena
1481,1,"Good for a base_My grandma actually bought this in Vintage Lace because she wanted something light and later decided to give it to me since she wasn't wearing much makeup anymore.  I am usually not a huge fan of matte shadows but I figured I would give it a try since it was free and would just be thrown away if I didn't use it.  I tan on a regular basis so just wearing this alone would be very frightening on me.  Through experimenting I found that this is the perfect base for my eyelids.  It goes on smoothly, blends well, and prevents my other shadow from creasing.  I am sure it would look fine on someone with a more fair complection but I think it works great as an eyeshadow base.  I would recommend it just for that fact alone.  It also works for just a touch of color on the brow bone under the brows and is more wearable for everyday since it is not shimmery or shiney for work. Can't beat the Amazon price either:)"
4893,0,"not good_I did not like this product.  It made my hair hard and brittle, did not do anything for my hair."
3793,1,"Excellent product_The shampoo should be used with the companion conditioner for ultimate results. I have used this product for over 2 years. My hair is very fine and would break easily. The shampoo and conditioner just about eliminated the breakage and shedding all over my clothes. Has a nice fresh scent, not sweet like most. Just recently had to refil product and could not find the shampoo and conditioner in stores. So I was so glad to find it at Amazon. I would recommend it."
5883,1,"If you want a natural look, give this a try_This mascara is for a more natural look.  It isn't too thick on my lashes, though I have to use a lash comb to separate my lashes, which is normal protocol.  I like the design of the bottle since I like my mascara to stand upright.  Some bottles fall over a lot.  This product also washed off rather well with soap and water.  Thanks to Vine, I never need to buy mascara again."
1488,1,"Dewy glow, no sparkly vampires here!_When you look at the compact it actually looks a little intimidating - I thought it would be way to sparkly to be used as a luminizer. I just wanted something that helped my MAC NC30 skin looked fresh and dewy and this does just the trick! After applying setting powder I use a large fluffy brush, swipe this with a light touch and then pop it onto the apples of my cheeks towards temples and brow bone and then a little bit on the bridge of my nose and it looks amazing - like pretty, fresh skin, not overly sparkly. You can also use this powder as a brow bone highlighter, on your cupids bow, and even as a very subtle eye shadow. It lasts about 8 hrs on me."
4682,1,Replaced my CHI_I cant believe the quality of this inexpensive straightener. I spent 5 times as much on my last iron.. never again.
9932,1,"Life saver!_new face primer for the new century, amazing and just when i thought i was done for here comes a product that literally saved me from sudden disaster, i lost my normal primer, honestly i couldn't find it anywhere so i decided to use this instead on my eye lids because mine are so oily. after i washed my face i added a few tiny drops of this before putting on my eye shadow and it never moved all day! What a life saver! Not oily or greasy like you would think it would be, and my skin just drinks it up like it was the only thing it has seen this good in a long long time!"
8386,1,"Great deal!_Love the dotting tools and the rhinestones are great. I like that they're not too big, so they tend to stay on very well.  Great kit for the price!"
4468,1,88colors_like wow great colors i lvoe it.. great for my side job since i do makeup and hair.  great colors and pigments.
8312,1,"Does give dull hair some shine, doesn't weigh down_For reference, I have long, baby fine, wavy hair, which tends to get dry on the ends and look dull between hair cuts. I've been using theSuave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Shampoo 28 ozand theSuave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner, 12.6 Ounceand I've been very pleased with them and the scent of them is heavenly. So, I decided to try this Shine Mask out.It works great to add a nice sheen to your hair and it won't weigh fine hair down. It seems to leave a better sheen when you follow the directions and leave in your hair for 3 minutes. When my hair is starting to look a bit dull I use this instead of my usual conditioner. I've been very impressed with Suave Professional's Moroccan Infusion line so far. I will definitely repurchase this."
3084,1,SHOWER BUDDY_My husband loves this body wash.  Said he likes the way it lathers up and makes him feel so clean....
4003,1,"Good product_I always like to try a new concealer. I ran out of my previous concealer, and I didn't want to go splurge on a holy grail product. After looking at the reviews for CG Ageless concealer, I figured I would give it a try. I would say it covers about 80-90% of the darkness under my eyes. I always set it with powder, so it lessened the amount of coverage for some reason.I would recommend to make this a 'go-to' for a cheap & easy concealer. If you are looking for a more flawless look try Coastal Scents concealer pallette."
7167,1,"This is such a great Value!_I love this scent! I prefer this scent to Katy Perry's other scent for the simple fact that this one is more sweet and less musky to me. I couldn't believe how large this bottle is for the amount paid. I just think It's a fantastic value compared to what you might pay in stores. If you love this scent, I definitely recommend buying it here. The shipment came packaged well and very fast."
2327,1,"Retains your color, keeps hair in good shape_This version of Wen Cleansing Conditioner is for hair that gets oily in summer and is the most clarifying of the varieties of Wen. But you have to use it properly. It's not a foaming shampoo. You need to make sure your hair is thoroughly wet first and then put in a handful of this product and coat all the hair thoroughly. (I comb it in with a wide tooth comb after mixing in some water to make it easier to distribute.) Then after letting it sit for five minutes, rinse under cool water. This takes a while--so be patient. If you don't use enough, it won't clean. If you don't rinse with cool water, it leaves your hair greasy, so you have to follow directions. I find that this retains the color in my hair a lot better than even color-safe shampoo.It comes out well afterwards, so you don't need a conditioner step. If your hair is thick, you can add a quarter-sized amount before combing out as a leave in conditioner. This is my favorite Wen variety along with Tea Tree. Both clean very well. The menthol is nice as you rinse out in the shower, especially in the summer."
5590,1,Awesome_Great color and of course NYX is an outstanding makeup product line.  I would recommend their products to all makeup lovers.
1016,1,"Great Moisturizer For Oily Skin_I have oily, acne-prone skin, and this is an excellent moisturizer for when I want some hydration, without the oily/greasy feeling. After cleansing, I pour a dime-sized amount into my clean palm, rub my hands together to warm it up, and then pat the product onto my skin until fully absorbed. It does feel a little bit sticky upon application, but it dries smoothly. I can use this in the morning and at night. It doesn't leave any residue behind and the skin just feels soft and plump. I have been using this for a couple of months now and it has never broken me out. A very nice hyaluronic acid moisturizer!"
2895,1,Nice Brush Set!_I love these brushes.  I was rolling the dice as you sometime's never know what you will get with inexpensive brush sets and this one was a score!  They brushes have very nice soft fibers (but not too soft) and are well made with little to no shedding.  My favorite is the eye shadow brush I use it all the time and I have washed it many times and it dries just fine.  The foundation brush is pretty nice too has a nice firmness to the bristles.  Each brush came in it's own reusable case that was nice also.  You can't go wrong with this set if you are not in the market to pay a lot of money for brushes.
4533,0,"Definitely not good on curly or thick hair, but works on already straight or flat hair._I have very thick, very long, and very wavy hair for a man, so I'm always looking for shampoos that can straighten my hair so I don't have to resort to a straightening iron. So far the best I've found is Herbal Essences 'Dangerously Straight.' However I'm always looking for something new. When I got the chance to review this shampoo and the accompanying conditioner,Pantene Pro-v Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy To Smooth Conditioner, 12.6-ounce (Pack of 6).Unfortunately, this shampoo does not hold up under fire. In fact, instead of unfrizzing my hair, it turned my head into a giant mass of snarls and knots. The hair actually curled up more and made my hair a living nightmare. The conditioner helped somewhat, but this was one of the worst shampoo experiences of my life. It was painful trying to get all the snarls out post shower.With that in mind, you're probably wondering why I didn't give this a one star. Well, my girlfriend has very straight hair and we tried it on her and it actually gave her hair body. So on two different people the shampoo did the opposite of what it was supposed to. With me, it was horrific, but with her, it actually gave her the effect she normally looks for in shampoos that are supposed to add body.So take note Pantene - rebrand who is supposed to get this shampoo, and you have a winner. For people like myself who have medium-thick hair and are looking for something to get the curls and friz out, do NOT try this or you will regret it horribly."
5911,0,"Not for me..._I picked up a tube on sale with a coupon. It sounded like the perfect product with both conditioning and gel which wavy and curly hair needs. Despite having had my hair for several decades, I feel like only in recent years with the help of such books as Curly Girl, am I starting to get a handle on how to take care if it. My hair is something on the 2a/2b spectrum; I've got spiral curls, wavy hair and some areas that are generally straight. The crown has gray (which lucky for me masquerades as blonde) and is very dry, even though I use no heat appliances and wear hats to protect it. My hair easily takes a curl but can just as easily get flat from shampooing, wind, hat-wearing, etcetera. There is a constant struggle between having enough gel/conditioner to encourage curl & keep it healthy-looking and having it get flat and greasy-looking from too much &#34;stuff&#34; in it (which tends to accumulate). I tell you all this to give you a basis of comparison for your own hair. So I tried this product and hated it. It somehow made my hair greasy-looking, crunchy AND flyaway! How it managed all that... To be fair in my cruel assessment, I used it a couple times and got the same result. Ick. I'd be better off using nothing than this gel cream. I gave it 2 stars and not just one because, as some reviews suggest, it might be fine for a different hair type."
6026,1,non-greasy very nice skin softener._This almond oil is fast absorbing and is fragrance free. Very good value for the size and I will order again.
3269,0,"You get what you pay for_Cheap, doesn't hold on, gets into fine lines,  smears easily. Would not recommend to buy.  You can find better even for the same price."
1494,1,Look no further if you are looking for a perfect sun screen!_I have been trying sun screens for the past couple of years and now I feel the search is over!Elta MD UV shield 45 is not greasy or tacky at all. It easily absorbs and leaves your skin transparent (no white cast!).  I use it before applying mineral foundation on my face and it works perfect!!
7771,1,I liked it a lot_Low cost and works fine with some added primer. Good makeup for every other day. They had tones of shades.
7433,0,"Might be good for others but NOT ME!_The first problem I had with this shampoo, was expecting to see something CLEAR poured into my hand, given the name of it. When it came out a pinkish opaque I should have known that was only the beginning. But I proceeded to use it anyway and was sorely disappointed to the point of all out frustration, perhaps anger. I have very long hair, almost to my waist, and it's always been fine/limp, so seeing that this shampoo says VOLUMIZING, I expected it to do that. Instead it went on like conditioner without having used shampoo, and ultimately it felt like I gave my hair an oil bath. I actually had so much oily residue (or whatever that was!) as a result of using this, that I had to wash my hair again with GOOD shampoo (Pantene), to get that stuff off my hair. But in the meantime, while assessing the consequences of using 'CLEAR', I found my hair to have zero body or fullness, and it was nearly impossible to get dry, or maybe it did get dry and felt so oily I couldn't tell. Either way, I absolutely hated it. I have been wondering what they were thinking, making a product like this. And as for it being opaque instead of clear, I find that odd, because every other volumizing shampoo I use (Pantene, Dove, Suave, etc) comes out clear and yet does not use that as their claim to fame.Regardless of that, I very generously gave this 2 stars because I am assuming my hair type must be at least partly to blame for my bad experience. I would hope this shampoo is useful for someone that has excessively dry or 'wiry' hair who needs the deepest conditioning to tame it or soften it."
3459,1,love it_i love the packaging of this item. it was well organized and well wrapped. the brushes were as displayed in the picture on the website.  i recommend it for all make up lovers. the primer is so good. it helps the eye shadow to last longer on the eye.
7851,1,"Nice sparkle and size._My nails are smaller than other people's so I figured out that what is good for others is not really good for me.Most nails parts are too big for me, but this one is perfect on my thumb!So shiny and nicely curved, so it sits on the nails pretty well."
7805,1,"Shiny_I have limp hair and need a lot of work in order to give it any volume.  Often, I have to put a ton of hairspray in my hair just to make it last more than an hour.Honestly, I stray from TIGI products, because as a 27 year-old, the smell of their products and fanbase seemed to be too teen for me.  I admit I'm not crazy about the smell of this hairspray, but I am really impressed by how shiny it makes my hair.  Not sure if this is normal, but it also seems to create a wave in my hair that I find really cute- like an extra bonus.On it's own, it doesn't create the 'puff' that I'm looking for, but it does hold well if enough is used.  I have found there is a really good combination between this product and my usual TRESemm&eacute; Extra Hold.This has made me curious to try other TIGI products!"
8583,1,"great product_this glue is strong and bonds really well to fake nails!!I was actually really surprised, I was going to go with super glue but I'm actually really glad I went this route instead."
2537,1,"Does what it's supposed to_I bought a semi-high quality wig and wanted to make sure it would hold it's shape so I bought this and it works. It's light (of course because it's styrofoam) and it doesn't tip, so that's a plus. I'd buy again!"
8401,1,Great price_These are so cheap and work really well. I can do so many designs easy to use I definitely recommend these So worth the cheap price.
1783,1,"Awesome company_This is the third time I have purchased from this company, they don't has as many items in amazon as they do on their website.  They are awesome and always send a great large sample size with each order that I have made.  This prep solution works great, I use it before my peel.  Highly recommended."
3138,1,"Leaves hair silky and soft!_This is an amazing shampoo! I use it with the matching conditioning masque, but even before using the conditioner, I feel the difference in my hair as I wash out the shampoo. I have thick, frizzy, wavy hair, with lots of flyaways. When I wash other shampoos out of my hair, the hair feels tangly, but when I wash this shampoo out, my hair is immediately MUCH SMOOTHER than it was before I put the shampoo on. Also, I dye my hair and this is great for keeping your color fresh and bright longer than other shampoos will leave your color. It's more expensive than regular shampoos because it is sulfate free (protects color), but it is worth it because it works WAY better than regular shampoos. Take it from someone who's tried a lot of brands!"
4612,1,"Pretty and non-toxic too_I like painting my toes in the summertime and wanted a nail polish to counteract my hot, humid climate. This polish is great for looks and protection. The coral color is gorgeous and there aren't any funky ingredients."
152,1,"Just what I wanted_I love these -- usually, the 'large' rollers in a hot set are too small and will curl your hair.  These are big enough to just give some body and shape. Theyre exactly what I wanted."
5205,1,"Exactly what I needed for my embarrassing eyebrows!_Short version: Get this brow pencil/ highlighter duo! Your sad looking eyebrows will thank you!Long version: I have dark reddish-brown hair, but my eyebrows are bizarrely light brown to almost blonde! I also have several hairs that are missing from a few tweezing mishaps. Anyway, I have been using brow pencil for a long time, but it never looked that amazing.I actually stumbled upon this, because I do like to use a highlighter right under my brow, but couldn't find one in pencil form that I liked. This is really awesome because it combines those two needs into one terrific package! Here's why it's amazing... (cue rolling out long list sound)1.) The shade really does match most skin types. As another reviewer mentioned, there are no orange tones as to look like an unnatural color. This is important, because you don't want people to actually tell that you are coloring in your shameful eyebrows!2.) The pencil is much firmer than a typical brow pencil. At first, I was surprised at home much pressure I had to use to apply this, but after trying it a few times, I really liked the look it gave. As an art teacher, I am always teaching students how to draw the human eye. We always use a finely sharpened pencil to create those fine lines on the eyelashes and eyebrows. This pencil makes it possible to actually draw realistic looking hairs if you want to! If you're in a rush, you can always smudge a little and give the idea that you actually have an eyebrow!! Either way, firm is the way to go!3.) Another plus of the firmness, is that you actually end up using less than the softer pencils. I was sharpening my old brow pencil so often, and this one keeps a nice point for a long time. Yes, you can sharpen it! You just need the right sharpener... again as an art teacher, I have access to a random assortment of tools to use for makeup!! :)4.) Lastly, the highlighter is just exactly what I was looking for! The box states several ways this can be used as a highlighter- 2 of which I normally used already. I like to highlight the inside corner of the eye as well as right below the brow line to give that extra 'push-up' as they like to call it! They also suggest using it as a concealer.. hmm! Might try it! and also as a cheek bone highlighter. I tried that this morning and it did work well! So versatile!!!Anyway, as you can tell, I am happy with this purchase and will definitely be recommending it to my make-up loving friends and family!!!"
2460,1,WoW!_Cure is the best exfoliate Ive ever used.... I use this when my clairisonic needs a new brush head. It's not harsh on the skin and you can see the dead skin coming off! It does not dry out the skin and doesn't have chemicals which irritate the skin it's great for my combination skin.
491,1,"Great neutral color._When this is applied, it is a beautiful light mauve, not the purple it looks in the bottle. I have gotten several compliments on it. It's a great cool colored neutral to wear with anything from casual to dressy. It is also a very romantic color, and would be great for summer (although I would not hesitate to wear it year round.) It also would be perfect for prom. It goes on evenly, doesn't clump up, and dries to a nice gloss. I will reorder more of this color while it is still available. Do a search on the internet of this color name and you can see multiple examples under images of how this looks on the nails. It is not a color just for young girls, but is very pretty on mature hands as well. Beautiful!"
3049,1,"Excellent value for a great product!_Remington S1051 is truly a salon quality straightener at a bargain price. I was a bit skeptical though, when I saw it compared to my favorite CHI flatiron so I put it to a test. Here are the pros and cons of this iron in my opinion:Pros.1. The first thing I loved about this iron is how lightweight it is compared to the CHI. It was much easier to style my hair due to it's lightweight. I also like the locking feature on this for easy storage.2. I love the digital temperature setting on this. Although, newer versions of CHI are digital with temp. settings, they are not as good a value in terms of price as this iron.3. Finally, the iron looks professional and straightens hair perfectly in half the cost of CHI. But is it as good as the CHI? Here is where the cons come in.Cons:1.The power button gets accidentally pressed a lot during styling since it is at the exact place where you would probably hold the iron to style the hair. However, this iron has a hold temp. button which prevents the iron from shutting off until you press the same hold temp button again, so it wasn't such a big deal for me.2. The iron takes a long time to heat up even upto 360 comapared to the CHI. I'm usually ready to style my hair within seconds with my CHI which heats up over 400 degrees. The end result the same but it's a  lot quicker with the CHI.The reason I gave it five stars is that it truly does style hair as good as the CHI in half the price, if not as quickly. So if you're not pressed for time, the Remington is a quality product at a fantastic price so take advantage!"
8848,1,"Nice Images_I received mine, one corner was slightly bent though. Otherwise the images are very cute, the details in some look very thin so I hope they come out clearly when I start stamping."
8737,1,Amazing. Such a great buy!_I am in love!! It blends like a charm.. I'll use my large flat top brush to apply the foundation then this to blend it out. Now they say that if the foundation is runny not to use it. Well I did. It soaked up enough to where it make my face look flawless. It also holds enough water for it to work. Now it is a little hard.. But it's great for my face. I don't want it to soft. I'm known to stick my fingers right through the soft ones.
6621,1,"So far so good..._I've been experiencing a bad case of Adult Acne lately, which came as a major shock considering I had very little to no acne as a teenager! The original head didn't work so great for my skin and I almost gave up...but decided to go with the 'Acne' head and I can say, while my acne is still present, it's really helped a lot.Here is one thing though, that I did notice about the specific product that was shipped to me....shipped with just the heads...not a deal breaker....also had a hard time slipping it on and half the handle itself...the grooves on the side don't look exactly like the grooves on the side of the brushhead that came with the handle. It makes me a tad suspicious...but it still worked.Not a deal breaker, but made me slightly weary. So heads up."
9463,1,"Great buy!_I purchased this led lamp due to the compact size. It is easier to take with me than the larger, full hand, lamp I own. It has cured several different brands of gel polish with no issues."
6379,1,"My favorite lotion_I use this every morning after showering and my skin feels soft and moisturizer for the entire day.  I switched to this after they changed the scent on their Collagen and Elastin lotion.  The scent isn't overpowering and instantly moisturizers.  I have the travel size in my car and handbag and keep a larger one at work. For the price, you can't beat it."
7755,1,great!_it works good on my hair! all this loreal line &#34;mythic oil&#34; nourishes hair and them looks great after this product.
1391,1,"Made for convenience!_My cousin has this case and I am sooo jealous! I love that it has the side compartments with adjustable dividers so you have the perfect size compartments and its so light weight, It really is made for convenience. Shany really thought this one through!"
6545,1,Love BCBG_I've smelled this product when it first came out and been addictive every since.Love this smell - I've love all the latest smells by BCBG
4187,0,"Broken, and wasn't what I expected_I read reviews of people saying their colors were broken and the lid was broken off, and just my luck a brown and white one was broken along with the right side of the lid! :( so sad. The colors don't look so vibrant either, however I have not tried them one because I'm giving this as a gift."
2142,1,A Favorite_This is probably my favorite VS lotion scent. I love the smell and the way it makes my skin soft with just the right about of fragrance that it isn't overpowering or too light that you can't even smell it.
7809,1,"Soft and effective._I'm very pleased with these application brushes. They are very sturdy, well made, and come in an attractive organizer case. The bristles are very soft and gentle for the most delicate of jobs. I would definitely recommend these and will buy these again!"
9390,1,"love it_This argan oil like all argan oils are wonderful. For men, you can use it to help soften your facial hair. It works wonderfully, and I recommend it to everyone. I rate this 5 stars."
1990,1,"Moisturizes Hair & Scalp_This thick white, pleasant smelling conditioner moisturized my dry scalp and color-treated hair in TEN minutes after shampooing! It smoothed my frizzies into their natural curls without tangles. THIS helps eliminate breakage for me due to less tugging and pulling while in a rush. It rinses pretty clean but leaves a coating on the hair strands; nothing heavy to weigh my hair down or leave it feeling greasy. It really made my hair feel and look good. It works well with my other hair products.It worth a try BUT I'm not sure this will replace your best working conditioner already in your hair arsenal. I'll use it as a backup or alternative to my favorite deep conditioner periodically. The NEW fragrance although pleasant bugs me as too fruity/floral and is part of the reason I only gave it 4 STARS. It smells something like perfumes my Mom or Granny would wear."
6772,1,They rock_I use these quiet often. Its kinda hard to use at first but practice makes perfect. Theyre great for any type of nail designs
3939,1,"bright and pleantiful_I purchased this product after watching some Youtube videos with different colors. I am a MAC girl, but didn't want to spend oodles of money on a color I wasn't sure about. The 1st edition of the BH Palette has a wide variety of colors including shimmer and matte. I can't say that the quality of eye shadow is on par with MAC but it is actually pretty good. The sizes are a lot bigger than I anticipated also. My palette was complete with no broken eye shadow. There is an interesting odor from the makeup I can't seem to get rid of. I don't smell it when I apply, it's just strong when I open the dispenser. I am really impressed and definitely would purchase again."
3166,1,"My lashes are not short but it still has a great length effect on me._It does not flake easily, I think it lasts a good amount of the day. It is hard to review mascaras because I think not every product works for everyone. If you want something voluminous then no but if you want to achieve more length then yes this is a good product."
7964,1,Works well on my skin tone_What ever seller I got this from I love it works well on my skin and covers dark circles will buy again but a bigger pallette
1069,1,"Works wonderfully_Every winter I battle dry, scaling skin on my browbones. I've tried a lot of different products to address the problem with minimal success. This season, I received a sample of the Murad Resurgence eye cream with another cosmetics purchase. Lucky me! I started using the sample and within just three days, the scaling had healed completely. I immediately ordered the full size and am very pleased with the product. Definitely worth the money."
565,1,Great topcoat_Lasts. Doesn't chip like others. My best. I use polish daily and I think this one is the best I have ever used.
5366,1,Great_Shany has great colored tools! I am obsessed with nail art and this acrylic nail brush set has everything you need!
3784,1,"It smells so good and doesn't give me that 'tight' feeling._Ive been using this for about a week now.  The smell is wonderful and the beads/ exforliating materials are not harsh.  This is great for day and night washing of your face, without drying your skin.  If you want more of a &#34;chemical peel&#34; type exfoliating gel, this isn't for you.  This is a very light exfoliation.  It also comes with its' own pad right on the bottle, which is rubber with little bumps on it.  A nice little prize!"
4582,1,"It really helps your skin hydrate better_I put on a few drops of this while my face is still moist from the shower of after I have spritzed mist on my face, then put on eye cream over it once it's dry, along with my moisturizer.  If you plan on putting foundation on, put more moisturizer on prior to your foundation, otherwise the hyaluronic acid may make the foundation pil slightly (but only if you use too much hyaluronic acid).  It's made my face reduce in creping, has made it look more refreshed and youthful and supple.  The seller is great, I would recommend."
8571,1,Great product_This actually competes with higher end leave in conditioners in its efficacy.  It makes my hair feel smooth and shiny and one pump is all you need so it's economical as well.
8645,1,"LOVE it_One of the best creams gels I have tried . works well with the Dermawand, because it is a gel and the price is wonderful beating the preface DermawaND GEL"
3692,1,Precision!_Love this eyeliner. So I usually use the felt tip Liquid Eyeliner pen from Victoria Secret but I needed a cheaper replacement. This has become more than a replacement! Its now in first place. I can do the &#34;cat eye&#34; look that I love to do a lot easier with this and the line is a perfect size!
4964,1,If you need a white: get this one!_It's absolutely everything I hoped for and more plain and simple. But it smells like bad bubble gum though. Enjoy!
5998,1,"Nice looking_My sister asked me to buy this product for her, i do not know anything of false eyelashes but when i saw her using it, it made me want to use them too, look beautiful."
1648,1,"Best acne fighter_Fights acne and age spots, also i notice that my skin tone is very even and the hand i apply the serum with looks more &#34;youthful&#34; than the other. I will have to switch palms up when applying to get an even affect ;)"
5394,0,NO GOOD_I JUST DIDN;T LIKE THIS PRODUCT.AT ALL.IT COST TO MUCH.AND DIDN;T DO THE JOB. IT MIGHT WORK FOR YOU.BUT NOT FOR ME.
214,1,"best curling iron i've owned_I have thin hair that hates holding curls, but this is the only curling iron i've found that gives me curls that stay in all night- and my hair is still curled when i wake up the next morning after sleeping on it! the only problem is the spirals- they are a blessing and a curse. They are great when my hair will curl inbetween them, but sometimes it just won't go in between the spirals."
2135,1,"Fantastic!_I have tired all sorts of products on my hair, but this is the best conditioner I've ever used. I normally have very dry curly hair, but within a few days of using this my hair retained moisture and became much more manageable. It also made my hair very soft. I plan to buy this conditioner again."
8845,1,Five Stars_Looks as described. Looks great.
8399,1,Love it_Great color selection. Was easy to use and looks so pretty on. Gave my nails that added bling  to attract attention.
5296,1,"Great product - frustrating packaging_I've tried a number of these types of products, and I'm very happy to have found this product.  The entire line is light, absorbs quickly, has a pleasant light fragrance, and is effective.But I do wish Neutrogena would PLEASE change the packaging to more closely resemble the Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum product in this line.  The packaging for this product and the Night repair has these flaws:1. The small pump bottle is heavy for its size, so taking it on a trip could be a problem.2. The bottle is totally opaque so there is no earthly way to tell how much is left.  The entire bottle is covered in silver paint, so you cannot see inside.  The bottom of the bottle is painted, as the entire side.  If they left a strip unpainted on the side, you could see the quantity in the bottle.3. The Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum product is in a very different container - it also has a pump top, but it is attached to a tube rather like a small toothpaste tube - a much, MUCH better system! The tube is very lightweight, and as it flattens you can see how much you've used, and it also holds 1 oz.4. It is almost impossible for me, with my later middle aged eyes, to tell the difference between the SPF 30 product and the Night product! There needs to be something that makes it easy to tell-a different color top, a different color ink on the label, something! I have to put on my glasses every single night and every single morning to make sure I am using the right product. Gad, that is frustrating.Do try this entire line, however.  Neutrogena has hit another out of the ballpark!"
5071,1,"Buy it at a beauty store instead._They have overpriced this item partially because of shipping costs. You can find this same item at Sally's Beauty Supply for almost $2.69I am biracial- asian/caucasian with straight, course hair. My hair gets pretty limp so I have to experiment woth all different products without having my hair flat. I pair this with Nexxus promend and it seems to do the job. First off, the scent is amazing and I have already seen growth in my hair since I bleached it 3days ago."
6710,1,Awesome_This is a great deal! I can't wait to buy it so I can buy those new gel nail polishes and do it at home! Shany is awesome!
6010,1,A great price for the product_After asking around it doesn't sound like the base coat is always necessary but I figured I would be better safe then sorry. I haven't noticed a big difference using the base coat but I really like the thickness of the top coat. I have tried others that are similar but this was a good price for the product.
1463,1,"Decent, I like it_My absolute favorite brow product is from Lancome but we don't always have nearly $30 to spend on a eyebrow pencil (though they last a long time). I bought this to hold me over. Ultimately, I like it. My only problems are that, I wish the pencil was a bit larger and I wish the gel was a bit darker.I got dark blond and the pencil is fine but the brow-set gel seems to be a much lighter blond, so when it catches the light you can see the difference between where the pencil is and where the gel is - not a fan. Next time I'll probably nab a light brown and just be more gentle with the pencil and go heavier with the gel. The pencil is waxy but pigmented, which is great fora brow pencil and the gel holds all hairs in place. If you need an inexpensive brow kit, I'd get this. Though I also suggest using an angled brush and a matte eyeshadow of the right color to go over the pencil work before setting, though you could definitely just use this."
2876,1,"Best Mascara Ever!_I've been using this product for over 10 years when you could easily buy Max Factor make-up at your local drugstore.  I've tried expensive brands and cheaper brands and this mascara is by far the best I've ever used.  It really elongates the lashes and makes them full.  It flakes a little, but so did the more expensive brands.  I wish Max Factor would come back to the U.S.  I would highly recommend this mascara for the price and quality."
7179,1,"Nice colors_Very beautiful and the colors are so bright, great product and easy to work with. I would buy again. Beautiful"
6826,1,"Nice pallette_The Balm Nude Tude palette first came to my attention on Youtube.  I got my taxes and decided I must try some of this 'high end' makeup.  I love the packaging and the names.  The lid is magnetic so it snaps shut and you don't have to worry about powder everywhere.  The names of the shades are cute as hell.  The shadows for the most part are pigmented and easy to apply and blend.  This is a complete palette meaning you have both matte and shimmer in complimentary colors so you can do a basic to dramatic eye with just this palette.  IT is a great neutral palette.  I do not have Naked by UD so I can't compare. MY order got cancelled.  But I am happy I purchased this.  Beware though. I did purchase the Balm Jovi palette as well and it seems that some colors repeat just different names but both still great.  Mostly it is the highlighter colors and we can't have enough of those.  I love that you can go to amazon and get good prices on expensive things.  I recommend The Balm cosmetics in general for their packaging, Whimsical names and quality of product.  It might be a while before I get another though as they are pricey but if you feel like indulging yourself and keeping up with the beauty community this is a must have.  Also the Balm Jovi rockstar palette.  It is great."
5953,1,"superb cheapy conditioner_I won't bore anyone with stuff everyone already said, but for natural ladies who like rocking mini twists and don't want to be all day taking them down -- applying this product, water, and using a denman or denman-knock off will instantly detangle hair like a dream.  After I was done detangling, I kept the conditioner in for a deep conditioner treatment.  My hair was moisturized and soft.  The product can as well be used as prepoo, cowash, rinse out, and leave in.  Has a nice apple, faint smell.  I've bought 3 bottle definetly a staple!"
7709,1,"Finally!_What can I say? I just LOVE this contouring kit. I've already tried so many different bronzers and contour palettes just trying to find the perfect match for me. Finally, I have found one that provides the look I was desiring. I have a naturally tan complexion, so a lot of the contouring kits I see truly aren't dark enough to create appropriate shadows unless you are more fair. At first I was worried that this was going to be entirely too dark or that it would leave me looking dirty, but it's actually perfect. A little bit goes a LONG way, so I know I'll be holding on to this for a good while. If you want that chiseled look, this is the kit you're going to want. As for the highlighter, it's very pretty yet it's not very light, so I personally brush it on top of my other highlighting product for an additional pink glow. It's more of a blush. Though this would be far too dark for any fair to medium complexioned girl, this is great if you're a deeper olive to dark complexioned girl."
4205,0,"Expensive mistake_The store was out of Burt's Bees so I bought this instead. I didn't realize until I got home and opened the box it has a pump with no way to get at the inside of the container. I find that packaging wasteful. The pump itself also wastes a lot of product. Pump it once and enough for 12 people comes out. Even a very thin coat made my face very shiny, and it feels heavy on the skin like it is not sinking in. Finally, others have mentioned a very light, pleasant lotion fragrance, which I noticed as well, but after it goes on it has a strong mildew odor. That for me was the deal breaker. My hands stink after applying it, and my eyes are burning."
8676,1,Hair looks & feels so much better..._I've been using this Conditioner every other day for about a week now along with the matching shampoo daily.  I'm loving the results.My Hair- My hair feels so much softer and healthier now. It feels lighter too which is giving it better volume even when I don't use a hair dryer.  This conditioner give it a nice silkiness and takes away any and all tangles.Frizz- Although my hair looks better I don't notice a huge difference in the frizz. The frizz doesn't look as bad as it did prior to using this but it's still there.I would recommend trying this conditioner along with the shampoo. I have a bit of scalp itchiness from the shampoo but hopefully others don't have that problem. I really like the results my hair itself has had. I've been using the Smooth Infusing Serum too. I think they're all a pretty good combination.
7286,1,Five Stars_I love this product .
5975,1,Love 'em!_Thrilled with these lashes!  The lashes give a nice full look without being overly long and exaggerated.  Nice daytime look.  Will buy again.
8466,1,"Not Bad_Most 2-in-1 products are good at cleaning and mediocre at conditioning, and Axe has not bucked that trend with their Apollo scent shampoo plus conditioner.  However, it does leave my hair feeling softer than most 2-in-1s and may be just right for guys with hair that is weighed down easily.  The scent is strong and pleasant, if a bit artificial.  It lingers for a long time and irritates my eyes a little.Overall, I think this is a good product for the gym and I like the bottle, but I prefer other products for home use."
2211,0,"Makes your polish chip faster_I've used Seche Vite for a long time, but I always resist buying ANOTHER bottle when I start getting low, because this stuff makes my polish chip like nothing I've ever seen. It's really pretty before the shine dulls (3-4 days), and it DOES dry my nails super-fast, but I'd prefer my nail polish not chip between manis (every week). The reason it makes your polish chip is that something weird in the formula makes every layer of polish on your nail kind of 'melt' together into just one layer. If you ding your nailtip, a single layer will chip off much easier than layer over layer over layer. I might give away the bottle I have right now because it irritates me so much. This product would be perfect if it didn't also contribute to polish-chipping."
8484,1,Good Gel_This wet shine gel does give hair with a nice shine without leaving hair with a stiff feeling. My husband loves his gel and only needs a tiny but of this gel to achieve his desired look. A very high quality product!
2565,1,"Pink!_I do my own nails, acrylics or gels and these tips were just what I was looking for. Easy to buff the smile line and blend in."
3558,1,"Amazing set_Really soft, except for the powder and blush brushes not so soft, amazing complete set with a good pice. I believe it really worths it"
2834,1,"A must for the flower child or adult!_I got these for my daughter. There is a variety of sizes and the colors pink, purple and white. What I love about these clips is that they work in my daughter's fine hair, but they also hold back my own hair. Overall I'm very satisfied with this product. They'd be great as party favors or just as a stocking stuffer for a little girl!**1/11 update - these are still in use! The clips have not broken. The white flowers got dirty over time, but I'm amazed by the durability!"
5599,1,"Even waterproof makeup comes off!_I used these whole I was traveling and they're perfect for taking off even waterproof eyeliners and mascaras. Just be careful not to get it in your eyes, as it does burn quite a bit!"
9248,1,Good product_Item was as described. This is a good seller.This is a good product and such a good deal for all that you get.
2545,1,Cute gloves_The gloves are cute and will most likely do the trick. The shipment was speedy and the price was reasonable. Would recommend this to anyone. My rating was based on  because I have not been able to try it out yet to see if it was a five star or not.
2837,1,A lot for a little_All I can say is wow all these nails for such a small cost and the shipping was like a day! I love that.  Others said these nails were tips but I don't get why they r full cover nails. Very pleased and will order again
7854,0,nice_nice i like it alot reccomened by me so buy it bc i said so ok? ok. swag doe aye
7449,1,"Nice Conditioner, Rinses Well_I've been coloring my hair for too long to mention... There is a point that my hair starts to go from beautiful and shiny and newly colored to looking more rundown and dry.So after trying this conditioner for awhile, I would say it is a nice one, I'm not sure if it makes a difference with dyed hair but that's a tough one to measure. It smells okay, rinses well and has a really thick consistency.I also like the convenience of the container. It opens on the bottom and stands up solid. So it is always coming out from the bottom instead of having to be squeezed from the top.For the price, it's a nice conditioner and a good deal."
5404,1,BEST BRONZER EVER_I AM AMAZED BY THIS PRODUCT!! one time using it and i was completely brown!! and it smells so amazing!!! it smells like fruits which is weird because tanning lotion usually smells horrible!
8716,1,love the color_What is there to say about OPI is that they always have the prettiest colors and this color is beautiful is opaque I only needed one coat when I applied for a manicure. Highly recommended
4037,1,"A product that does what it claims!_I, too, am disappointed with the price increase of RapidLash over the last few months.  It's about a $15 increase, but $38 is still a lot to spend for a beauty product.  I only continue to buy it from here because of 2 reasons:  It's about $12 less expenisve than if you buy it in the store or at the RapidLash online site and it works!  Now, when I say it works, I'm not saying my lashes look as if I'm wearing false lashes.  It is a subtle difference that without mascara only I can tell.  My lashes now curl on their own, there are more of them and with one coat of mascara only, I look as if I had applied a lash primer and 2 coats of mascara.  So even with the price increase, I will stick to Rapidlash for now unless the price keeps increasing.  It still beats Lastisse in price...that's for sure.  And one tube lasts me about 3 months (I'll sometimes forget a day or two during the week).The only other negative I can say about this product, besides the price increase, is that it took a lot longer to work for me than they claimed it would.  It was so disappointing reading that some people noticed results after just 2-3 weeks.  For me, it was more like 7-8 weeks before I even started to notice a small difference.  I've been using it for over a year now and they are even longer and fuller but still not fake eyelash looking.  It's like I have a couple more rows of lashes, too. I'm almost 49 years old, and the older you get the thinner, shorter and sparser your lashes get.  Since I never had long, thick lashes in my lifetime, I need all the help I can get.  So I would definitely recommend this product to others.  I is so worth it!"
1957,0,"Meh._It's not great, it's not awful. I guess I was expecting more based on so many good reviews... it doesn't clean my skin, it doesn't clear my pores, to be totally honest it doesn't really do anything. I even bought the good apple vinegar for it, and it didn't make any difference. It smells bad and it's harder to get off than most face masks. I'm pretty disappointed."
913,1,QUEEN HELENE MINT_I bought this due to a particular reinforcement that I needed in a Mask. I actually saw that Tamar Braxton uses this. I tried it and LOVE the results..it is certainly worth the price.
5461,1,"LOved Loved LOved it_I bought this in the store and I was skeptical because most conditioners didnt work well with my hair,which is partially course..This ocnditoner made my hair instantly soft and manageable which helped me so much with detangling it..So this is my new favorite cheapy conditioner..Will use this for my cowashes from now on"
7363,1,"SO bright and pretty, but it bleeds and disappears_I was expecting this to really stay put based on other reviews.  It stays pretty well relative to most drugstore brands, but I still had to reapply it frequently over a 3-hour period, even when I gave it like 5 minutes to dry.  It also tends to migrate (um... ALL OVER your face if you aren't careful... mind where you put your hands if you touch your lips, because this stuff is like PAINT), particularly to the edges and corners of the lips, and to the teeth (I suspect strongly that a bit of lip liner and some loose powder might at least lessen this problem, however).  You literally only need a tiny dot (like the head of a pin) to do each lip because it has so much pigment.  On the plus-side, the color is stunning.  I don't think I could resist wearing this again, and would consider purchasing another color in the future (as I will literally never run out of this color)."
2408,1,"Very easy to use!_Very easy to use, especially for someone who hasn't used a cuticle pusher before.  I wanted my nails to look healthier so decided I needed to invest in a pusher and this works great."
4331,0,Smelled better in the store_I think I bought too much and the novelty wore off early so if you like it I recommend buying a small sample first.
3931,1,"Needs a second mascara, but wow_On the advice of a beauty blogger I bought this along with the 'millions' mascara, also in carbon black. Alone this mascara was underwhelming. It was OK, but nothing that totally blew me away. But coupled with the millions mascara, WOW! Combined I looked like I had false lashes on (in the good way). I will continue buying them as a pair as long as I can because this makes even the high end expensive mascaras look wimpy."
54,1,"The real deal when purchased through Amazon_This has been my significant other's favorite cologne for years and years.  We purchased this directly through Amazon (NOT a reseller) and received the legit product.  Contrary to other reviews, he has not noticed any change in the product's scent or strength.  The price can't be beat and after checking various online options (like Sephora), I was not able to find the legitimate product for a lower price."
6726,1,"Happy, Happy, Happy_When I ordered my brushes I was told that they wouldn't arrive before the new year, but they arrived 2 days before Christmas. The brushes are really good, especially for the price of them. The &#34;leather&#34; smell was slightly strong on arrival and had went away. (Leave them out and open for 24 hrs before use). Their product application is mediocre, but after a quick wash and dry that also improved. So, I'm happy, happy, happy."
3389,1,"The one better matches my Asian skin tone_When I first heard of BB Cream on TV, I went to amazon.com to poke around and read the reviews. Then I went to Youtube to check out the videos.  There are a number that demonstrate the various kinds of BB cream but still difficult to decide what works for me.  Once I became aware of the types of BB creams and manufacturers, I went onto the manufacturer's website to check out the ingredients, the color, and what type of skin the BB cream is good for.After having bought 5 different kinds and receiving 2 from a friend in Asia and tried them all, the Missha M Perfect BB Cream #23 is the one - for me.  All of the rest are simply too light in color and the Missha M Perfect BB Cream #27 is more yellow.Here's about me. I have Asian skin. No tan. Not pale. Don't wear makeup. Have some small freckles and small dark spots from the sun - nothing dramatic though. Skin toward sensitive and dry side.What I like about this BB Cream - M Perfect # 23:1. It's light and smooth when pumped out.2. It has a grey looking tone - don't really like at first sight - and upon initially put on the face, the color looks lighter shade than my skin color.  But after 15 minutes, the grey tone goes away, the color shade blends well with my skin tone.3. Here's the best - it evens out my skin tone.  Red areas not as red, freckles not as obvious. It just produces an overall better and even looking face. Since I don't wear makeup, I really am not looking for foundation stuff to cake up my face.4. It has 42 SPF.  If nothing at all, use it as sun screen because it is not oily like the typical sun screen.5. It lasts all day and does not irritate.6. I only use half a pump, if that much, and still have left over for the neck.I've recommended this BB Cream #23 to my sister, sister-in-law, daughter and a friend.  They are all using this one now.  The only wish they have is that this BB cream is a tad darker.  But it's still very good as is."
6960,1,gorgeousssss_as how they describe it and same exact thing as how it is on the picture i love them i cant wait to try them on
2435,1,I like it !_i like it so far i have less break out i think it work i would recommend this to a friend.
5407,1,Very organised!_The pictures do not do it justice. There are several pockets on the outside so everything is organised and you can see everything
6225,1,"Great Product_Great color, I love the smoothness when you apply it.  Long lasting and very affordable. I would buy it again."
3089,1,excellent brush_I bought this to do my gel manicures at home. It is a nice brush with perfect length handle. Nice soft bristles.
8742,0,WARNING! Pantene BB Cream_WARNING! One use ruined my (thick coarse) hair. Suddenly hair almost breaking off. Crispy and worse. I changed nothing else. Product smells wonderful and to this day I still smell it when flat ironing and so theres no doubt it was that cream that did the damage. To still smell after 8 months is to penatrate the hair shaft Big Time. DO NOT BUY.
1247,1,"Luscious Product_Great ingredients, nicely scented and a wonderfully creamy product.  I will be ordering it again and again as I like to pair it with a scrub and give it as a gift."
5773,1,Thanks youtube!_...thanks youtube because if its not the tutorials I wouldn't know about good brushes!?...this stipling brush works very well i'm glad I have one!
1264,1,I dicovered this years ago_It is the only hair reconstructor I would bet my life on! I wish it would come down in price though.
6204,1,"Great Luminess substitute_I use it in my Luminess Airbrush system, the coverage is amazing and it looks flawless, plus it is water based."
4892,1,"Better made and perfect size to use as a baby/adult Wipe_This size is great if you prefer to make your own baby/adult wipes without the chemicals that are in the ones at the store.  Just keep these handy, along with a pump dispenser filled with Witch Hazel, and you can squirt some on the pad and make your own baby/adult wipe."
9400,0,"Be wary of the fake reviews!_So, just a heads up to those of you who are thinking, &#34;Wow! So many 5 star reviews!&#34;  I started to read them all, but then decided to click on the &#34;See my reviews&#34; buttons next to people's names.  If you do the same, you will notice that almost all of these &#34;rave&#34; reviews come from people whom have ONLY written reviews for Phytoworx products.  I thought you should all know, as seeing this has changed my mind regarding buying this product.  Looks like there are either lots of fake reviews or lots of people who only found it necessary to write a review for this one product."
5076,1,"This is what I was looking for_I have very thinning hair from illness and medication used to treat it. I like to keep my hair back, so it doesn't fall into what I am doing (seriously) I had trouble finding these locally. I tried the thinner ones (just do not stay in) and the silicone ones (just tangle up what little I have) but these work and stay in, for me...thanks"
956,1,the best moisturizer_i am a product junkie always looking for my next fix.  i stopped looking after I found this product.  once you get past the not great scent the bottom line is my skin stays moist and soft all day and some.  side note - i'm 63 yrs old.
6073,1,"My hair is still stick straight three days later_Wow. I felt this really helped me flatten my hair quickly, but that's not even the best part. When I flat iron my own hair (as opposed to going to the salon), it usually kinks up at least a little the next day. But I'm on day three now and my hair is still perfectly straight. I'm not sure how much protection it provides, but the straightening/lasting aspect is great!"
5647,1,grandaughter_gift for her nails to experiment and she loves them sh copiise nails that are done on pinterest and can with these
608,1,Cleaning Gel_Another 5 star for Peter Thomas Roth!!!  This has got to be the best facial cleanser that I have ever tried!  I just wish that his products were cheaper but they are &#34;all&#34; well worth the price in.
3571,1,"Deviously Delicious!_I love Bert's Bees stuff. However when purchasing this product I was at first, a little on the fence about it. It smelled a bit weird to me and I couldn't quite figure out what it was, until it hit me. This stuff smells like chocolate, like a package of Swiss Rolls and honey. I find the smell quite intoxicating and I love the butter itself, it is a little sticky but not overwhelmingly so. It takes a bit to work into the skin if you have globs and globs on, but if you use a sparing amount (as a little bit goes a long way here) it glides on and absorbs quickly. It also leaves my skin feeling soft and healthy, and as an added bonus for me I smell like chocolate and honey. Whats not to love? I also dab a very (very!) tiny amount onto my palms and run them through my damp hair as I am getting out of the shower, as it makes my hair super soft but not weighed down or oily. I have really dry skin, especially in the winter and this stuff nips it in the bud. Great for dry, itchy skin that other products can't touch. Love this stuff, and will be purchasing more!"
2102,1,"Surprised_I have been coloring my own hair for 30 years, but have mostly used professional grade products.  Thought I would give this a try, and was very surprised at the ease, the time, the depth of color, and the coverage of grey.  Will definitely buy again.  Very pleased."
538,1,"Nice floral scent_Of all the Aubrey organic shampoos I have tried, this is the one I most prefer. Its all-natural formula gets my hair clean and leaves it smelling floral and feminine. Doesn't dry or strip hair.The corresponding conditioner is a little thick, but I added some water to the bottle and found it was just right. It leaves my hair silky-soft and manageable. Again, the floral scent is a huge plus. I would recommend these products for any woman with normal to dry hair."
4002,1,"Gives a lovely rosy glow to the skin (#230, Lush Berry)_After years of putting up with powder blush, I went in search of a gel or cream blush that would look better on my dry skin.  For a while I was usingPixi - Sheer Cheek Gel - Natural, which I liked but found to be a bit pricey for what you get.  Wanting a pinker shade of blush (I never tried the Pixi Rosy tone because it looks so dark in the tube) I decided to try Sculpting Blush Lush Berry.  I am so glad that I did!I apply the blush with my fingers because I just don't like using the sponge.  To me, using the sponge just wastes product, as so much ends up in the sponge and ultimately gets thrown away.  I find that the Sculpting Blush glides on easily over either moisturizer or foundation.  It's easily smoothed into even color, and a little goes a long way.  The color is not harsh or too red.  Some other reviewers found that the color faded after a while, but I have not noticed that.I have always thought of CoverGirl as being a cheap (i.e. poor quality) makeup brand, but this product really changed my mind. I also purchased theCoverGirl & Olay Simply Ageless Corrector 230, 0.3-Ounce Panand am similarly impressed with it.  I am really happy with these products, and will be trying out the Simply Ageless Foundation as well."
2607,1,"Best Conditioner Out There!!_My girlfriend told me about this conditioner so I bought a small foil pack from my beauty supply store. WOW - what a great product! I had been using another fabulous conditioner (Pantene Fortifying Fortifier) but it is getting more difficult to find. I am transitioning from relaxed to natural (curly) hair and so I have two completely different textures that are very fragile and hard to manage. I shampooed my hair normally, put the whole Root Stimulator pack on my hair, covered with a plastic cap and towel and went about my business for an hour. No heat was necessary. When I removed the cap, my hair was so soft and smelled great - like a light orange sorbet. Plus my little curls were so well defined! After I rinsed and blow dried, the difference was unbelievable. I highly recommend this conditioner and fully intend to stock up on it. The price is right and the results are amazing.UPDATE: Now that I'm 100% natural, it doesn't work as well as some other conditioners to clump my curls. For some reason, it's not as easy for me to comb this conditioner through as it was when the ends were still straight. I still highly recommend it for transitioners but as for all natural girls and guys, there are better products out there for us."
2526,1,Nice Product!_This conditioner really does cause your hair to look thicker. Since it makes my hair look fuller I do not have to shampoo as often!
4675,0,"Not for me._If you dress up a lot in costumes this is a great product for you. Please ladies don't make yourself look like a crazy psychopathic bride of chuck doll wearing these thick, hard, plastic lashes!"
6944,1,"Works great!_This product does exactly what what it says it does.  The 'fine' lines around my eyes and my laugh lines seemed to nearly dissapear.  It evened out my skin tone and made my makeup look more matte, I do have a few dark spots that it really didn't do anything for - but I did not expect it to.  I have combo skin, a little oily in my t-zone and normal everywhere else.  I did not experience any of the flaking or balling during the day that some of the reviewers experienced, I did allow the primer to set before appying anything else to my face for about 5 to 7 mins.  I love this product, would 100% recomened it to a friend and will certainly purchase this product again!,"
466,1,"I absolutely love this water spray_I absolutely love this water spray. It keeps my face moisturized in a dry climate and heals any acne or small skin infections. I always carry the small bottle with me, too. It comes in very handy."
1141,1,"good_Works well, protect my hair form the heat.Will purchase again in store.s ea ar arew gr gra fe"
3329,1,"Great cleanser_Great product!!!!!  I have had trouble with my skin for the longest time until I realized I was OVER doing it with my sensitive skin.  After using this product and using a moisturizer regularly, my skin has cleared up, looks healthier and more luminous.  I particularly like this in the mornings, though it isn't bad in taking off makeup too - just need a wash cloth or cotton pad as well.  If you have sensitive problem skin, this is definitely worth a shot.  I've already purchased another for when mine runs out."
4349,1,"Like it_It is my first dehydrate product ever, so I do not have anything to compare it with. But I think it works very well, and the good thing is - it lasts really long."
8336,1,"Another great AXE product_The entire Axe line offers men an excellent option when purchasing H&BA.;Always scented with a manly appeal , and an excellent value for the money  (as only a little bit is needed for desired results), the entire Axe line continues its tradition of a quality product , producing great results , for not a lot of money."
7098,1,"so far so good ..._I've been using this derma roller for about 3 months now, once a week.  I haven't had any bad side affects.  I'm mainly trying to get rid of some age spots on my cheeks, so I alternate between fade cream and vitamin C serum.  I saw immediate results as far as the appearance of my skin (less blemishes, glowing skin, even tone, no more dry flakey skin).  I'm just now noticing a lightening of my dark spots, but I still have a ways to go. I will continue to use it and report back in a few more months.Update - 3/27/13:  It's been a little over two more months since I've been using this weekly.  Again, I'm happy with the healthy appearance of my skin, but I'm not seeing any further improvement to my age/sun spots.  Perhaps I need to try a different serum!  Be sure to do this treatment at night before you go to bed ... the redness will be gone by morning.  I'm wondering if anyone has tried this on their decollatage or if that area is too delicate."
5150,1,Long lasting_This is a long lasting lipstick. The first that actually stays longer than 6 hours. Does not smudge at all.
8217,1,"Just about a perfect fit for me_This is a nice non-scented moisturizer that goes on smoothly. Even with a healthy dose of it as a night cream, it doesn't feel greasy or heavy and you don't have to wait for it to absorb into the skin before applying foundation. I like that it has a sunscreen, but I haven't been able to test-drive it yet. It's still winter in Seattle and not a lot of sunshine :)All in all a very good moisturizer for this price range. My only quibble and it's a very small one is how the moisturizer is dispensed. I'm partial to a pump method instead of picking up, opening a lid, turning it upside down and then squeezing. I'm lazy that way, but YMMV."
1542,1,"Nice and creamy moisturizer, non greasy too_The CeraVe Moisturing Cream is a nice and rich moisturizer. I use it on my face at night and in the morning. It is creamy, but not greasy. It is non-irritating too. Very happy with this purchase.PROS:- Rich moisturizer- Non-greasyCONS:- None"
3780,1,Stronger hair_I've bought this product at the local drug store.  The price on Amazon is great.  I love the subscribe and save products.  I also like the fact that it really does work.  I use it every night before I go to bed.  It soaks it and doesn't make your hair greasy or anything.  I have had three different people try it and they say that they can notice a difference after just one use.
1490,1,"More payout than Nars Orgasm_I love Nars blushes, but as soon as I tried this color it became my everyday blush. It is very pigmented and the pan is HUGE. It is rosy gold, but seems to look flattering on most skin types including my fair skin."
7589,1,"Very pretty!_It is what it is and it works great, my daughter and her friends love it too!  Turn the cap different directions for added fun."
6515,1,"Love the color palette_Had to give this a try with all the positive reviews. I've been using this for several weeks now, love the color choices and how it stays on the whole day. When I'm at work, I don't have time to apply more makeup so this is great. The price can't be beat and the &#34;smallness&#34; of each color doesn't bother me. Ask yourself: have you ever used ALL of one color from one of those store brands before you grew tired of it?"
6340,1,"Lightweight for a night cream, absorbs well_This Own product is definitely non-greasy, and is very light compared to other night-moisturizing creams I've used. The cream absorbs readily, and does not take long to massage into facial skin. The rub? I don't think it's as effective as the other creams I've used in the past, and those fine little lines are creeping back into view since I switched to this product! So, the truth will be in the using over the next month as I use it up. I'm hoping I'm wrong, because I definitely like the lightweight feeling, and want it to work so I finally have the perfect nighttime product."
9612,1,"Gentle and convenient, but spendy_I have used Cetaphil's facial wash on and off for years and have always been pleased with it, so I was happy to see that the brand has come out with a more portable version. These Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleansing Cloths are a great for travel or on the go, when lugging around a pump bottle of cleanser isn't practical. They do a decent job of washing my face and removing my make-up at the end of the day, although the formula is too gentle to remove waterproof mascara. i like the gentle formula, though. After cleansing my face with these wipes, my skin feels soft and comfortable, not dry and tight like some cleansers can leave it.The only improvement that I would make to this product would be to make the cloths are little wetter. I would prefer there be a little more solution on them so that I feel like I am washing my face rather than simply wiping it clean. There is no need to wipe  your face (or hands or whatever) dry after using these, however, so that could be considered a positive for some folks.At over $7 for a pack of 25 wipes, these Cetaphil cloths are on the spendy side, so I would not use them every day. For travel, though, I think they're great...a convenient, good-quality product."
2476,1,"amazing, refreshing.&#9825;_This product, I recieved as a sample, then recieved for christmas. I adore it no complaints whatsoever.it makes you feel refreshed, and your skin feel nice and soft. I would say, that this is more than a five star product its a ten. &#9733;"
4295,1,Adds a lot of volume_Adds a lot of volume but makes the hair rather sticky and you really can't brush or comb through your hair after using it. Almost like hair spray but that said I have thin hair and this helps a lot.
4390,1,"Great For Skin and Hair_I bought this because I had heard rave reviews about it on natural Black hair websites, and I'd also heard what it can do for your skin. It's good stuff, really thick, so I don't think it would make a good daily hair oil, but it's definitely good in a small amount in a mixture of oils, and in skin products. I mixed mine in both a shea butter concoction and hair oil concoction (both in a style similar to Youtube's Naptural85), and I'm very satisfied. The bottle looks small, but it does go a long way, and I still have more than half, although I do use it sparingly."
4224,1,"LOVE THIS PRIMER_I bought this right after buying the &#34;Rimmel&#34; primer, and I love the e.l.f brand so much more, I dont have to wait for it to dry and it holds  my make up in place all day long. Which is great because I work in fast food so I'm moving around alot. Great for the first time ever using primer! Great price too!"
7148,1,"This product is very nice_Frankly, I have no idea if it's &#34;correcting dark spots&#34;, but it's a great primer for moisturizer and makes my skin feel great."
9431,1,Another good product from John Frieda_I use the John Frieda shampoo and conditioner for red heads so I got this to complement that set. I found that it did give my color a boost but it wasn't instantaneous. It took about a week to see a noticeable difference in my red hair but there was an extra sheen to it pretty quickly. To give you a reference I dye the ends of my hair a &#34;fire engine red&#34; color so I spend a good bit of time finding products to counteract the fading. It has done an excellent job in addition to the shampoo and conditioner. I do want to disclose that I have not tried this as a standalone. I will caution though that there will be red run off in your shower and that I would wind up with a random red spot on my hairline or scalp. Personally the trade off for the results outweighed this but it was an inconvenience.
6544,1,"Fantastic!_This stuff is fantastic - it's so nourishing, smells great and leave hair silky smooth and fully conditioned. A little goes a long way!"
3926,1,"Great colors for green eyes!_The only complaint I would have is the brushes are small & hard to handle.  Also, where you are to apply each color is imprinted in the powder, so if you wear it off, you won't know which shade is to be applied where."
9551,1,"Not Just for Guys_This face wash is for guys??  Uh-oh.  I didn't realize that when I requested it or first used it.I'm definitely of the female gender.  Doesn't matter, I love the stuff anyway.The only thing that seems to make this a male-oriented product is the scent.  It is a fresh, outdoorsy, woodsy scent that I really like.  So for a few minutes, I smell more like a forest than an orchid.  Big deal.It lathers nicely.  It cleans well and makes my skin feel fresh.  It rinses off easily.  And, at current prices, it is less expensive than many of the products marketed for women.  Despite my chromosomes, I'm very happy with this product."
8729,1,Peacock hair clip hairpins_Received it and boy was i happy it is beauitful and it is colorful and my finace even thought it was pretty thanks so much for the peacocks they are all very pretty love them will order again.....thanks
4841,1,Love it for French Manicure_I used this for the base of a french manicure and think it looks great.  I only did one coat because I was afraid 2 would be too pink.  It is very sparkly.
4031,1,"great for coloring hair_I use this product everyday.  I color my hair and it has gotten coarser and frizzier with age.  This product calms my hair down and makes it sooooo soft.  My hairdresser gave me the tip of applying it before I color (diy) to help condition my hair and make it easier to comb the color through.  It also makes it easier to get the color off the skin around the hair line.  A little goes a long way, so I don't have to feel guilty for indulging in this product!"
6628,1,"Great polish, but not for everyone_I personally LOVE this polish, however I found that I had to use three coats in order to get the desired coverage that I wanted. BUT I got sooo many compliments on it, and it seems to stick on very well. I wish I had had a chance to try the other colors from this collection other than Meep Meep Meep. I think what is often not taken into consideration with this polish is the fact that it is a clear based nail polish and is VERY see through, no matter how many coats are applied, but as I said, I use three and I get a great amount of coloring and it looks fantastic"
6259,1,"I screamed every time i opened a bottle!_Yes, its true! I ordered this package 2 days before it was delivered, which was a huge surprise, because it said it would take a week or more until it would come! So for that I was delighted!Each bottle came in a plastic blue net, and all were neatly piled in the foam peanuts! None were cracked, ruined, dry or anything. I also didnt get ANY duplicates!!! In the box I received every color I had hoped for, and it came with a bunch of holos, chunkys, neons, LOTS of sparkles, shiny, mattes, and a base coat! I am very pleased with this product!"
1426,1,great buy_I just love this bubble bath. I bought this so I could relax and it really does it. leaves the skin very soft and with a nice lavender aroma . I really feel very at ease and relaxed after one of these baths. It helps me have a nice nap on weekends whenever I have to go out  at night.
4378,1,"Compliments Galore!_Almost every time I wear this denim color pencil with my hazel eyes, I get compliments. I wear it just about every day. What more do I need to say?"
2505,1,"Bright red_Great for renewing color I got lots of compliments.  When I first used it, I thought the color was too bright but everybody seemed to like it.  So, I'm sold!"
1759,0,"I'm disappointed._I know that the product is supposed to blend in with your skin, but it didn't really give my skin that even look from where your face is red, etc. I could've gotten the same effect with lotion. I expected more from it, and since I used it I won't be getting my $6 back."
1450,1,"excellent_Exquisite fragrance for men, its aroma is citrusy and woodsy at the same time, fresh and very durable taps on the skin."
2352,1,Fantastic_I use them to remove the sticky residue with the gelish gel cleanser and sometimes even to remove the nail polish itself.  Great for soaking off the gelish polish.  Seller is great and i'll definitely buy from them again
4539,1,"Pantene Pro-v Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy To Smooth Shampoo_This tamed and smoothed my long, salt and pepper hair without making it feel flat and lifeless.  I am loving this shampoo.Sometimes conditioner can weigh my hair down, so I try not to use it that often.  I don't have to use any conditioner when I use this shampoo.  It gives my hair the perfect blend of bounce and shine, with beautiful body.  I also like that it smells fresh and clean, not like perfume.Pantene has always been a favorite shampoo of mine.  I'm happy with this line of hair product as it exactly targets what my hair needs!"
5162,1,"A good set but a bit over hyped._The package of this product screams 'SUPER SCIENCE!' but in reality the contents are far more tame.  The Youth Code set contains three items: a generous sized moisturizer with SPF, a small tube of eye cream, and a pot of heavy morning/evening cream.  I can already tell that I'm going to go through the pot of cream very quickly; I can't eyeball how much is left of the eye cream but I suspect it will be equally short lived.  I'll review each of the products individually and then as a group.The moisturizer with SPF: This is a very light and clean feeling moisturizer.  It goes on easily and disappears quickly; two small pumps were enough to cover my whole face.  It makes an excellent base for foundations and other make-up.  I rate this piece 5 stars.The under-eye cream: The tube this comes in looks very odd, almost obscene-- but it works well and after a week of applications I can put it on very quickly, with just two swipes.  It's heavier than the moisturizer, and I also noted that after I got home from my in-laws house, whose dog I am allergic to, my skin was a little raw and the eye cream actually burned for about 20 seconds.  Unpleasant.The pot of lotion: Very nice texture, feels almost whipped.  Sinks in quickly, leaves face feeling fresh rather than sticky.  In terms of heavy lotions this could easily go up against the department store creams I've purchased in the past and is much more reasonable in price!  Again, some pain when applied to very sensitive or mildly irritated skin.As a set, these lotions work fine, but they'd work equally well separately.  I'd be tempted to just continue with the light SPF lotion and save the pot for when my skin needs some real help, like after being out in the snow.  In terms of anti-aging, I have a few small areas of concern and I did not notice anything above and beyond the usual plumping associated with adding a nice quality lotion to my face; but I don't have fine lines, so I can't speak to that.  I suspect that all the SUPER SCIENCE here is just another fancy way to sell what is quite simply a fine lotion.  No miracles, but I can't say I was disappointed."
2768,1,"Great for swimmers_I use this after swimming, after using a chlorine shampoo.  Works great for me.  My hair is hennaed though and not chemically dyed, which means it acts more like virgin hair as in it isn't super dry.  This stuff feels like I'm smearing liquid saran wrap in my hair and rinses out well."
4245,1,"Great for dry skin!_I use this product for my dry skin and love it!  Makeup goes on pretty smoothly after using - however, if you need to use a lot of foundation (on blemishes especially), it might crack.  You should make sure you rub it in, also, or you might be left with streaks.  This primer does fill in wrinkles, but the skin seems to absorb the product and since you have to rub it in so much, the product seems to actually get rubbed off, so you have to use quite a bit.  These tubes go fast!  They only seem to be getting more expensive, as well - it might be worth it to check out Walmart or Rite Aid before purchasing this product on Amazon.  I used to buy them for $9 before my Rite Aid stopped carrying them!I have tested this product against Neutrogena's primer as well as Arbonne's and Rimmel still wins."
5022,1,LOVE_Started using this religiously after the Holidays and my skin looks better than ever!  I wish I started earlier.  I bought great products to work with the brush and it has done wonders already.
2536,1,Fine._These were fine for the price.  They are a little small but work o.k. Keeping your hair up.  I have long hair but sometimes want short without cutting.  A wig cap is a must.
8035,1,"Is like any other cheap derma roller_This derma roller is not the best however, for the price is good. I bought the 1.0 & 1.5. The I.0 I use for my face is painless it doesn't feel like needles at all. I've used the 1.5 once in my stretch marks & it has gave me an allergic reaction or something my skin is very Itchy were I derma roll but I will continue to derma roll is weird because I use the 1.0 for my face & I have no problem."
9265,1,"nice_This oil keeps my hair smooth and tames the frizz. It's a bit heavy and the applicator pumps out quite a bit so I have to be careful not to use too much or it flattens my hair. The oil has a strong scent, at first but it mellows out after a few minutes and it's not unpleasant."
1591,1,"ibd gel_this is soooo good.  I love this gel.  it have been doing acrylic for years and decided I wanted to see how this works.  I can tell you this.  I don't want to ever go back to acrylic.  this gel make my nails so smooth and I have had my polish on for about a week now and no chips.  with the uv light, bonder, primer I am good to go. the price and package make it even better. I will definitely be purchasing this in the future"
6474,1,"My Face Feels Fresh!_These exfoliating wipes seem to do double-duty by removing dead skin and oils -- and then closing up the pores with a toner.  My face feels fresh afterward.  Yes, the wipes are textured, giving them a little roughness for exfoliation, but it's not nearly as rough as a facial scrub.  Use them gently but firmly.  The wipes don't contain any perfume, and, as the label says, no animals were used in the testing of the product.  All is good in the world of facial care!-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
8055,1,"Wow! This Product is Amazing!  What a Difference it Made for My Wife's Hair!_I am an Amazon.com Vine Program reviewer and am offered two books or products twice a month in exchange for an honest review.  This month I saw some products that my wife might benefit from.  She asked me to order this one for her.  I did so with the promise that she would write the review.  This is her review:'I suffer from what I call 'Thyroid Hair' which means that I have thin, fine, dry, flat hair.  I was fortunate to get the Patene Expert Collection Age Defy Shampoo from Vine.  It has now been 10 days of daily shampoos and I can honestly say that my hair is less dry, smoother, and fuller than in the past.The shampoo is thick, rich and has a subtle fragrance which lathers into an emollient rich expensive salon type shampoo and it cost about $8 for 30 ml.  This is a great buy. In fact I have decreased the amount that I use since it produces so much lather.  My hair get much drier in the winter months and I am a daily user of the blow dryer and curling iron,  but this product has left my hair less dry or brittle looking, fuller and more shiny than it has ever been. The results are visible not only to me but to family and coworkers who have noticed the difference from flat to full and dull to shiny. I am so pleased that I will also be purchasing the conditioner that is recommended.  Thanks Pantene.'I can tell you first hand that my wife's hair looks so much nicer and really smells even better since she started using this product.Although this product was free in exchange for this honest review, we will reorder it when this one gets low.Enjoy!"
9221,1,Great product!_This is a must if your going to use the CND- Vinylux polish. I looked everywhere for the base coat and never found one then when I saw my manicurist she told me you only need 2 coats of the polish on dry nails and this top coat. It's super fast and keeps my polish on for up to 10 days.
6039,1,"Does what it should_I like this.  It is a mess, and you need the right mascara for it to work well.  I mean, it's not perfect, but it performed as expected"
7424,1,I like it_This shampoo has a nice scent and leaves my hair feeling very soft and smooth.I didn't find the scent to be too strong at all. The price is comparable to other brands so I will probable buy this again (although I don't recommend buying through the mail).
3795,1,miracle in a tiny jar!_I really wish they had this in a larger quantity.  This stuff is amazing. It leaves your face looking clean and youthfulwhile filling in pores and fine lines like it says. I actually bought this thinking it was something else but I'm glad I did. I will keep buying it again and again.
5865,1,Great designs_Great designs. Some were scratched but I was able to get a refund.  They work well thus far and have many different designs and are fun to use. Take some practice and stamping polish.
6269,0,"Stinks. Makes your hair crunchy & brittle!_I was all excited to try this product because I love the hair masque so much. The reviews were great so I gave it a go. What a waste. My curls were crunchy, brittle, and yucky. Never again.For great curls try Batia & Aleeza Mineral Gel. Amazing stuff. And lasts a lifetime."
7150,1,"Working Wonders For Me!_I am biracial, African American/Caucasian. I have dark spots on my face from sun damage and acne scarring. I have tried MANY very expensive products and some prescriptions as well.  This has worked better than anything I have ever tried - I have been using this serum for only a week and have had significant improvement!  I am hopeful that with further use my skin will improve even more."
2685,1,"Lovely skin lotion_I really enjoy this product in the warmer weather. It is lighter than most lotions, but still leaves my skin silky and smooth. I buy it every summer because I like it so much."
2863,1,"Good Product, Regrettable Pricing_There are obviously questions as to whether this product is necessary or just another unnecessary expense/step to the regimen, I'll let other people debate that. I like the product myself, I give it 5 out of 5. Tip: Try this product for a few days, and if after you apply it to a cotton ball, you don't notice the oil and dirt from your face onto the cotton ball, then it wouldn't be relevant to you, however, if you do notice that the product extracted oil and dirt from your face even after washing your face, then the product may have some value. I regret not buying more of this stuff when it was cheaper here on Amazon. I purchased a 6oz bottle of this product (which is noticeably larger when compared to the 4oz bottle) for about $12.50, had I known that the product was going to sell out, I would have purchased more of it as opposed to paying a similar, but more costly price of $9.99 for a 4oz bottle (in terms of ounces). Once again, 5 out of 5 for the product, I just should have stocked up and bought the 6oz instead of the 4oz for the inexpensive price."
6310,1,gems galore_I received these faster than I anticipated and I love the little thing they are in. very easy to open and with out a mess spilling every where. how ever there is one set back in the picture it shows them to be equal in size and they are not. the silver gems container is much small with less gems inside.
8003,1,"Works well_I had been using the Beauty Blender and really liked the flawless finish that I got with it, but needed a new one and didn't want to spend the $$$ on another one. So I went looking for a dupe. This 4 pack of the Bundle Monster is much less expensive ... 4 for $10 ($2.50 each) instead of $20 for a Beauty Blender. There are pros and cons, but overall, I like the finish just as much as the Beauty Blender, and think it's worth it for the price.PROS:(1) Creates a nice flawless finish(2) more durable, lasts longer(3) less expensiveCONS:(1) not as soft, so feels firmer/more pressure on skinAlthough the Bundle Monster sponges are firmer, I am actually ok with that. I like the pointy tip on the Bundle Monster sponges better for contouring around my eyes and nose, and once I got used to the firmer density I forgot about it. I think you just get used to something after a while, and after using the Bundle Monster sponge for a few weeks I went back and tried my old Beauty Blender and it almost felt too squishy/flimsy. I think the finish created by both are very close to the same, with the Bundle Monster giving slightly more coverage, whereas the Beauty Blender applied a little bit more sheer. I have some red spots to cover, so I actually like the slightly heavier coverage given by the Bundle Monster sponges. Still looks airbrushed and soft. And the Bundle Monster sponges are definitely more durable, as I have been using mine everyday for several weeks and they still look almost new. So that's good. And the price can't be beat. I bought a backup pack of 4 with free shipping from amazon, and I think I am officially set now for pretty much...... ever. ;)So if you don't mind a firmer sponge, these work really well and will last a long time. Maybe give yourself 2 weeks to get used to the increased firmness, and I think you'll like them. I do. And I don't foresee myself ever spending $20 on one sponge ever again. You live and you learn. :)"
2562,1,"LOVE IT._Very vibrant colors, highly recommend with a eye shadow primer like MAC, worth every it for its great price.  Love the neutral colors."
3998,0,"Mally Mascara_The first time I purchased this mascara it worked wonderful, it made my lashes long and voluminous, so I repurchased this mascara again, excpet this time I did not like it. The tube was very dry! I think the mascara was old."
9648,1,"Insta Natural Products are really nice!_I really like this product, a little goes a long way.  I have really dry skin and my hair is really dry.  I used this on wet hair.  The first time I used to much, its trial and error like any product.  The 2nd time I used the right amount.  I also put it on dry hair and I massage into my scalp whenever it feels dry and itchy and I don't have dandruff, just over 50 and very dry skin. The oil is thin, not thick, but it does pack a lot of oil in a couple little drops.  I'm used to using Chi's keratin silk oil and its thick and I can use a lot of that and not have too much.  So this product was a nice surprise of how little you need. I also have been using it on my nails and cuticles and my nails aren't chipping like they had been.  Stopped peeling too.  I use their Vitamin C serum and the Rosehip Serum and love those too.  Quality products!"
4381,1,"LOVE THIS NUDE LINER_Perfect for any nude look, has great pigment and is very soft without tugging on your lips..Pretty good price also!"
8892,1,"Perfect color, coverage and condition_The first time I tried this I didn't like it as it left my hair sticky.  However, if I wash the coloring out with a little shampoo before putting the conditioner on it was perfect.  It didn't effect the color doing this.  I had been hooked on Herbishine and thought I would not find a good replacement as it had been discontinued.  This product is wonderful and I will continue ordering it."
3693,0,"OKAY..._This eyeliner is okay.I would not recommend it, though. I constantly find myself dipping and dipping the felt tip back in the bottle, and in the end,it looks very messy.Get the E.L.F liquid liner instead for only $1!!! This eyeliner is a RIP OFF"
7552,1,Great Color_I ordered this so I would have a basic white to use as a base for some very colorful glitter nail polish.  Love it.
9375,1,"a little awkward packaging but makes skin smoother_This product packaging and description confused me a little bit.The photo on the box shows such contiguous facial coverage that I thought there was a small fold out mask inside.This prompted me to open the side in a long slit.Much to my surprise, this is just a mud like substance that you need to squeeze out and rub on your face.The heating element, is automatically activated while you rub. (kind of like Ben Gay, but not as strong, and dissipates quickly)Also, it very difficult to achieve coverage similar to the photo on the box, and ends up being a little more smeared overall.However, the effect is pleasant.  Apply, wait a minute or 2 and then jump in the shower and it rinses clean.The after effect seems to leave smooth and refreshed skin.I think if you looking for a more &#34;tightening&#34; effect, you might stick with a more hard packed cream solution.  Otherwise, this is a nice little pick me up, especially on the go or the road."
2763,1,"BEST THERE IS!_Best product for cleansing sensitive skin.  Don't use anything else.  None irritating, none drying for sensitive skin.  I am 74 and have people stop me to tell me how good my skin looks...people I don't even know (sometimes I think they might need glasses) but will take any complement I can get!"
7810,1,Yay_These makeup brushes are really good quality and I love the color of them.  The case is pretty good too!
9388,1,"No miracle, but what a difference!_I have aging, sun damaged, combination skin.  I'm especially concerned with how dry the skin around my eyes seems to be and the accompanying crows feet.  I've tried a LOT of products, from drugstore, to department store, to mail order.  I was given the Day by Day Vitamin C Serum in exchange for an honest review and figured I had nothing to lose by trying it.The serum is very thin, almost watery.  It comes in a pump bottle, and you only need about half a pump for your entire face.  I learned to pump it directly onto my forehead and spread from there, otherwise it runs all over my hand.I've been using the serum for almost a week.  I use it at night after washing my face and exfoliating every other day.  It's my first layer, before a couple of night creams, one containing hyaluronic acid.  The only part of my routine that's changed is the underlayer of the Day by Day Vitamin C Serum.Holy Smokes!  After a couple of days, I noticed that my skin felt better in the morning.  It's softer, and feels moisturized.  That's different--usually my skin feels dry in the morning, sometimes with a greasy coating of stuff that my skin didn't absorb.  The serum seems to help the other creams fully penetrate my skin.  After five days, my skin looks great.  The BB cream that I use instead of foundation is going on more evenly, and I don't need as much.The ultimate was a lady at church last Sunday morning who peered at me and said, 'How OLD are you?  You don't have any wrinkles around your eyes!'That was probably a function of lighting and angle, because of course I rushed home, peered at myself in the bathroom mirror, and found lots of wrinkles, but I will say that compliments on my skin from comparative strangers have never happened before.  Coincidence?I don't hold out much hope for long term wrinkle eradication, though that would be nice.  Miracles can happen, but I'll settle for a serum that both works and seems to make everything else work better.  For the price, this is great stuff!"
9126,1,Great product_Great blackhead remover I noticed a difference after the first use left my face felling refreashed has a wonderful scent
5311,1,"4/5_I really liked the cleanser. I don't know how hard these other users are scrubbing their faces, but it seemed gentle enough for me. It also has a nice, apple scent coming out of it.The cleanser, however, tends to use more water to cleanse your face."
108,1,"Zapzyt_This stuff helps me with my zits.  It works !And there's more in the tube than the moreexpensive stuff,  and it's the same thing !I recommend it."
9347,1,"My first experience with a Vitamin C serum_I followed the directions clearly posted on this product page within the product description. I appreciate the fact that I only have to allow this serum to dry on my skin for five minutes--versus twenty minutes for other wrinkle-prevention products I've experimented with--before applying a moisturizer on top of it. I don't have brown spots, uneven skin tone, large pores, rough or dry skin, so I can't attest to its effects on improving those issues. However, I'm old enough to have started the wrinkling process, and I can speak to that.In the immediate moment of applying the serum and for a little while afterwards, I found that it gave a sensation of light flushing and tightening of my skin, and I had a pleasant tingling sensation. I really wanted to use the serum around the eyes--one of the first and heaviest areas for skin to age--but I couldn't find a way to ensure none of it would get rubbed into my eyes.I can't personally report any amazingly noticeable difference in eliminating my existing wrinkles while using this product, but I also did not notice my skin getting worse, and at my age, no new, bad news translates to good news.This product has great ingredients, which the manufacturer has accurately and completely listed here on this product page--which far too few companies bother to do for their cosmetics. This serum is also made in the USA, which means you don't have to fear potentially dangerous Chinese ingredients. Best of all, the price is amazing. This one bottle, used as directed, will last me about four months. That's unimaginably cheap for a skincare product for aging skin.Honestly speaking, though, the best prevention I've ever found for skin aging is bioidentical, pharmaceutical-grade progesterone such asProgestelle Progesterone Oil. Nothing else compares for that purpose, in my own personal experience, and the progesterone has the added advantage of protecting one from cancer and strengthening the bones. However, I only use it 21 days of the month, so I will probably keep using this product as well.Distilled Water, Glycerin, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Hyaluronic Acid, Ferulic Acid, Phloretin (Apple Tree Leaves Extracts), Pomegranate Seed (Punica Granatum) Oil, Tocotrienols (Vitamin E), Vitamin E Oil (Alpha-D-Tocopherol), Astaxanthin (Yellow Leaves Extracts), Lycopene (Red Fruits Extracts), Lutein (Green Leafy Vegetables Extracts), Alpha Lipoic Acid, Beta Carotene (Carrot Extract), Xanthan Gum, Citrus Essential Oils, Phenoxyethanol (Sun Protection), Caprylyl Glycol (Plant Extract), Sorbic Acid.DISCLOSURE: I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer in order to test it so that I could write a review detailing my experiences with it. I have no association with the company, and I've never been paid for any review of any product in my life. Reviewing books and products on Amazon is a hobby for me."
7984,1,"love this, so glad I bumped into it here on amazon_I use this for my T zone on my face. it has made that part of my face dry and soft, no more oily skin. love it.In the beginning I used it all over my face and noticed that it was over drying the parts of my face that aren't very oily. now the way I'm using it is perfect."
274,1,"Pretty Nails Instalnt Polish Remover Regular_This item is as described.  It removes nail polish quickly, easily, and completely.  I highly recommend this instant polish remover."
6699,1,"LOVE this product_I have long curly caucasian hair that tangles easily and gets matted. I use a sulfate free wash and comb my hair out in the shower, I then rinse and apply AS I AM and comb it through; I allow this product to sit in my hair for a while, as I shave my legs, and then rinse it out. This leaves my hair smelling and feeling great. I comb my hair out of the shower and apply CHI silk treatment. My hair is light weight, silky, and frizz/ flyaway free. This product is a must have."
3530,1,"LOVE LOVE LOVE_My hair is curly frizzy and thick, and when straightening it would last for a while but then get all frizzy again and dry. I use this product after washing my hair along with ApHogee Keratin and Green Tea Restructurizer on my damp hair them straighten it and my hair feels so soft. Tia a great product and I love it"
9107,1,cleared up my skin - love it_love this product! I use it several times a week to help thoroughly remove my makeup and have noticed my skin cleared up a lot. will continue to use.
3161,1,"autumnal bliss_This perfume is a gorgeous combo of mulled wine, tropical tuberose, and incense. I find it perfect for autumn or winter. It's sexy, but accesible. Plus its so cheap online."
9081,1,"Good quality for the price_Due to the amazing reviews these brushes got, I ordered them. For the price they are good quality brushes, but they can't compare to the quality of Sigma brushes and other Kabuki brushes I own. My complain is that they could be more soft and flexible on the skin, but nevertheless you can't go wrong with this set. For the price they are a great buy!"
5925,1,Great!_I have been using it for about a month now and I will say I love it.... I have combo skin.... And I am 38...never thought I would put oil on my face... But I actually look forward to it! It does make my skin look nice.... And its has seemed to cut any breakouts down to nothing.  Very impressive I will repurchase.
7448,1,Amazing!_I have to say this stuff is truly amazing. I figured this was just another conditioner and I have used them all. Not so. We had recently been to the Blue Lagoon in Iceland. The ends of my color treated hair were like straw ever since. The minerals in the water just sucked right into my hair and it was nasty. For the last week I had been using all kinds of conditioners to try to get this resolved. Last night I used this product that came yesterday and VOILA! My hair is soft again and the ends are healed. I would not have believed it if it hadn't happened to me.The container opens from the bottom which is nice because you don't have to wait for the conditioner to run down. My only caution to you is make sure you have it snapped shut tightly otherwise it leaks out.
4917,1,Hey naturals great brush for 4c hair._Great brush to use against my natural hair love it.  You can even modify it if you feel there are to many pins for your hair.  Will purchase this again.
1415,1,Very good_This treatment works very well. Not oily on the skin. Regular user and repeat buyer. So it's good for us.
3391,1,Gentle exfoliation_This exfoliates but is still gentle compared to rougher pads I have used. My face feels smooth and clean after using it. It is also thicker/more padded than similar pads I have bought.
7503,1,good product_It works better than edge control doesn't leave any white residue after using it. It is a little greasy but it serves its purpose
9233,1,"Pretty Good._This moisturizer did make my skin softer. I found it lessened the dry skin around my eyes and did not make me break out.However, I have not seen any anti-wrinkling effects yet. I suppose keeping the skin hydrated will, in time, ease the effects of aging.I like the bottle and the presentation. The solution feels very fresh and inviting, not greasy like some moisturizers can be. It feels rather luxurious, like a treat, to put it on at night. There is no overwhelming perfume or otherwise smell to it, which is good because you would smell it all night! The price is pretty reasonable for this sort or product with a brand name. The amount you receive is tolerable and should last for at least a month or two depending on how much you use.I'd recommend someone looking for a product like this, to try it out. It's inexpensive enough to try and not suffer buyer's remorse if you don't like it. I would think, if you don't like it, it would be because it's too light and not from any adverse effects."
3054,1,"NO Doubt Now_At first doubt reigned supreme; however, after a few uses I found this device just perfect for my family's needs.  It is more than a straightener.  It can make your hair wavy and curly with a few additional strokes and that is a neat little trick.  Then when you add avocado to the mix and the shine you get, that is the deal maker for me.  I initially thought, What? but was pleasantly surprised to find that the shine worked and the avocado added a nice tad of aroma.I agree with one reviewer who thought the edges could be a bit better honed and presented; however, that did not take anything away for me.  Placement of the buttons are O.K. but I can see where they could be a problem for some folks.Bottom Line:  Well worth the price especially when compared to some in the plus $100 range.  Even my hairdresser likes this product.  If, of course, you do not want straight or wavy hair, then this is probably not for you.  Ours has found a permanent placement in the hair processing room (that's D.C. talk for bathroom) for its instant use."
1472,1,"Beautiful incredible salon quality products_I am blown away by the John Frieda collection. I just started using their shampoo/conditioner/leave-in spray and nourishing lotion, plus the glaze for brunettes and their precision hair color and my hair looks and feels better than it has in a long while. The products do just what they say. I give them all 5 stars... Glaze is perfect alone or compliment to the precision hair color, easy to do alone and 100% gray coverage and gorgeous color."
5955,1,"Love the ROLLER BALL version_Vitamin C is known for its firming and brightening abilities.  it is also touted to prevent antioxident damage from the sun.  Unfortunately, most Vitamin C products cannot penetrate into the dermis efficiently to be effective.  Many are very irritating to my sensitive skin and if used too often burn and irritate.  I do like to incorporate vitamin C skincare into my regimen, but NOT daily.  I especially like it around the under eye area for its brightening ability.  I tried this product and like it.  I especially like the ROLLER BALL version.  I keep it stored tightly in my fridge and use it a few times a week - a cool boost of Vitamin C on the eyes is great.  The roller balls gentle massage effect helps the product penetrate into the skin.  Again, I can't use this daily because the Vitamin C irritates my sensitive skin but if used a few times a week, it is a great 'boost' to my skin care regimen."
2046,1,"Amazing stuff!_I recently got two bottles of this from my cousin who was in the hospital. She gave it to me because she said she wouldn't use it. Let me say that this stuff is amazing and a life saver. I love it! I had a horrid yeast infection and this is the only soap product I could use down there, without burning and stinging. It's also great for mid day freshen ups. I use it in the shower daily as well. It has a nice foam to it and rinses away very clean. I know it is a no rinse product, which I have used it as that too and had no problems."
7169,1,"SMELLS AMAZING_THIS HAIR CREAM SMELLS GREAT BUT IT IS VERY THICK.  IT HAS A PASTEY OR TACKY FEEL TO IT SO ONLY APPLY A DIME SIZED AMOUNT. OVERALL, GOOD PRODUCT."
5811,0,"Cheap And Very Little Color And Sparkel_This stuff looks like something from a kids playset. I expected some bold bright color and, tons of sparkle...What you actually get is some sheer shine and, little sparkle and, the shadow is very watery. Don't waste your hard earned cash on this."
5107,1,"Cute package, Great product._I bought this product because the packaging is adorable, but it smells great and works very well. I will definitely order this again in the future."
7435,1,"I think there's a conditioner in this shampoo_It's not marketed as including conditioners, but my hair feels like it does after using a conditioner.  So if you have fine, thin hair, you may not want to use this, as conditioners will weigh your hair down.I like it.  A little bit gives a lot of lather.  The scent is clean and pleasant, not perfumey.  It's too early to tell if it will really strengthen my hair.  I'm doubtful, because I'm older (67) and my hair has been thinning for years.I don't see that my results are much different from my regular shampoo (Pantene), but I'll probably switch.  It does make more lather than Pantene, so I'll be able to use less, and I like the light conditioning.  The ingredients list several natural oils, so maybe that's where the conditioning comes from.Five stars because it lathers nicely, rinses clean, and smells good.  There's not much more to ask from a shampoo."
7451,1,"Basic Conditioner_Despite the description, this is a pretty average conditioner. It is thick but goes a long way as you don't need to use a lot of product to condition your hair. It left my hair soft, shiny, and clean but a lot of conditioners do that. I liked the scent, but the packaging is less than stellar. It opens at the bottom and it leaked on the shower floor."
1535,0,"FYI: Contains formaldehyde_It was hard to find the ingredients, but for those who have had bad reactions to other nail products with formalin/formaldehyde/tolulene, here are the Rejuvacote ingredients:Ethyl Acetate, butyl acetate, nitrocellulose, toluenesulfonamide/formaldehyde resin, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, trymethyl penthanyl, dissobutyrate, camphor, hydrolized wheat protein, hydrolyzed keratin, hydrolized soy protein, calcium pantothenate.Update: if you test this first and use only every 2-3 weeks, shouldn't be a big problem. I play guitar and my thin nails take a beating, so I've tried several products. They should have listed the ingredients."
6054,0,"Horrible hair breakage_I have thick coily 3/4 AA hair. When I first tried this stuff it caused me to experience breakage that took me 4 or so months to overcome. I used it as a leave in. I believe it is the proteins in the conditioner.It retails $9.99 at Target or similar stores. I returned it after my horrible experience, and because of that I will never try any other green SM product again."
5263,1,Sheer Organzation_I love all the colors iside this train case that will last for years to come. You could customize the case to your personality. There are so many make up colors to choose from and combintaions it is endless on what you could create. Great for a teen or make up lover.
1319,0,"Yuck!_I brought this based on all the other reviews. I returned it. I hated the taste of this product. It also did not work on my lips and dried them out. I do love the fact that there wernt any harsh chemicals in this product, but I need a lip balm that has medication for healing in it. I switched to aquaphor instead. I guess it would be good if you just wanted something to put on your lips, but I live in a cold environment, where I need a lip protectant/healing oinment."
6454,1,"Straight and Soft!_I love this Keratin Infusion product line. As a African American women, I wasn't sure about this product but since I had a coupon I decided to give it a try. Well, it works. I use it for my daughter's hair as well as my own. It makes our hair soft, smooth and detangles well. The price is excellent as well."
5743,1,This is a great blush brush!_I purchased this entire brush line because I adore the Pixiwoo sisters and wanted to try Sam's signature brush line. I really like this brush! The tapered end makes it easy to define the contour of the cheekbone as well as apply blush to the apples of the cheeks. It is very soft and the product goes on smoothly and evenly.
9641,1,"Fabulous!_I have extremely *dry* hair and skin. Winter is nemesis, and summer isn't really much better. To make matters worse, it also tends to be quite sensitive to many things I try to moisturize with, so I have to be careful.This Argan oil has been fantastic. It doesn't take very much at all, and it moisturizes without any greasy feel. It doesn't burn like many things do (especially on my face). I occasionally use it on my hair as well, to help smooth and control frizz. A little goes a VERY long way, so this bottle should last just about everyone quite a while.*NOTE* - I was provided this bottle of Argan oil in exchange for an honest review. &#34;Honest&#34; being the key word - if I didn't like it, the above review would say so. It doesn't - so I did :)"
5818,1,"Amazing smell_If you've never tried any Pacificia products, you're in for a treat. They all smell delicious! The scent, Island Vanilla, is vanilla mixed with other scents for a fragrance that's not as sweet as cupcakes but a more mature vanilla scent.The shower gel rinses clean leaving no residue. It's also vegan and sulfate-free so it doesn't dry out skin. Definitely recommend!"
8853,1,"I Love This Product!_I am not able to use too many nail products as I am sensitive to many chemicals.  I saw this at CVS recently and decided to try it.  For the first time in probably 10 years, I actually look like I have a nice manicure.  I type 10 hours sometimes more a day.  I have had this on my nails for 4 days now.  It has not chipped and with the slight pink tint, my nails look healthy.  I will purchase it again.  The only negative is that it does have a strong smell."
599,0,I don't know.._Not sure if I noticed in my bowl movements. Not sure how I feel about the product. Might work for others but not for me and that's ok.
5031,1,"great tool_Love it.  Hard core top of pores soften and then are gone after a few days.  Then because that hard core is gone, the cleaning can begin.  After the cleaning is kept up for a while, the pores get smaller, and smaller.  This is coming from a 53 year old woman who has had hard cored, large pores all of her life.  Now I have a soft face, and I am so happy.  Something simple like that can make a woman feel sooooo good.  Plus a clean face shows the wrinkles less, or a dirty face shows the wrinkles a lot more.  Younger looking and soft skin.  Win Win"
6066,1,Works great!_I'm 38 and have pretty clear skin but have small breakouts everynow and then. I've been using the scrub for 3 weeks now and it really does clear up blemishes overnight. I use it daily and whenever a blemish shows up during the day it's usually gone by the next morning.My skin is left feeling very soft. The scrub has exfoliating beads in it but the scrub is so creamy that the beads don't feel too harsh and it washes off cleanly. I will definitely be purchasing this product when my current supply runs out.I highly recommend this scrub if you are prone to frequeny break outs.
3881,1,"Great hold. Awesome smell!_This is my favorite hairspray and I have been using it for years.  It's a harder hairspray, so I wouldn't recommend it if you like to comb through your hair afterwards.  But having said that there is still some flexibility. It also smells wonderful!"
7966,1,"Love it!_Bare Escentuals is a great make up. It glides on easily and lasts all day.  I am 63 and have used this make up for at least 10 years.  No oil or shine, and I always get compliments about how smooth my skin looks."
6252,1,SEXY_This wig defenitly looks realistic and I love it i don't believe that anyone knows it is a wig since i wear it every day. Never the less Im in love.
2151,1,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this moisturizer_I love this stuff! It's not greasy and it makes my skin soo soft. I used it all summer long and never had a skin problem. I used in conjunction with the ambi even tone face bar and my skin is smooth and even toned. The scent is light and not overpowering at all. Considering the bottle is small, it does last a long time and a dime size drop is enough for your whole face and neck. HIGHLY recommend!"
9296,1,Great colors_The formula is nice - goes on smoothly and is opaque with one thick or 2 thin coats. Love Essie's products.
670,1,Good Stuff_I love this stuff.  I've never used it before now but I'm using it every day to ease the dryness of my skin.  I also dab a little on my hair ends as a moisturizer and to keep my hair from being so unruly. It's in a solid form and takes a little warming up in order to spread it around.
2398,1,"The search for shampoo and conditioner is over!_I have tried just about everything and I love, love, love this stuff. My hair is so healthy and soft as a result of using this shampoo and conditioner. The search is over -- thank goodness!"
5820,1,"Wen? Now!_At first I was skeptical regarding these products and yes you must follow the directions or you will have problems, these products have been Heaven sent for my hair which is very thick and unruly. I noticed some difference right away but I think using the products consistently over a period of time I have been able to truly see the distinction. Again, this is just a product and no after simply washing and drying your hair will not look like the STYLED BY PROFESSIONALS MODELS in the videos for Wen (hard to believe some actually expect that?) but I have dramatically improved texture, manageability, shine and appearance. I have tried so many products due to my hair's challenges, Wen is the best by far. I experimented with some formulas and still keep several but Pomegranate has been the best for my hair type so far. I am also happy it is offered here as no matter how great the product I do NOT participate in clubs such as the Wen site has, I have had too many bad experiences with those Clubs. Again, try it and stay with it, I can really notice the changes now after extended use, all for the GOOD."
83,0,"Had to stop using_I will admit -- I do feel this product was helping reduce my acne. However, I developed a really nasty yeast infection about two weeks in (sorry to be gross but want to give an honest review) and I also noticed a weird stinging sensation in my lower abdomen. I did some online searching and noticed some people say they develop gastro issues with this product. I didn't add anything else new to my routine and haven't had a yeast infection in years. May be totally un-related but once I stopped the product, my stomach issues stopped. I think this is a good product, but for me, the side effects were not worth it."
8366,0,"Faulty, overpriced_This mirror is ridiculously overpriced. We had one for almost 4 years and it didn't even cost half of this price. And it worked a lot better! You have to actually pour water in the little reservoir in back of the actual mirror for it to stay defogged. It's a real pain especially since half the time I'm still having to wipe my hand over it to clear it up. The light is pointless. You have to press really hard on the button for it to work, and I don't actually see a purpose to it, as it doesn't make much of a difference as to what you're seeing. The razor holders are a joke. I nearly tore the whole mirror off the wall trying to yank one of my razors out. You have to be super gentle or the front of the mirror will come off (which it does anyway because it takes almost no effort to loosen it).I am not impressed with this at all and do not recommend it."
2463,1,"crazy good_This stuff is amazing. I use to use the clarisonic mia everyday, a wash cloth at night to remove make up, plus peter thomas Roth aha/bha clearing gel. All of them combine don't work as effectively as this stuff. From the first use I have had glowing smooth skin and I have not had a single pimple since I started using it. Plus I have stopped using the clearing gel and mia. I do use this way more then I should, sometimes everyday, or every other day but my sensitive skin hasn't had a reaction so I figure its fine. I use it and so does my husband and both of us find this way more effective then our clarisonics. I highly suggest buying this in place of a clarisonic. The amount of white balls is always amazing, there hasn't been any decrease in them which seems odd since I use this so frequently. Our pores are smaller and, our skin glows, it really does. I use jasmine water Bb cream for foundation and my skin looks better now then it did in my 20's. Please try it. The people who gave this bad reviews must already use something that keeps their skin smooth cause the results are so dramatic I don't understand how it wouldn't work for everyone. There is nothing in this that should burn, its 90%water, with glycerin and peroxide, and it shouldn't be on you skin longer than a min."
8518,1,"Hubby Loves it, I like the smell_My son and husband like this product a lot.  A big plus is the 2+1 feature which my son asks for - why?  It's much easier when a man has long hair that needs conditioner to just take one bottle to the gym.The leather is super rich.  I had to try it for myself after my husband told me that 'it reminds me of that shaving cream the way it just foams up.'  It does have very rich lather that leaves your hair feeling very clean.The scent is manly, but invigorating so even as a woman I enjoyed it as a change of pace.  It's too masculine a scent for me to use on a regular basis though."
3015,1,LOVE IT!_I've reviewed this product before. I use thiese everyday. I kept hearing about how wonderful this color is and how it's discontinued. I decieded to try it. I like it a lot!
9114,1,They Worked for Me_I bought this Hot Huez hair chalk set for my niece's 6th birthday. They were a big hit.  We had to glue one of the pans of chalk back in it's holder but other than that we didn't have any problem.  Some of the colors were more pigmented than others but they all showed up. They aren't awesome quality but they did what they were designed to do and my niece loved them; so I am happy!  ***I would not recommend these for use on dark hair they probably won't show up!
9676,1,"Even Glow Serum_I recently tried this Even Glow Serum with 20% Vitamin C.  The reason I wanted to try it was to help even my skin tone out more. I had noticed that I was getting a bit of discoloration on one of my cheeks and I had heard so many great things about products with Vitamin C in them.  I also like to use products that have natural ingredients in them and this Even Glow Serum is 98% natural.Along with the Vitamin C this serum includes Organic Rosehip Seed Oil and Organic Sea Buckthorn Oil to hydrate and lock in moisture. Resistem which is plant stem cells that help protect from stress-related aging, promote skin detoxification and helps your skin regenerate faster. Hyaluronic Acid helps penetrate your skin deeply, and actives collagen production for a fresher, younger, firmer, and brighter complexion. The finial natural ingredient is Green Tea Extact which is a potent antioxidant which also contribute to the overall anti-inflammatory and anti-irritant benefits of this ancient health and beauty secret. All of these ingredients work together to make your skin look fantastic.Here is what I like best about this Even Glow Serum from Valentia is how it helps even my skin tone, it increases the glow and makes your skin look radiant. It was so easy to use and it absorbed into my skin rapidly.  I also like that it helps reduce wrinkles, fine lines and also increase collagen so my skin retains elasticity.  I am looking forward to younger looking skin."
3786,1,"Excellent, Creamy Shampoo_You only need a little - this shampoo is so rich. Love the smell. I love that it's sulfate free. It is better than most high-end shampoos I've used. Great product."
6160,1,"Good stuff, getting hard to find_This is quite a nice and effective cream, especially for the price.  I have fair skin and started getting little brown spots on my face, especially around my eyebrows, and the tops of my hands several years ago.  This cream fades the spots completely over about a 3-4 month period if used consistently.  It also refines my skin to a nice texture and am considering using it as a day and night cream on my whole face because of its texture-refining ability.  It seems to be getting harder to find so I was happy to find it here.  I recommend it and intend to keep using it."
4872,1,Awesome_Leaves the hair soft and manageable no build up I have natural hair 3b/4c I use this daily great product!!
2083,1,"Stress Relief_When I get stressed out, I reach for this. Stress can lead to a lot of problems, which is why it needs to be under control. Simply smell this when you feel stressed and it will help to calm you. It smells good, too."
2948,1,High Quality_These brushes are of really high quality and didn't lose hairs when you use them. This brand is really great. They also came with a booklet to tell you what each brush is to be used for. I am very impressed!
6501,1,"Nice_It is a very nice aroma, very light and not overpowering, feels wonderful after a shower mixing with your cream"
1845,1,A good green_I didn't plan to purchase this color but my husband surprised me so I'm game.
6348,0,"Noticed nothing_I noticed no difference in my skin whatsoever. Not better, not worse. So for this price, Id say move on and keep looking."
4591,0,"Nothing great..._I bought this at my sister's recommendation after she had a salesperson show her this in Vegas.  Unfortunately, it was the wrong product...the product she loved in Vegas was Oro (see that product for reviews), which visibly gives you a life instantly.  The Gratiae product line is no better or worse than any other skin care line.  It does not diminish wrinkles.  At least not for me, my sister or my boss.It's a nice moisturizer, but so are the Olay products.I won't buy these again.  As for the Gratiae website and the prices there -- it makes me laugh.  I'm amazed at what people will buy to look younger -- me included.This just does not do what it claims.  Again, other reviewers may not have much experience in other skin regimes -- I'm an addict.  I'll try anything that someone tells me is wonderful.  This is not wonderful.  It's ordinary.Have recently ordered the product (Oro Instant Firming Serum) that made my sister squeal in Vegas,  I will review it - honestly - after I give it a chance.Until then -- save your money!"
9827,1,"Pretty Scent_There are so many uses listed for rose water. I use it for the pretty scent. It's pleasant and light, not weighed down like perfumes. It dries very quickly, so I don't feel any moisturizing effects, but there is a tingle of toning.I only wish the bottle was not open mouth. It would be so much easier to apply if there was a smaller drip spout or spray pump. If it had a spray pump, I could spritz this all over. As it is, I use a cotton ball, but a spout or other dispenser would be much appreciated.This product was provided for review by InstaNatural."
9491,1,Nice formula_Very creamy with a nice consistency.  We just had a horrible week of super cold weather with wind chills below 30 degrees. This moisturizer along with the serum kept my face looking moist and hydrated.
3787,1,"My go to mascara_When it comes to store bought mascara, this is my mascara of choice. Out of all the years I have been wearing makeup this mascara has been the best. I have never had another over the counter mascara create such length and thickness. I cheated on this mascara tonight and bought Lash Blast and I wish I hadn't. I tried to save some money and ended up with a So-so product. I would really like to give this mascara 4 1/2 stars because there are better mascaras."
2111,1,"Amazing hair dryer_This is the same dryer used at my Domincan Hair salon. It has temperature and a timer control. It dries my hair evenly and does not fry my hair and leave in brittle. You need to purchase a hair net to use it, and I would recommend ear coverings. Now I dont have to leave my house to get a fabulous wash and set. Its expensive but it really works well."
8159,1,"Love it!_I was really skeptical about buying a $27 wet to dry flat iron.  I bought it because of all the great reviews on here, and I wasn't disappointed.  It's a matter of debate as to whether it really saves time, but it does dry my hair and makes it much less frizzy that my other ridiculously expensive flat iron.  I love it!  My expensive flat iron has been down graded to the bottom of my appliance drawer!"
865,1,excellent scent_I've been using this cologne for a while and I get alot of compliments on it and for under $20 its really worth it.
1179,1,"best way to apply foundation ever!!_bouncy soft, pliable sponge. blends foundation, sheer application to build coverage. seamless application that blends easily. great for beginners and pros. forces you to wet and wash a little with every use (which is a good thing) good for dry skin because it does not exfoliate like brushes and pull up dry skin. pointed tip gets in perfectly under eyes to blend foundation and concealer. love the color too; very hot pink. worth buying the REAL beauty blender."
9673,1,"Incredible Skin Care in a Pill Form_Wow, this is the first time I have taken a pill for anti aging.  I have always used moisturizers and gels and creams, so when I found out about this product, I wanted to try it.  I am so happy with the results so far.  My skin looks so refreshed and hydrated.  I feel like I look younger! These pill work from the inside giving you really nice fresh looking skin. If you are looking for an anti aging product, this is the one to buy."
2937,1,"Good for an over all  moisturizer_I dont think it does miracle, and evening out the skin tone depend on how much pigmentation issues you have, Over all it is a good moisturizer but I think there is too much hype over Nia 24. I use it as day cream. I may buy it next time or try another cream so I gave this a 4 star."
8740,1,"Love!_I am a former Creme de la mer user and have heard great things about Nivea from Germany(mine was from Germany). It's comparable to Creme and I love the thickness and scent. It might be too heavy for people with oily skin, but I have combination skin and it has worked great. I feel like my skin is glowing after I apply it and I plan on purchasing more."
337,1,"Small, but really good quality._These are smaller than I expected, but they were able to keep my thick curly hair up. Plus there are so many of them. It's a great price and the actual clips are really sturdy."
3208,1,Additional machine_My wife loved the shellac process we bought an additional dryer so my daughter would not have to transport hers from her house to ours
702,1,"Love! Love! A staple for me!_This moisturiser is great.  I love it!I especially like how the glycerin in there moisturises my afro new growth as I am stretching my relaxer (15th week).Also, I like that when I use it, I do not have to use setting lotion for my roller sets.I had to experiment with it to see how much to use on my fine hair so that it is not weighed down.This is a staple for me!"
7116,1,"Saw Improvement in 2days!!!!_I love this product, I use 2 swipes of Rapid Brow during the day since I work at a senior home. This product does leave a shine or greasy residue.  I am a African American female with bad eyebrow length and shape! I now see hair growing out of places I didnt see before. I am really happy with this product. It should last 6months. I will purchase again"
8877,1,"I love this blow dryer!_Wow. My hair is long and thick (past my shoulder blades) and has two-toned highlights allover.  I dread washing my hair because it takes so long to dry and then is frizzy and needs to be straightened or heat styled in some manner before I feel like I can even walk out of the house.  This blow dryer seems to mostly dry my hair in about ten minutes, and fully dried in fifteen to twenty minutes, depending on the weather.  AND...it is very silky and smooth (not 100% like a flat iron) and I can pull it back in a clip and leave, if I really don't want to style.  That's without me playing with a round brush or attempting to style while I dry.  It has made my hair drying experience exponentially better.  Cold shot button, three heat settings, two fan settings.  Just the best blow dryer I've ever had, in my 30+ years of hair styling.  Only thing that might be a con:  It's a little heavier than my previous couple.  But since it only takes me ten minutes to dry my hair, I don't mind!  It feels very solid and sturdy.  I'll update if anything changes!Pros:Cold shot buttonthree heat settingstwo fan settingsattractive black stylingloop for hangingCon:A little on the heavy side, but I wouldn't change this to make it less powerful"
8144,1,"Maybe I'm Born With It, No I Just Love Maybelline_Item: Color Sensational High Shine GlossBrand: MaybellineI love this product, not because of how it feels, but because of the colors. It goes on easy, but it is a little sticky. The color selection is amazing and great for a fashionista who likes to shake it up."
9381,0,Undersized_I realize I have a larger than normal head but this shower cap is ridiculously small for me and I doubt it would fit well on many adults.  That said it is a cute cap but at $10 a bit overpriced even if it fit well.  Free sample provided for review.
5419,1,Really Works_I love this product it is not super expensive but makes my hair look great and expensive.  A great buy
2312,1,"Ahh that Revlon Colorstay!_Sheer, beautiful, perfect, stays, slightly shiney without the gloss, even pretty as a blush and eyeshaddow...buy it..you'll wear it most days."
4673,1,"Works great!_Works great, I do have to use a lot since my hair is pretty long. If you rub between your hands and get it warm, it does apply easier.  Also, I love Moroccanoil products for their smell. One challenge is that it is difficult to see where you have already applied, I tend to miss a few spots."
3810,1,"It's good_I expected it would arrive in brown colour, but then I read colours may vary, so I got it in black colour. Guess what? black is even better when you come think of it. I love it and it holds my hair up perfectly."
1574,0,"No Change_I used the entire jar and see no change. It also doesn't seem to moisturize very effectively. I do have sensitive skin and I did not react to this product, so in terms of that feature, it was fine."
3560,0,"Can't believe anyone could use this_I bought some in desperation because they had it at the grocery store and I was on vacation and forgot my hand lotion. I used it once and threw it out...it absolutely reeks. I can't imagine anyone wanting to use this and smell like it. Seriously, it's repellent. Weleda Skin food is SOOOO much better and smells wonderful. I wouldn't use this one unless you have no sense of smell and want to repel people."
3846,1,"Ohhhh yes!_This is an amazing *little* blush. The pigment is wonderful and goes on so smoothly and blends beautifully. I found I could put a little swipe of color or build it up for a more intense flush. I was worried about ordering a blush online, as the screen display is almost always different than the true color. In this case, it worked out and was a terrific buy.I have a new favorite!"
4748,1,"Just ordered another!_This has been hair changing for me!  I have colored hair and highlights and have bee growing out some major bleaching damage which I have been consistently trimming but I didn't want to have to cut half my hair off since it's only shoulder length.  I have used this about 3 to 4 times and my hair now looks healthy and shiny, my split ends not even visible!  I wash my hair every 3 days because it is dry and the night before put a quarter's worth in and comb through and when I wash the next morning, I see an immediate difference.  Will not be without this product and will cut back as my hair improves to maybe once a week or as needed.  This is truly amazing and I have tried a ton of products but this one made the real difference."
1195,1,Sponges are great!_This is a great deal! I have never bought the sponges by themselves because they are too expensive. But with is deal you get two practically for the price of one plus the cleanser! Highly recommend the sponges work incredibly well. Best way to put on foundation.
3112,1,"better than I thought_I'm hair styling impaired but I saw Phillip B on another program, demonstrating how to use this product.  Amazon was cheaper - YAY AMAZON!Mine came without the clear cover but it's fine otherwise.You have to make sure you shake it up before each use.  Phillip's  model (with flat, dry hair) flipped her head over and he spritzed the Maui Wowie on the roots.  He let it dry (10 - 15 seconds) and flipped the hair back.  He  styled the hair with his fingers - no brush or comb - I think they would defeat the purpose of more volume.  The lady had shorter, layered hair, much like mine.  I don't know how it would work on long hair.I was surprised by how good it worked for me.  As I said, I'm not great at styling my hair.  I really wanted something to help with the cowlick I have in the back and it did a great job with that.I'd recommend it."
685,1,"Four stars, but not for me_Arrived fast. Something worth mentioning if you are giving this as a gift, the box was perfect. I made a big order, and several of the items arrived in boxes that were damaged.About the cologne, even though I personally don't like the smell(very very fresh scent), it does last a long time.The smell is very pleasing in itself, just not what I was expecting.If you prefer a milder fresh scent, you will probably love it."
3283,1,"Works well on adult acne/pimples, takes away redness quickly_When you get older life plays another trick on you... adult pimples!I get a few small ones on my forehead from working (wearing a helmet when I grind, the strap traps dirt/sweat)I also get a pimple or two after I shave, around my neck.Typically the ones on my neck are red and painful, so when I saw the description:'Visibly reduces pimple size & redness in as little as 4 hours' I was like .. ok.. let's see.It comes in a toothpaste style tube, it is not watery or too thick. It is white and rubs in clear.The verdict? This stuff works! I noticed later that day (not sure if it was 4 hours later, but it WAS the same day),that the pimple on my neck wasn't as red and it didn't hurt so much. Two days later it was just about gone!I have since used it on my forehead, and same results.. nice clear skin. I didn't notice any stinging/dryness from the product myself.All I can ask is, where was stuff like this when I was a teenager? .. it really works! I would say give it a try for sure.****Jim"
3513,1,"Amazon is so easy to work with_I ordered these Roc Disks and the first order arrived after most of the fluid had leaked in the shipping box. I contacted Amazon and had a replacement jar the very next day. Not even sure how they got it here that fast. Beyond my experience with Amazon, I also like this product. I'm in my 40's and think these are too strong/drying to use every day but they do provide a mini-facial experience by exfoliating and deep cleaning my skin."
308,1,Great Cleanser!_I have used this cleanser in the past and have gotten great results. It smells wonderful and leaves my face clean without over drying it. I would recommend this face wash.
9097,1,"Nice size bar, does not smell bad and this stuff works._Great soap, I think it has a nice smell, given it contains sulfur.  I got it for a skin condition, and so far it helps, I really like the way it lathers, and I soak it as per instructions, 20 seconds in warm water, I don't think my condition was scabies, have yet to get a Dr. opinion.  If this clears up my condition, well worth the buy.Update:  I have been using this twice daily as directed, for one week now, and my skin condition is almost entirely clear.  Now believe this was a scabies infestation, and this soap is clearing it, may skip the dermatologist appointment coming up. Highly, recommend. I can' say enough about his soap, it did save me a $200 trip to a dermatologist, because the rash has disappeared , I will definitely be buying more."
4329,1,"Great stuff_This makeup is great if you're not looking for a lot of coverage. If you have a lot of trouble spots, I wouldn't recommend this. While this is more than a tint, it is light to medium coverage foundation.  This enhances your skin, but really looks like you don't have foundation on. It does even out the skintone, but it's very subtle. My skin just looks really fresh and feels fresh too. It only takes a minute for the color to match. It comes out of the tube white.  Yes, it looks just like a moisturizer, but it soons develops color that matches your skin tone.  When choosing your proper color, it's not neccesary to get an exact match. You just need to choose a shade close to yours. The container itself represents the approximate shade or tone the foundation will become. Just stay in that family of colors and you'll be fine. Resist the urge to pile in on. This is very important to note: This makeup is not buildable, more is not better and it becomes hard for the color to match properly if you slather it on.It's very fresh and very natural looking. You skin feels like it can breath. I believe Revlon put some, good for your skin, ingredients in this formula. I've gotten comments like; 'your face looks so nice, you must have gotten a lot of rest' LOL. Also, it stays on all day. It does not rub off. No makeup transfer.  It doesn't drip off and stain your collar in humid weather. I can't wear mineral makeup because it breaks me out.  This is the closest I have found to the durability, naturalness, and sweatproof of mineral foundation....without the flyaway powder mess. This is as easy as putting on a little moisturizer."
9735,1,"It works_I use Caress Body Wash a lot and like it.  It lathers well and a little goes a long way.  It rinses off well and doesn't dry out my skin. I enjoyed this new scent as well.  It is strong so if you are sensitive to scents you might not like this, but the scent doesn't last for long either so I have no problem with it."
8529,1,"No build up! I love it!_I've been using both Nexxus Renewal shampoo and conditioner (see that review) as a set for several weeks, and I have to say, the combo's a winner.I love the conditioner because it doesn't build up (at least so far), and I don't get that mangy mutt greasy head look.The shampoo is wonderful. The smell is heavenly, and it doesn't take a lot to get a headful of lather. Rinses out nicely, works great in tandem with the matching conditioner.My big thing with these shampoo/conditioner sets target to the 'your hair is getting old, too' crowd is that they often have a horrible build up problem that weighs your hair down and makes it look even thinner. So far, I have NOT have that problem with Nexxus Renewal (knock wood!)The other thing is that it smells wonderful! I've tried a few different types of youth-oriented hair sets, and honestly, one smells worse than the other (the last one made me gag. It smelled like an open tar pit.) do they think it works better the worse it smells?Nexxus is a pleasure to use. My wavy, fine, abundant hair is tamed and shows no signs of build up.I recommend both!"
679,1,"A dependable classic_I've been wearing this cologne for more than ten years now. And, while I may go through phases with most colognes, this one still finds its way onto me at least once per week. It simply doesn't get old. The scent itself is cool and deep, with a sensual bent; the kind of thing that works in any kind of situation (whether it be summer nights on the beach, winter days in the snow, or a business meeting). If you are faced with a situation in which you don't know what cologne is appropriate, go with this one. The price has remained fair. And the bottle will last. Buy now."
3843,1,"I was looking for a product like this_To cover one sparse area and a couple of white eyebrow hairs, and also to smooth the eyebrows down if they get rumpled. This is very good and I recommend it. With the wax, the powder lasts all day."
4775,1,"Very Nice_I have thick, curly hair, so straighteners are truly tested on me.  This is a great product.  The controls are on the side and must be pushed in, so it's difficult to accidentally turn off or change temperatures.  Plus the controls are digital, so you can see an actual temperature rather than the typical low-high scale. There is even a turbo setting.  It beeps when ready - nice if you are multitasking and it heats quickly.  The pearl coated plates slide effortlessly through my hair.  The rsults are great, too.  My hair was shiny, silky and did not have any frizzies."
6077,1,"Not the best, not the worst._This stuff works. It doesn't give me the sleek, Hollywood hair that more expensive products do, but it does its best. I don't notice much of a difference when using pre-blowdry (my hair ends up still wavy and like straw), but when I use pre-straightener, my hair stays sleek and straight all day (unless it's exceptionally humid or it rains). The smell is also pretty pleasant.Overall, I really only tried this when I was in a pinch and just wanted to grab something at Walmart. It does its job, but doesn't blow me away. I won't intentionally go seeking this out again."
3768,1,"Pretty good_I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Naked Palette by Urdan Decay.  I can't say this is 100% as good, but for the money it is great!  I like the colors and it is farily pigmented."
9427,1,"Use From the Beinning_So the John Frieda Precision Foam Hair Color seems to support your dye as opposed to filling in further in the process when it is already faded.Two family members used the John Frieda Precision Foam Hair Color and the one who applied it once a week, starting right after the dyed their hair was happy with the product. She felt it maintained the color's pigments, freshness, and shine.The one who used it on hair that had been dyed a few weeks before felt it added shine and may have helped the color the tiniest bit when she used it, but not to the point that it would be worth buying this extra product well between dye jobs.The second one however, is interested in trying it from the start of a dye job to see if it maintained the color better since her sister was happy with those results and felt it did give her a truer brunette color without the reds/oranges popping up or the hair looking dull throughout the course of the dye job's life."
2029,1,"Sophisticated and elegant_This summer, my mother placed some jasmine flowers in our sun room. She had several kinds, but one of them (which was the smallest plant) had a particularly strong scent with the few flowers it had. It smelled so good and I guess that summer memory led me to find a jasmine-scented perfume. I love the smell of this perfume because it is sophisticated and elegant, and yet it is fresh and not overpowering. I love the mid notes and base notes! The bottle is also very beautiful. It reminds me of the historical Japanese houses. This is definitely not a girly perfume as it does not have a sweet sugary smell to it. I recommend this to anyone who has a mature type of personality who embodies grace and elegance."
3446,1,"Luxury for Your Face_Olay's Professional Pro-X Intensive Wrinkle kit consists of elegantly packaged wrinkle cream, a tube of intensive anti-wrinkle potion for under the eyes, and a daytime moisturizer with a nice heavy-duty sunscreen.  It works as well as the product I hold every other up to for quality, Eucerin Co-Q10 cream.The products are fragrance-free except for a light pleasant fragrance typical of sunscreens.  It moisturizes and it's lovely to look at.But it's expensive and pay attention to the amount of product in each beautiful bottle - the gorgeous containers are deceptively large.This would make a wonderful gift -- but guys, don't buy your signicant other wrinkle cream unless she makes sure you know she wants it! Trust me on that.I'd give five stars for quality and eye candy, but I'd give it 2 stars for price.  I'll keep my thriftier subscription for Eucerin via Amazon.  It does the same thing for a lot less!Eucerin Sensitive Facial Skin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Creme, 1.7-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)"
2714,1,"Moisturizes well_Well, it definitely works on my body. It gets rid of dry skin very well.  It would seem like it would be difficult for it not to work though, especially since Vaseline always made great lotion. I just wish it smelled like their other lotion, Vaseline Total Moisture. I'm use to that scent. It does not smell bad. It smells like normal lotion, but I'm just use to the scent that comes from Vaseline Total Moisture."
3303,1,"As close as I have found to a professional dryer_I could get a professional dryer through my hairdresser friends, but am not willing to fork over the $150+ for one. This little baby gets super hot and does an amazing job of drying my very thick, curly hair straight. It leaves my hair very shiny when I go straight. It is a little heavy, but feels quality.I only gave it 4 stars due to the lack of a diffuser. I purchased a &#34;universal&#34; diffuser, but the dryer's nozzle is so narrow that the diffuser pops off every minute or so. I wish it came with a diffuser that fits."
5023,1,"Less Blackheads_It really helps clean my pores more on my chin and nose which is what I need.I don't use it every time I wash my face. I just listen to the skin and know if it was irritated before washing. Angling the device allows the bristles to clean more and damage less on the skin, or drying out sooner.I make sure to use a toner and than moisturizer, whats the point of shedding the old skin off and cleaning the pores if your not going to take care of the new one.Works better than the neutrogena sonic wave cleaners however they are softer on your skin and only vibrates (so you can use them frequently).Also the device seems the same the acne-free brand when a friend let me used it.Important note- I thought by trying this and making sure my pores were cleaned better I would get less break outs. It didn't turn out to be the case but my face has a natural nice glow to it where my skin is clear."
9111,0,"Stopped working after 3 months._UPDATED REVIEW: May 15, 2014After 3 months of use the flatiron stopped working. I would turn it on but it would not heat up. I contacted the company by email and three days later they replied instructing me to return the iron and they would send me a new one as soon as they received it.I mailed the iron on March 21. Five weeks later (May 1st) I had not received a replacement, so I again emailed the company. No reply. Sent another email on May 8th. No reply. On May 14th I received as a replacement a different model flatiron, theTS-2 Hybrid Professional Styling Iron. It is a very basic flat iron with none of the features (digital, auto shutoff, dual voltage) of the 3-month-old Millennium that I returned. I checked the company website and the Millennium no longer appears on their product page - perhaps it has been discontinued? I don't know because there was no explanation for the substitution and my emails went unanswered.I understand that a product can be defective. I liked the Millennium Flat Iron and originally rated it 4 stars. If the company had stood behind their warranty and replaced the defective iron, my review would have remained at 4 stars. However, I no longer have a Millennium Flat Iron. Mine lasted 3 months and then died. I appreciate that a replacement flat iron was eventually sent, but the customer service experience should be better than this.As much as I liked the original flat iron, I can no longer recommend buying it because, if it breaks, you may not get a replacement.ORIGINAL REVIEW - 4 Stars: January 6, 2014The TS-2 Millennium Flat Iron is replacing a Chi that I have been using for the past five years but has now stopped working.The TS-2 has a nice shape with a rounded tip and thin design making it easy to style my short, frizzy hair. It heats up fast and in about 30 seconds it was ready to use.A few things to note:The flat iron defaults to 180C every time I turn it off. I want the heat at 200C so I need to remember to turn it up each time I use it. A small annoyance.The dual voltage for international use is nice to have but the downside is a much thicker cord that is a little more clunky to use than the flat, lighter weight, 110-only type cord. It took a few weeks to get used to it.The side edge of the plastic outer casing gets quite hot. I have short hair and have to be very careful not to brush my neck when getting close to the hairline. My old Chi had an outer housing that stayed cool to the touch and I miss that safety feature.Overall I am happy with the way the TS-2 styles my hair and if it lasts five years like my last iron I will be thrilled."
3071,1,It straighten's pretty good but doesnt glide that well over hair._It feels like sometimes it is going to snag my hair but never does. But it does straighten okay but if you turn it up too high it will burn your hair. I would recommend a straighter with ion technology. and or titanium plates.
339,1,Drying but a clean wash - cept for the dark residue_I smell like a BBQ... or fireplace! I actually love it. It's super drying on my skin though. Even worse on my face. I feel clean though.
869,1,"Prettiest soft pink_If your looking for a soft nude pink nail polish this is the one for you. I absolutely love this color, it doesn't chip as fast as other nail polishes I have from OPI. You can build this color up to make it darker. The polish dries pretty fast, I applied 3 coats and it didn't take very long to dry."
9519,1,When used as a haircare system..._I've been using the three products in this line for several weeks now. I love the scent!Breakage is a huge problem for me because I keep my hair very long so I've been making use of the system together and so far I can't honestly say I'm seeing a huge difference in how much breakage there is but my hair texture has significantly improved. It's smoother and each strand feels much stronger.This conditioner is great if you also have hair that tends to go flat like mine does. It's nourishing but doesn't make my hair so heavy it flattens in an hour post shower. For the price this is a great conditioner if you have long straight hair and I haven't noticed any trouble with it affecting my hair coloring either.
4128,0,"Has Some Value But Don't Expect Miracles_My partner agreed to test this product for me, and we shared our observations, which were very similar. It does seem to make the skin *feel* smoother, and she liked that, but as she pointed out, almost any facial cream will do the same, and for far less money, of course.  If you badly want to see fewer or more shallow wrinkles, you probably will, but if the difference isn't entirely an illusion, it's certainly far from dramatic; I told her I frankly wouldn't have noticed if she hadn't mentioned she'd been using something new, and she agreed that any actual wrinkle reduction was very hard to discern.  She noted that care must be taken to make sure you don't get any of the eye cream in your eye, because it's pretty unpleasant when you do, but that aside, both of us did notice a slight improvement in the appearance of the darkness under her eyes--but this seemed purely on the surface; as soon as she stopped using it, the 'results' evaporated, we agreed.As a guy who didn't personally use the product, I hesitate to say more, but I'll say this: if you're looking for actual, significant wrinkle reduction, in my observation this is a waste of money.  If you're looking to feel a little pampered, and are satisfied with any kind of improvement you can get, however temporary, this product costs a lot more than ordinary skin lotions, but a lot less than many products that I'm guessing don't do much more."
2751,0,don't waste your money_don't waste your money on this.  There are better products and I would order this again  Look up Illuminesce DMAE on amazon.
1632,1,"Excellent baby nail clipper_Being a person who fixates on weird objects and must try all of them until I figure out which are the BEST, I recently ordered these Seki Edge Baby Nail Clippers and also the yellow Tweezerman Baby Nail Clippers I found here on Amazon. The Seki clippers are the best I've found to replace an old pair that have gotten quite dull. Their most important feature? The blades are sharp enough to clip precisely and the head is narrow enough to work well on tiny fingers.For the past 6 years, I've been trying to find a second pair of the fantastic baby nail clippers that I got SOMEWHERE after my first child was born, but the fog of sleep deprivation (or the flurry of baby showers) left me utterly blank as to where those came from. I bought pair after pair of clippers from the drugstore, the grocery store, the baby superstore at the mall... Most baby clippers are too dull, leaving me to tear (instead of quickly clip) my restless kids wiggly fingers. Many baby nail clippers have ridiculously bulky plastic casings and often cheap, useless 'magnifying glass' parts that get in the way and slow down what needs to be quick work. (My older son is is school-aged now, but still fights me when it comes time to trim his scraggly nails.)The old, exalted baby nail clipper was, quite simply, a tiny version of the same all metal nail clippers I use on myself. The cutting blade narrows from the width of the clipper body on the old ones--and, probably not coincidentally, on the Seki clippers, too--but, otherwise they look just like the full size version. These Seki clippers differ from my old ones in that the body is narrower than an adult pair, but the overall length of the nail clippers is about the usual size of an adult pair. The underside of the lever handle has a 'nail file' area like many adult clippers. They also have raised metal pieces running down what would usually be the open sides of the two long, flat parts that end in the two cutting blades. This is probably designed to catch the clippings, but, at least in our restless nail clipping experience, you'll still be better off clipping over a wastebasket."
2770,1,"Cetaphil Daily Lotion_I use this Cetaphil Daily Advance Lotion for Dry Sensitive Skin on my legs and feet every day and I have been using it now for several months and I really like it.  My legs and feet are always very dry and Cetaphil seems to correct this.  It is a bit thick but it does rub in easily and feels very soft, I do not like silky feeling lotion and this is not silky after using it, my skin looks and feels SOFT after applying it.  Great deal great product."
3316,1,"Love this!_Love this moisturizer! I use it every day, mixed with a little extra bronzer gel. There's definitely a limit to the color build up, so you don't have to worry about looking orange at all. I would recommend applying the lotion all the way down the neck and behind the ears though, just so the color is even ;)"
7256,0,Left me with straw like hair_I bought this after reading the reviews.  I love a product recommended by my hairdresser but it is so expensive I decided to find something cheaper to do the same thing.  I have used the packaged product once and the shampoo and conditioner about 4 times.  My hair is not any less yellow and now feels like straw.  I will give away since I threw away the packaging and go bite the bullet and spend the money on the better product.
9984,1,"Best Vitamin C Serum I have tried!_After using the Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum for three weeks; I was highly impressed with the smoothness, and fresh feeling of my skin. It really made a radiant change to my skin tone and texture. There is even better news this product will help fade your sun spot!  It can also help diminish your spider veins, and best of all ...I used my hands to apply this product, so my hands also became softer! Who would have thought that you could find that much magic in one little bottle of Joyal Beauty's Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum!! This product also comes with a pump over a dropper. I love that feature on the bottle. There is less chance of spillage, and it is also easier to dispense. I know when I am applying products to my face the last thing I want to do is get the bottle all messy from the product already on my hands while I attempt to close it.With out a doubt this product gets a five star and two thumbs up review!Disclosure: I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion. To read the rest of my review, please visit the blog (Krazy Coupon Club)! Above is just a small portion of my thoughts."
7764,1,More POWER is good_This has a very easy to use push top that makes it easy to get just the right amount of product for your face onto fingertips. Two pushes is just right for the whole face. The product is no miracle face-lift product but does make my face feel somewhat smoother and very moisturized.
1321,0,"Awful._I have thick, brown hair that is prone to drying out and frizzing.  This product actually made it worse.  It certainly 'mended' my hair by making it sticky.  The only good thing is it smells good.  Other than that, it made my hair even frizzier and it tangled more than before."
4199,0,"Poor design. High price._This dispenser is way to poorly made and designed for the price!When you push down, the liquid spurts out all over the place. You have to be very careful to gently push down very lightly and that is so frustrating when you bought it to make nail polish painting/removing easier.Thumbs down! I hate writing negative reviews unless I'm very unhappy with the product."
651,1,"Great stuff_This is a really great product. The only down side is the fragrance. It actually smells like the perfume vanilla fields. If you like that then this will be perfect as the product does work, and makes your hair soft and even shiny. The smell is strong, and I am not a big fan of vanilla scents so I don't like that about it, but once it's dry in your hair you can't smell it anymore."

7161,1,"A great base for a natural look with the strong protection of a sunscreen SPF 40_This product is great for those times when one feels like not wearing much makeup, but still wants to look good. The best feature is the sleek way it blends over the skin living a perfect clean look and feel. During years, I've been using regular sunscreen on my neck front and back, arms and legs, but for the face, I've never found anything that didn't feel heavy, or messed up under makeup. So Cotz for Face Balanced Mineral Complex is a nice addition to my cosmetics' arsenal.I was surprised to notice that it covered some irregularities over my face, making it smooth but shine-free. To complete a natural look, only mascara and lip gloss is needed. I wore it today while going for a morning walk and later to simply run errands, and like it very much, so in spite of its price, I will be buying it for sure."
8593,1,"luxurious disposable razors_im usually use the cheap bic razors, so after using these, its quite the upgrade.

At least for me it dose not work much. I need to go and take lorazpam!Since I paid for it, I use it as kind of face moisturizer on my face before sleep:)))"
9957,1,"Immediate results_This is a facial moisturizer that will tone your skin.  By tone I mean to make it look smooth all over.  I put this on my face and immediately I could see that my face looked EVEN all over as if I had on a little bit of makeup.The moisturizer is not oily, not too smelly, and not too sticky.  There is a slight coca butter smell but it is not bad. If you put a heavy amount on your face it might feel a tad sticky until it drys, if you put a normal amount on your face then it will not be sticky.You can possibly wear this moisturizer under your makeup, I did not put on any makeup after applying the toner to my face, I stayed natural.  I also used this moisturizer on my hand to remove the dryness.  This is a nice product and I definitely recommend it.[sample provided]"
937,0,CAUTION: NOT DUAL VOLTAGE!_Do not buy this product if you are planning to use it in countries with 220v output. This is not dual voltage and you'd have to use a converter. I'm very disappointed and am sending it back immediately.
6060,1,Great set_I bought these with USpicy Macaron UUSND-3603 Professional UV Acrylic Gel light.  I can do my nails when I want (around 14 days) and the results are great.
7797,1,hair extensions_these are okay the clips seem to pull at my hair more and hurt more and they seem to tangle alot more so i have to brush them alot but for the price these extensions are really pretty and the color is nice also.

9213,1,"Perfect Rhinestone Picker_These pencils last through many, many pick-ups of nail art before the need for sharpening.  They don't leave a residue on the art after dropping it to the nail.

Hold hair up and back comb down in ONE direction (not back and forth)."
9108,1,"Like, don't love_My mom and sister have both been using the Olay Pro-X for about a year, and have had nothing negative to say about it.  Personally, I am a devoted user of my Mia, and have been overall happy enough with it to not go looking for additional 'face brushes'.However, I haven't found a microdermabrasion treatment yet that I have been satisfied with and, when given the chance to try Olay's version, I went for it.  Now, this isn't a separate system from the normal Pro-X; the Microdermabrasion aspect comes in the form of an additional 'brush' for the the Pro-X--more like a cotton round, really--as well as their own cleansing crystal formula.I have been happy with its use, although I must say that I don't feel the same cleansing 'pressure' on my skin that I do with the Mia, in the use of either extension for the Pro-X.  The included cleansers, however, are nice, if not amazing.  They have a nice smell, and leave me with a clean feeling (although as with any crystal microdermabrasion cleanser, be extra careful to fully rinse off any residual crystals).There are different speeds as well, which was new for me (the Mia only has one).  However, I didn't find myself really using this feature too much, as I found the faster speeds to feel even less thorough than the slower ones.  Also, I found myself missing the Mia's timed cycle of 60 seconds.  This might seem a rather insignificant concern, but it was just something that makes me lean towards using the Mia over the Pro-X from what I'm used to.For the price, this is definitely a great system, but I don't think I would recommend it over the Mia."

1483,0,"A step of from level 6_I stepped to level 9, after using level 6 for about eight months. Once I stepped up I finally began to see wrinkles become less prominent, and my acne more manageable. However, my skin became so red and irritated and my usually oily skin began to dry out. The results I did see were not worth the side effects and were not worth the money. Green Cream in general has a high alcohol content, and I first became aware of this when I started using Level 9 and found out this is what was most likely making my skin dry. There are far better retinol treatments on the market, especially for the amount that is paid for these products."

5417,1,"Great sunscreen_I use this sunscreen lotion for when I anticipate a long day outdoors.  Some of the active ingredients are suspect, (as per the Environmental Working Group) but the sunscreen goes on easy and doesn't leave a greasy feeling or overly powerful smell.  I would recommend this for everyday use."

I sagged at the thought of finding a drier that was going to dry and style my hair.  BadaBing!  This drier is quiet, light weight, versatile and in a price range most of us can afford.  I am in Babylis heaven!"
7355,1,"Much better for dry, curly hair than conditioner alone_My hair is naturally curly and usually very dry with highlights and shampoo is not part of my everyday routine because of the dryness. At first the fact that there is no lather is very strange but the scent was pleasant enough to press forward. Using a pump so many times is also a little odd in the shower and it does not feel like that amount of product will go very far. The results, however, speak for themselves. The conditioning cleanser cleaned both hair and scalp thoroughly leaving no styling product residue. My hair actually felt soft and clean. It was a much better result than 'washing' my hair with conditioner alone which never quite seemed to do the trick. I'm really impressed!My only comments are: The pump bottle is a little more work than I'd like in the shower but it's not a deal breaker considering the product cuts down on shower time overall. Also, the product does say you can use it as a leave-in conditioner but compared to my current favorite (Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Curl Silkening Detangler Hair Care 8.5 Fl Oz) it's really more effective in the shower than out."
2281,1,"REFECTOCIL CREAM EYELASH HAIR DYE (PURE BLACK)_OK  I read the reviews. I watched application video's on youtube. I planned this in my head...Here is what I learned as a first time user.  Yes it does work.  I washed my face and eyes. I had an old mascara brush clean and ready to use.. But NO that didn't work. The under eye pads also were not for me.  I mixed the solution in a small glass bowl using approx. 1/4 of an inch of dye and approx. 5 drops of hydrogen peroxide. I used Vaseline on my eyes. As close to the lash line as I could get it. I ended up using the tool that came with the dye.  I did the dying using a magnifying lighted makeup mirror.  One eye at a time. I left it on for approx. 15 minutes...I WAS VERY CAREFUL. I felt a minor bit of stinging, no big deal. I used an old clean damp cloth to remove the dye. I did manage to stain the first two fingers on my right hand so next time I'll use vaseline or thin gloves also  I did get a bit of dye on one top lid but not enough to freak out... My lashes are thin and light so I chose black.  It actually does work.................2nd time I used paper towels under my eyes. I had to slightly dampen them to get them to stick. I still got some on the lid of my right eye but used the other end of the applicator to rub is off....Both times I got dye on my right index finger. I must remember to use vaseline on my finger...I'm happy with the results..."
8191,0,Very Disappointed NOT AS DESCRIBED!_Shipped quickly but items were not as described. description says &#34;each glass bottle has 200 to 2000 pieces inside&#34; BULL! Dimensions of bottles should be disclosed (size of the top half of your pinky)as well as some of the vials only had a couple of stones in them. I cannot even do one hand much less all 10 fingers the same with half the products. Will never purchase something like this online again without exact counts per bottle & dimensions per bottle.
4419,1,"pretty_great deal for the set price- awesome color combination, works well as a lipstick base, or even on its own!"
9069,1,"You MUST buy this if you want your manicue to last_I have never had a gel manicure because they are hard on your nails and I believe removing the polish is not so easy. My nails are very weak and chip and flake and break very easily.Regular manicures are the way i go, but they do not last unless i take the time to apply a fresh topcoat every day or so.  If I do that, I might get a full week from the manicure.  THIS TOP COAT IS A GAME CHANGER!!!!  You can use it with other Vinylux colors or even with regular polish.  One coat and I can easily get a week or more out of my regular manicure......If I reapply,  I have had my nails looking good for up to 2 weeks.  It is far superior to any other top coat i have tried."
2965,1,"THIS LOTION HAS GLITTER IN IT_I love Olay in shower body lotion since it came out a few years ago with the name 'Moisturinse.'  I bought out the shelves at my local drugstore when it fell to half price, fearing it was about to be discontinued.  My devotion has remained steadfast even though Olay has changed the name (it was 'Moisturinse,' then 'Quench') and despite the fact that my local stores no longer stocked it on their shelves.Despite all these obstacles, I am a loyal fan and regular user of this in-shower lotion.So when I used up my travel supply during a winter visit to the midwest and couldn't find any at the local store, I was pleased to find Olay In-Shower Body Lotion in a newly restyled bottle on Amazon and ordered up a couple of bottles to tide me over.  They arrived just in time.Holy heck, when did Olay reformulate this stuff to include GLITTER?!  My skin has little specks of glimmer clinging to it now and I feel like one of those mirrored disco balls.  I read through the description here on Amazon and nowhere in the description do I see that they've added sparkles to the formula.The lotion still does its awesome job of moisturizing my skin, but please, Olay, ditch the glimmer stuff.  I am a middle aged woman with dry skin, not a disco queen.I have never given a less-than-stellar review to Olay products, but my sparkly skin causes me to subtract one star."
8579,1,Works great!_Great primer for applying nail tips.  It is strong so be careful not to get on skin as it does sting.  Very happy with purchase.
735,1,"First worked for three years, second for three seconds_Due to our bathroom layout, a dryer with a retractable cors and folding handle works best.  I bought one of these three years ago.  It was used almost daily by my husband.  Due to his current hair 'style' (short on the sides, missing on the top),  each use was for less than a minute.When it stopped working (just wouldn't turn on), I looked for another model, but this was the only one with both the handle and cord features.  Easy decision. I ordered another and put it in his cabinet.  The next day he tried it (he forgot his old one had broken and said that it only went on for a few seconds before it would turn off.  It turned back on without any resets, but repeatedly stayed on for only a few seconds.So, I dug out the box from the recycling and returned it to Amazon.  Two days later, the third one was in his cabinet.  Three weeks later, Dryer #3 is working fine.Basically it is a decent, no frills dryer that does exactly what it is supposed to."
1031,1,"Nice base coat_This nail polish does it's job! Goes on first, keeps my nails from turning yellow.Not too expensive and easy to apply"
416,1,"Nice at any price_Very good product for generally keeping aging skin looking smooth.  I've found better, but I occasionally buy this when it's a great deal.  The entire Roc line is very good.  Great?  Not compared to a line like Strivectin, for example.  But that's just my experience.  Worth a try without breaking the bank."
6090,1,so cute_this little train case is so nice for smaller jobs. you can fit your essentials in it--makeup and brushes. cute color.
1379,0,"Great product_The product itself is great, it removes all makeup in the first wash, and doesn't leave a drying feeling. The only problem I had was with the seller, when the cleanser arrived it was too watery, and smelled rancid. I couldn't find any expiration date on the bottle, but I knew it was way past it by the consistency and smell of the actual product. I love the Alpha Hydrox products and will continue to purchase them, however I will NEVER buy from this seller again."
7048,1,"Interesting._I'd heard these help get rid of brown patches on your skin. My sister tried them and told me about it. After three months of daily Astaxanthin, the brown patches on her face had disappeared. I've seen her so I know it's true. I've been on them for a few weeks, and mine are lightening already. I'd say give it a try."
7942,1,"A must have_I have been using this moisturizer for almost two weeks now and I've noticed a drastic difference in the pigmentation of my skin. My acne marks are almost gone and the dark circles around my eyes is gone. My neck and face are actually one color now since using this and I rub some on my lips at night so it evens out the skin tone. This cost double the price at sephora so I'm glad I found it on amazon for half the price; I am really loving this product, because it works and does what it says. I also use this with the PTR glycolic acid face wash which is really helping the resilience in my skin."
7766,1,"Half full wheel_I wasn't expecting much considering how cheap it was, so I was happy to see that the wheel was half full instead of having just a few pearls like some people got. Considering how expensive these nail art pearls can get where I live, I still think it's a good deal for this product."
4862,1,Lots of sparkles_I got this with Pink Smoothie and Sheek White and made peacock design on top of Pink Smoothie. Very sparkly and easy to use. Very fine sparkles in clear polish.
4055,1,"opino_es rico el aroma es suave, delicado para una mujer pava, recomiendo el producto es ta adaptado a la actualidad."
2547,0,"Not Worth It_I fell in love with using rollers after using my mom's set from probably the 80's, I have no idea how old they were, but they got hot as h*ll, and would burn the crap outta your fingers, and the side of your face if you rested them on your skin.  Ah, those were the days..I had been using an old set of Conair velvet rollers for years.  Unfortunately, while I liked the rollers themselves, the clips to keep them in place were like claw clips, and would create bends in my hair.  I should have just bought the U wire clips (the kind that come with this particular set), but instead I bought this set.It looks like my mothers old set, as it has the nubs around to capture the hair, but these do not get as hot.  The style doesn't last long without using a lot of product.  I have fine, thick hair, that is about mid-back in length.I used these with various products: Manic Panic Volume cream, Bumble and Bumble Curl Conscious styling creme, Bumble and Bumble Styling Lotion, Herbal Essences curl mouse, hairspray, moulding cream, and a generic hairspray.  I used a Tresseme heat styling spray.  Nothing really kept the curl to hold all night.  I say all night, but thats typically just 2-3 hours, if that.Anyway, I bit the bullet and bought a ceramic styling wand when I saw it on sale on Hautelook for $50.  Best investment ever.  I will still use these hot rollers for the back under pieces of my hair, as they are hard for me to reach with the styling wand and are not very visible anyway."
1156,1,"Rich and smooth._I have oily skin, so finding a good soap is important my skin and sanity. Usually dry soaps left my skin too dry, but did take away the oil. I thought after a while that that just can't be good. So I ventured from body washes to soap bars, and found the basis Sensitive Skin soap.In a word: sweet.This soap lathers rather well with loofah, and doesn't need much to get my full body. My skin does indeed feel smother and softer during and after the wash. I tried other soaps after just to make sure it wasn't my mind playing tricks on me, but, sure enough, I noticed the difference.It's a bit pricey, but for oily and sensitive skin, it's the best I've used so far. There may be a better soap, but I haven't found it. Amazon sure makes it easy to order this soap, and it works just as nice."
9790,1,"Unique awesomeness for your face!_First off I loved the clean packaging, then I read the ingredients and I was in love.I mean all of the ingredients in the mask are awesome and good for you, also its not tested on animals!I'm used to mud masks drying up my face but this one left it clarified and touch-ably soft :)I can go on and on but you'll have to try it for myself &#60;3P.S. I have acne and this didn't make me break out. :D"
7629,1,I love it_I order this for my daughter who is now pursuing a hobby in applying false nails. She now has all of the material that is needed for her to become quite an expert in applying nails. She is excited about having all the material to work with. She has begun to practice making/building her own acrylic nails using this product. I received this earlier than expected and no damage. Thanks.
3932,1,Cotton Squares_These are good quality.  I also like the fact that they are separated.  I hate the ones you have to rip apart.
2110,0,"What a joke_I tried this product because I assumed that for the price tag this product would produce something darn near close to a mircle for my sensitive, acne-prone skin.WRONG! IT clogged my pores, cause a huge breakout and did absolutely nothing for my skin. My dermatologist laughed when I told her I tried this product. I even tried the 'gel' version, thinking maybe the cream was a bit too heavy for my skin.But no - save your hard earned cash - the only thing this product has going for it is that it smells sort of nice."
3681,1,"Lovin' it!_This product is all I had hoped it would be. Do I look 20 years younger? No, but I've had fewer breakouts and my skin is smoother/softer. I can live with that. I appreciate the vendor - nice price and no problem with the shipping and condition of the product."
975,1,"I'm gettinnnnggg there!_First of all, this feels exactly (sounds like it the most) like sandpapering your face, without the pain. It's very easy to do, and hand tiring too. I did notice results. The scrub smells so wonderful. When you apply the bottle solution thing over the crystals, it feels so nice, it makes your face warm too. You do feel like you had a facial, even better than a facial! It cleans out your pores completely. This does fully extend my nightly routine and soaks up all the products! Will continue to buy!"
7368,0,Bristles too long_Bristles too long and a little scratchy. I cut it down but still didn't help. I returned it. Need to start over with this one!
2674,0,Didn't work for me._This product didn't work for me. Can't complaint since hair types differ and not everything works for everyone. Returned it immediately?
459,1,"Grreat gloves.............._to use at night, after putting on lotion, does make my hands nice and moiste in the morning, however, one glove seems to always come off by the morning,but i till like them."
4236,1,"Pricey but worth it for me_A bit pricey, but my hairdresser gave me a gift bag that was wonderful for my latest trip so I didn't need to mess with mini containers.  I love their products, and my thick, curly hair is easier to comb out and soft, smooth and shiny.  You don't need to use a lot of product either."
2308,1,Works great!_I love this scrub! I use it every other day. Works great and makes my face look so clear and even :] I would recommend this ~
3585,0,not effective_not very effective
9236,1,Five Stars_Great stuff!  Quick & easy.
1744,1,Great every day conditioner for color treated hair_I have both the NouNou and Love conditioner  by Davines and they both provide amazing softness without feeling weighted down. the price is the best I've found in awhile.
5035,1,"Happy purchase. Happy Skin_Id been struggling with the idea of buying a Clarisonic after all the hype thats been out there, but it feels too expensive for a person that had tried to use face brushes before, but left them because they caused breakouts. My skin is oily combination, and I live in a city with extreme weather ( above 100F on summer and cold and icy at winter), so keeping my face clean has always been an issue.So I convinced myself that I should try this one, and Ive been using it for 2 months now and I cant be happier. My skin hasnt been this softer in years, and a lot of sun spots have faded. I use it at night, after I took off my makeup, and once a week I use a exfoliating scrub with it. The brush is gentle, it doesnt feel harsh at all, the 2-speed setting seems adecuate to start with the slow one and after a while go to the full speed. At first I had a couple of breakouts but it depends on how much pressure I put on it. Its safe for shower use.I know that its not comparable to clarisonic because this is a rotating brush instead of a sonic technology but for the price seems just right, its better than just washing your face for sure, it has helped my makeup to stay longer and look better. I recommend this a lot to my friends, perhaps I would be careful if I had acne-prone skin, or check with my dermathologyst.Ps: Putting the batteries on is a nightmare. Go and find a youtube tutorial in that case, so you wont struggle"
5742,1,Good Quality_So far I'm a fan of Real Techniques brushes. The price is reasonable and the quality is just as good as more expensive brushes.
6206,1,"Nice color_The color is not as neon in person, it's more of a purple popsicle stain. When when a photo is taken with a flash it looks just like the picture :)"
7592,1,"Mixed_Although i do like this eyeliner and will continue to use it for my top line, i can't give it 5stars because when used on my bottom waterline it does tend to run after about an hour, but lasts for my top line without running all day!"
4608,1,"Variety!_The colors are really nice, they are smaller then I thought they were tho. I havent had a chance to use them but they will add a nice little touch to your nails"
4721,1,Wow!_What a great product! The crazy wand reaches places a traditional brush cannot. Great for lower and/or inner lashes. Thanks!
5370,1,TOTALLY AWESOME PRODUCT_A must have for beginners to gurus!!! Awesome product and great end design!!! A must have for all nail polish fanatics!!!!
3974,1,"Hmm..._Ok.  The brush is great! Soft and seems durable. However, the bristles are longer than I anticipated. Also, it picks up my liquid foundation, but does not distribute it as well as I would like. I'll continue to use it, though. The seller is amazing. I received this item in a day. Kudos!!!"
8811,1,"My new favorite gadget_I recently moved into a new condo that is very contemporary.  So, functionality aside, this mirror gets 5 stars for looks alone.  It is very sleek and well made.  It looks fabulous and is high quality.But what I really love about this mirror is the hands free element.  It turns on when I get close to it and turns off when I leave.  Its fantastic for putting on makeup because you dont have to touch a thing.  The power source is great too.  You can plug it into a USB if you choose to.  I love this mirror."
1414,0,Just Not For Me_After using this product for 2+ weeks I realized that is just isn't for me. I had a significant increase in acne around the 'T zone' and some in areas where I never used to break out.Basically I look like a squash right now but my acne is already receding after not using the product for a couple of days.Lesson Learned: Once something isn't working..it probably will never work for you.
5466,1,"They all work amazing_The dark blue is the best. It shows up well on the waterline. The others need to be used on the lids, because they are too light. But they show up really well"
5384,1,"Lighten Up Your Base Color & Save Money_After spending many hours and money in some of the top Hair Salons in Beverly Hills spending over $300 per visit, I have finally found a product to lightly lighten my roots on my own. I still go to the salon to get my hair high-lightened but now I only go every 3 months. I don't use the product as directed. I actually put it on my hair at night before I go to bed. By the next morning my hair is a just a few shades lighter. Great way to save money and time."
2262,1,"Awesome stuff!_If you own a boat load of polish, this stuff is a must have!  Just as few drops brings old, thickened polish back to just like it's a new bottle.  Worth every penny!"
6697,1,Smells lovely and super moisturizing!_Love this product. It goes a long way too! I sometimes even clean my body with it for the moisture it provides. Great stuff!!!!
7078,1,Not what I was hoping for - but a good product._I was hoping it would work like the youtube videos I see. I however realize that this is no fault of the product itself which is very well made. It is very sturdy no matter how much pressure I apply this item hasn't so much as bent. So the product is well made but doesn't produce the results I was hoping for - this is not however because of the product itself.
3328,1,Gentle and cleanse well._A very gentle face cleanser. It works quite well for combination skin and doesn't strip the oil entirely. I have been using it in the summer and I'm sure it's great for winter also.
1177,1,"Wow...just wow._I held off for quite sometime before finally giving in and purchasing the Beautyblender. I watched so many youtube tutorials and reviews which stated that using the beautyblender gives the most flawless and airbrushed finish to your foundation. I was thrilled to try this product and did so the same day I received it. I used with Virtual Matte Foundation from Prescriptives and it went on like a dream!If anyone is on the fence about investing in these pink little wonder sponges, don't hesitate! Not only are they fantastic for foundation but the end with the point can also be used for pinpoint concealing around the eyes, mouth and nose. This was one of the best beauty buys of all time!"
1395,0,"Not impressed._I purchased this from Ulta. I enjoy a couple of MB other things, so gave this a try. I have sensitive, combination oily, acne prone skin. This product says you can use it on either cystic acne or small acne clusters emerging on the skin. I used it for two weeks straight on a small area of breakout on my face and didn't notice much of a change in my breakouts at all. I feel like I was just rubbing alcohol with baby oil on my face (the best way I can describe this stuff). I don't think it's worth the price, and I doubt it would work on cystic acne. I have gotten two cystic acne pimples last summer, so I get that rather infrequently, and can't comment on the product on cystic acne."
8234,1,Good value_Great price on these orange sticks and they are of excellent quality. I have been very happy with them and will order again.
8693,1,I love these._While I do love most of the Simple product line I would say I love these wipes the best.  They clean your skin without being harsh and leave it feeling clean and soft.  If you use makeup quite a bit then these would help clean your pores really nicely without leaving a residue or overdrying of the face.  The fragrance is nice and the price is reasonable which makes treating your face to a good cleaning a pleasure instead of a chore.
1482,1,Best file!_So in love with this file!! I also bought a mini one for my purse :) it us so gentle on the nails
4832,1,"I love Gelish!_The color is actually quite close to that pictured on the computer. Not to red and not to purple just a nice balance. I love the Gelish line by Harmony, it is so easy to work with and my nails always look amazing. I cannot tell you how many compliments I get!"
2745,1,"Just what the eyebrows ordered_Great for keeping my unrulies in line! When I'm feeling lazy, the best eyebrow combo is some brown eyeshadow, an angle brush and this bad boy.Not as great as some waterproof brow mousse options, but for a quick something to spice up your eyebrows...this is great.I don't use it on my lashes though. Alcohol=Drying out my roots and I have such baby lashes as it is..I don't need to upset them."
8045,1,"Restores Luster and Bounce_This conditioner is convenient, unlike other conditioners you don't have to keep it on your head for several minutes. It works quickly.It detangles, adds volume,bounce and luster.It also keeps hair smooth and full for a few days if you don't get the chance to wash your hair everyday.The fragrance is barely there, which I like. I don't really like a strong smell on my hair.I'm very happy with it."
7064,1,"Love this stuff great for hives and everything else!_I have had a serious sinus infection and I cannot use anything but baby oil and the Argan Oil body butter on my face right now.  Everything else hurts beyond words!  This is long lasting even through the cool touch tissues etc.  It leaves my skin soft but not oily or greasy and it LASTS, there is a big one!  I would recommend this to anyone even if they were not ill as I am battling right now, I will continue to use it and recommend it to my many friends and family!"
2830,1,"I'm shiny!_Switching to Alterna Caviar Seasilk Shampoo and Conditioner has given me the hair that I thought I'd never have again.I get my thick, baby fine hair cut at an Aveda salon and have been using their products as suggested by my stylist for the past year.  And even though the haircut is good, the hair goes flat the day after a shampoo.  And it has no shine at all.With Alterna my hair is now shiny.  May I say that again just for the joy of it?  My hair is shiny!  And no longer flat and lifeless.Yeah!"
8606,1,"It does the job_My daughters have a cute little antique looking two sided make up mirror in their room and thought I should give this a try for myself.  First of all this would be perfect for a vanity counter top since standing and hunching over isn't the best idea.  Sitting and looking into it without straining would be ideal.  I like having some extra light during the early mornings when I don't have natural light coming into the bathroom.  You have several options; home, day, office, & evening with each setting having a different hue.  Since you have to plug this is, it's nice that you can also plug something else into it even though I haven't had to yet.  The 5x magnification was actually scary and I went back to the normal mirror setting.  Yes, it's plastic and isn't that appealing to look at but it has a function and does just that.  It would be nice if it looked good sitting on the bathroom counter, but it just doesn't.  If you don't care that it's a bulky plastic mirror then this is for you."
6928,1,"GREAT spray for strong hold in humidity without stiffness_Living in Florida... humidity is often an issue for hair styles. This spray is perfect for this purpose. It has strong hold while not making your hair hard. It does not get &#34;white&#34; or flake as a general rule.The only time I saw that occur was when I had WAY TOO much on but it was for a Halloween costume and I got sprayed with a squirt gun in the face and head. So... that was to be expected.For Dally use and touch-ups throughout the day, it will work well without showing build up. I only use this spray in humid climates."
1967,1,"still using it..._I use this from time to time and always work great, make my face feels better, I get rid of the black heads and leave my face feeling very soft. great product."
8257,1,"Fresh scent, effective moisturizing_I use this face lotion after I shave, in place of aftershave.  It feels nice on the skin and the scent is fresh and not overpowering.  I do have sensitive skin and I have not had any reactions or irritation from using this product.  It seems to provide good moisture coverage throughout the day.  I am giving it four stars only because it feels somewhat weighty upon initial application, but overall it has been working well for me."
7715,1,"Wonderful Product!_I love my AGPtek drill. The price was fantastic. I wish that it came with a couple of really good quality carbide drill bits, but that's ok, you can find those anywhere. THe ones it does come with get the job done very adequately. It works perfect!"
6838,1,"Awesome nail light and great seller_I purchased this product Nov 2013, and absolutely love it. I have saved so much money doing my own nails, and the convenience of being able to do them as soon as one chips is great. What a great light!  Works wonderful!!! and was in my budget. I also had two of the bulbs go out May 2014, I was lost without my light and could not locate any replacements online, so I emailed the seller they were so courteous and sent me two new bulbs, which arrived quickly, would buy from this vendor again in a blink of the eye."
2982,1,"smells great & lasts as long as you take good care of it._this is a semi permanent hair color, but if you have used the Sally brand which smells terrible, then get ready to be impressed with how lush the pigment is and how much better it smelled. I left mine on for well over the recommended time (60-90 minutes under foil) the color came out vibrant and lasted for weeks. In combination with a high quality sulfate-free shampoo & conditioner, you can take good care of your color and reapply every 4-6 weeks, or sooner depending on how intense you want it. My hair is processed lighter, so this color was easy to see the reward."
7916,1,LOVE_LOVE These....use them all the time. Got extra to go with the dotters and will add nail polish and remover for Christmas gifs!
1846,1,Great for clearing up problem spots_This product is great!I use it after i was my face wash!Great for just making your face look flawless!
9793,1,"LOVE!_The Refresh Skin Therapy Fruit Acid Gel Peel really works.  Really, really works. I've used a lot, and I do mean a lot, of skin products, which is probably why Refresh sent me this one for review, and this peel is simply brilliant.It goes like this:You thoroughly clean your face, dry it, and then apply a few drops of the peel, smooth it around, leave it for up to five minutes, rinse with lots of water, use a good moisturizer, go to bed, get plenty of sleep, and prepare to be dazzled.  It won't turn you into Cindy Crawford, but your pores will disappear, deep lines will plump up a bit, and fine lines diminish.  Your complexion will be brighter, and your makeup will not only go on more smoothly, you won't need as much, and it'll look a heck of a lot better.  I've used the peel five times, and I'm hooked.  My skin looks great, and I've honestly done a couple of doubletakes in the rearview mirror (glad nobody was behind me).There are all kinds of skin products on the market that claim to do what this product does.  Some do, some don't.  This one absolutely does."
7772,1,"Like it, don't love it_I have been on the search for the perfect concealer (to cover dark circles that I inherited - Thanks mom/dad), and have yet to find it.  I am not saying that this concealer set isn't good, but as a fair skinned person, I think they should offer a fair, medium and dark set, because there are some on here (a lot) that I will never use, no matter how tan I get.  So that seems like a waste to me.  As far as coverage goes, it gives me moderate coverage, but I have a few others that do better.  I will keep searching, have a few more to come in and hopefully I will find the perfect one."
3134,1,"Better than it's Ritzy Cousin!_This serum works better for me than it's ritzy cousin Kerastase Nutritive Oleo-Relax Elixer and I keep more dollars in my pocket too! Two pumps in the palm of my hand and massaged through damp hair before blow drying keeps hair frizz-free even the next day. It makes flat-ironed hair super straight and shiny too. ALSO when your ends are split and you aren't ready to cut them, apply a pump or two rubbed just on them and blow dry on high during your hair routine. It's an instant split end repair trick I bet you'll like but you eventually still have to cut them off :(Sometimes I wash my hair at night, massage two pumps of serum thru my hair, pull hair into a ponytail and bun on top of my head and go to sleep. In the morning I have frizz-free flowing hair. This product manages my hair, makes it tame and GLISTEN.Useful hints from the ritzy cousin's website which is for professionals. I haven't done ALL THREE AT THE SAME TIME!1. Use as pre-treatment: apply to hair before shampoo...I do about 15 minutes before shampoo and conditioner, THEN just blowdry hair and continue remainder of hair routineOR2. Use after shampoo and conditioner , while hair is damp, as a style aid ...our usual directionsOR3. Use after blowdry to add some glisteny shineI also find if I take the time to rub the serum between my palms a bit to 'warm' it up before applying it to my hair it seems to go farther and work better. Too bad this is difficult to find in stores, it's wonderful AND the ritzy cousin is between twenty-five and thirty two bucks - EEK!FYI...Garnier Sleek and Shine Anti-Frizz Serum is yet another cousin from the same L'Oreal Corporate Family which also includes Redken, Matrix, Mizani and Shu Uemura. I guess I'll try Garnier Sleek and Shine when my EverPure Serum stash runs out."
9138,1,"Definitely recommend_I remember the first time I heard about BB Cream and thinking, 'I need to try that!' Then I did and it did absolutely nothing except make me break out. Buuuuut I still decided to give Pond's Luminous Finish BB Cream a chance and I am so happy that I did!Pond's BB Cream is light enough that I can wear it when it's warm out and moisturizes, so I can wear it when it's cold as well. It blends well and covers most of red spots and the occasional odd skin discoloration that always seems to happen at the most inopportune time. I still use powder over the BB cream, but I don't have to use as much concealer or foundation (which always seems to make me break out).I'll definitely keep buying this product, as it works well with my finnicky skin and is a quick fix."
4279,1,"Effective low-humidity moisturizer for Afro-textured hair!_I use Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie as a moisturizer in low-humidity weather (it contains glycerin) for my super dense, Afro-textured hair. Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie is a thick, super-moisturizing cream chock full of nourishing ingredients that smells like a tropical paradise.To moisturize, I apply leave-in conditioner and then Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie on freshly washed and conditioned hair. After air-drying, my kinky, coily, Afro-textured hair is moisturized and soft.A little of the Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie goes a long way so the 12 oz jar lasts a couple of months. I purchase it at Target or Walgreens. It's natural, affordable and effective so it's a staple in my hair care routine.Ingredients: Water, Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Macadamia Oil, Avocado Oil, Vegetable Glycerin , Aloe Vera Leaf Extract, Silk Protein, Ammonium Salt, Neem Oil, Carrot Seed Oil, Sorbitol Esters, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B-5), Caprylyl Glycol, Essential Oil Blend, Tocopherol (Vitamin E)"
4639,1,So pretty!_This color is beautiful! I would like to say it's one of the best glitter polishes I have ever owned!
5412,1,Mild mask_This is a very mild mask. Your skin feels super soft and not dry at all after using. It's almost like washing your face with rice pudding. There is no strong chemical odor or anything unpleasant. I would say it's good for when you want a light cleansing mask. It doesn't do anything spectacular but it's good for what it is.
6685,1,"Wow_If you have not bought a bottle of sunscreen in a while toss the old ones and buy Banana Boat Sport Cool Zone Sunscreen. It is a spray type sunscreen. From the other reviews it looks like multiple applications might be a good idea, however  I live in the mid-west, applied a few times when out in the sun for very long, and my experience is that it goes on easy, smells ok, and prevents a sunburn. I would buy it again."
6276,1,"Doctor recommended it_My doctor recommended it, I have some severely dry skin, especially in Winter. I've tried a lot of different soaps, Ivory made me smell like someone puked on me... natural homemade lye soap made me smell like doughnuts, not good for a fat guy, I was always craving doughnuts and the cat seemed more interested in eating me than usual! This leaves me smelling just simply clean... the way I like it!"
3789,1,"Can't beat this cleanser especially for the price._This cleanser works as well, if not better at removing makeup at the end of the day as my Est&eacute;e Lauder cleanser that cost 3 times as much.  This sensitive skin formula cleans without irritating my skin, and doesn't overly dry it out.  I also love the little scrubber that is on board as well.  It really makes your skin feel very clean, and invigorated after using."
8818,1,"works best with the conditioner_This shampoo lathers up soooo thick and luxuriously.  I loved the conditioner and thought I would buy the shampoo as well.  In my experience, the shampoo works best with the conditioner.  It does make my hair feel less weighed down, but it seems to make my hair a tad bit frizzy.  When I used it in pair with the conditioner I didn't have this problem, but I've tried it with two other conditioners and it isn't as ideal.  It feels like it really cleans your hair and washes free of residue.  The shampoo smells amazing and the packaging of course is nostalgic and GREAT.  My only suggestion is to make sure you buy this as a pair."
2137,1,Favorite OPI colour_This photo is obviously incorrect. The true colour is a more dark metalic lavender. I can never get enough of this polish.
7749,1,"Delivers on its Promises_The L'Oreal Revitalift delivers all that it promises. The moisturizer is thick and creamy, has a great scent. A little goes a long way. 1.7 oz is more than it seems like.I look forward to using this in the winter. It's quite thick, and dry skin during the winter months can be trouble. I am anxious to see if this works as well on winter dry skin."
426,1,"8_I do like this scent but using it to burn for home along with orange,do wish they made a home use for burning scent,"
8081,1,"Sexy Eyes!_Well I started looking for liquid eyeliners on amazon and bumped into this trendy liquid eyeliner. Its Elegant, Stylish, super convenient, product really good love it!! and its got a plus that is has a dark eyeliner integrated! The best part! The Diamond Crystal it has on the tip of the bottle! Yes Super Chic and totally good product for the price! in Love with it!-"
7198,0,"I didn't like this as much as I had hoped..._This foundation tends to go on runny, and looks very streaky once applied. The color of the makeup also is a bit too orange for my taste, but that might just be a personal preference. I usually like most Maybelline products, but this one was something of a disappointment."
9687,1,"Does a good job for the money_In my experience my hair looks softest and healthiest when I use salon brand shampoos and conditioners, especially those that are free of sulfates.  (To date for my thick color-treated blonde hair Kevin Murphy's products have worked the best.)  But when I'm on a budget or convenience-minded I've found the Dove shampoos and conditioners to be great for the money.  While the results I get aren't quite on par with the salon shampoos, they do a pretty good job of keeping my hair soft and healthy and without any build up or residue.Dove Oxygen Moisture Conditioner, 12 Ounceis no exception.  I feel that it more than meets my expectations, especially for the price.  The only caveat worth noting is I don't necessarily see a discernible difference between this conditioner and other Dove conditioners I've tried.  No matter which I use the results seem very similar for me and my hair type, but obviously hair types can vary so my results may not be typical.  But overall I think it does a good job for the money."
2954,1,Great set of brushes!_Perfect set of professional brushes for all your application needs!  Superb quality and I love the pouch they come in!  Shany is the best!
3659,1,It practically puts itself on!_This product is blowing my mind. I considered winged eyeliner to be a task that would always take 20 minutes and require multiple corrections with qtips to be presentable. Not with this!!! It glides on so seamlessly. Every day can be a winged eyeliner day!
1348,1,Great conditioner_I've used this conditioner for over a month and love it. Since I color and relax my hair tends to be dry. This has helped a lot.
3633,1,"A Better, Less Expensive Find_I am a beauty product junkie so I have used many different moisturizers.  But I fell in love with this moisturizer. I used Estee lauder before but lately I find that they have become too expensive. This is an awesome replacement. I have very good skin so I am not looking to lessen wrinkles or even skin tone. I need more moisture. I am African American, 38 years old and I get really dry skin in the winter. I can't say enough about this product. I think this is going to be a permanent switch...and absolute keeper!"
2288,0,"Made my poor nails worse_I have the worst nails, they're brittle, thin, bendy and break so unbelievably easy and I usually love OPI so figured I'd give this a go as I'm pretty desperate to attempt to fix my nails. It's been a little over a month now and well, this stuff has helped my nails grow sure, but they're even MORE brittle and thin then they were in the first place. I did keep up with it, used it every other day as recommended, but it didn't help strengthen my nails at all. I also can't take the strong smell from (what I assume) is the formaldehyde anymore, bleck, I should have read the ingredients better. So sorry I wasted my money, my old .98 LA colors nail strengthener worked better."
2681,1,"AGE SPOT IS FADING_This year I got my first age spot on my face.  All of a sudden it was there...a big brown blotch right on my cheek.  Unsightly.  I've only used this item a few times since I purchased it, and already the blotch has faded considerably.  I have not experienced any soreness, redness, itching or flaking where I've used it.  I'd say it is well worth the money."
445,1,"Bye-Bye Flakes!_I received a sample of this from another online retailer awhile back and I love it! The Intensive Formula is really rich so I use it at night like a repair cream, then in the morning I use the regular MLE Face Cream. Atopalm is great not only for people with sensitive skin but for those with sensitive eyes. Usually fragrance is the culprit in skincare products that irritate my eyes but even fragrance free ones have made my eyes water. Atopalm hasn't made me shed a tear! Love this stuff!"
715,1,Fabulous Scent_I enjoying wearing this perfume and more importantly my significant other likes the smell of it.  It is strong though so you really don't need to use too much.  That is a good thing as it will last forever!
2222,1,"Nice_I like this dye. I didn't use the bleach, just the purple. I'm currently redying it as I type this. It stains. Bad. Easily. It'll stain anything it touches so for pete's sake use some gloves and vaseline the heck out of your forehead. I've just been dying my bangs with this as of late on a natural medium brown color. It turns out pretty decent actually, given I didn't use the bleach. Nothing super bright but that's to be expected with medium natural hair. It lasted about 2 months before the very last of it washed out for me. Even as it faded it was a very pretty purple, with streaks of my natural color popping back through. I'd reccomend it."
2959,1,"Cant get enough of Shany_Well already have everything else, why not these amazing brushes. They are soft and super high quality. I love them, they feel like i expend a fortune but I didn't, and the case its super cute!"
9247,1,Want clear skin?_This product is fabulous because it works well for adults and teens alike. It has a cinnamon smell so I can even get my teenage sons to use it. We all have clear skin thanks to Diva Stuff.
189,1,Love Olay_I love Olay - I try other more expensive products and I go back to Olay.
1971,1,"Good product!_I like this because it pulls oil from my face very well, without drying it too much.Doesn't do it better and beyond what other products will, but for the price, its excellent."
6230,1,"I like it_NYX Mechanical Eye Pencil, Brown, Very pigmented, I like this rich brown eye pencil, I can recommend this product and will repurchase it."
656,1,Bald spot gone_I have about spot in the middle top of my head and I'm always looking for ways to conceal it sometimes I click in Hair extensions and other times a black permanent marker. this is good for on the go or a night out. If your brush your hair too much it will come out by if you're out at night usually don't do that anyway.
4334,0,"Not Good..._The brush is pretty big and normally I like big fluffy brushes, but this one was too stiff for me to work with. The worst part of this mascara was not it's performance. It lengthened pretty well, volume was OK. The worst part was that this formula caused my eyes to burn and water. Will not be repurchasing."
6378,1,"Good stuff!_I'm a St. Ives fan in general, but I especially like this lotion. It has a silky feel going on, and it feels almost powdery when it dries. There is a smell, but it's pretty natural (more like baked goods than perfume). I really don't have any complaints, and definitely no hesitation in recommending it!"
2529,1,fine to thick_I have fine hair and this shampoo makes it feel and look thicker. It smells great too. I recommend it to people with fine hair.
2289,1,"So far, so great!_I received this product just a couple of days ago, immediately put it on my nails, and I have already noticed a difference. It is a very smooth nail strengthener, that hasn't chipped or peeled at all, and has stood up to hand washing dishes. I am looking forward to seeing the long-term results!"
7905,0,false advertising_I would like my money back this. Is a poor nail tip I have had to reform many clients..loosing. Money is not the name of my game.  Very upset with this productAfter applying tips. On several. Clients each back with easily broken nails. The pinky. Nail would always crack when cutting down to size. Not good at all. I ended up doing double work and lost lots of money and clientsn.so dissatisfied .....
8088,0,"No directions_I've never used hair extensions, and these did not come with any directions so I was unsure how to use them"
1080,1,"Well it does say diffusing, not reversing ..._Unable to give highest rating as yet because I have not been using thislong enough to tell what if anything will happen with it; however, I putsome on and was chagrined to realize that I am still seventy."
1945,1,"Helped with Poison Oak_I bought this after my husband got into some poison oak and had the worse case anyone had ever seen. After buying every single item the drug and chain grocery stores sell I looked up itch relief on the internet. This was relatively cheap and boasts so many uses I thought it wouldn;t hurt to try it. It helped with the insane itching he had and also helped to dry the rash, something the other products had not succeeded at. I mixed it with the apple cider vinegar just as the directions say to do. I haven't used it as a facial mask yet but think I will one weekend when I have the time."
2234,1,"So Soft -- Best deal I've found_I'm used to much thinner cotton rounds, but I decided on this package because the price is so much better than a lot of other options on Amazon. 9 packets of 100 rounds for $30 means 3 a round. Even better, because they are thicker, I can use both sides of each round (giving me x2 the value).The packaging is convenient. The large box fits easily under the sink, the individual packages of rounds are easy to store on the counter, in the mirror-cupboard, or on the sink top. They are also easy to pack, though they are long.I use the cotton rounds every morning and night, primarily for wiping my face with witch hazel. They are very soft on my face, and each time I pluck one out of the package it's like stroking a feather for a brief moment.It's the little things that can make your day!"
6559,0,"Crap._I've been trying to stamp with these plates for months, and each time they come out blurry, or the imprint is too thin to hold the design. The designs are too shallow, so whenever I scrape off the excess polish, there goes most of the design, too. It takes me hours to do do one hand! Also, the designs cover maybe half my finger, they're so much smaller than the regular Konad plates. I can hardly get a full design on, and I have small fingers. It only fits fully on my pinky nail."
7569,1,"choice of love_It's great - and I use it also in the day, it's really soothing to my skin and a great feel.  I like neutrogena products."
5028,1,Five Stars_good price +good work
3528,1,Love it_My favorite and it arrived quickly.  I have purchased this before and I will purchase it again.  I love Vivite products.
3456,1,"How did I ever live without it?_If you're looking for a way to make your eye shadow last all day, look no further than Urban Decay's Primer Potion.  This product helps eye shadow glide on smoothly and stay on without creasing.  By the end of the day your eye shadow will look almost as good as when you put it on that morning.  The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is the packaging.  Even though it's super cute, it ends up leaving quite a bit of product in the bottle, which gets wasted.  I saw they came out with a new tube version though, which I'm looking forward to trying.  Definitely recommend this product in both the Original (which is a translucent color with a matte finish) as well as the Sin (which is a very pretty neutral color in a shimmery finish)."
5380,1,"It doesn't get better than this_I have been through so many different colors, brands, types of hair dyes and this one is now my favorite. I will never use another brand of hair dye. This foam dye is so easy to apply, I can now dye my hair without any assistance. The shade on the box is what you get and it's not patchy at all. The color is very vibrant and makes your hair look even healthier than before the dye. The conditioner that comes with it is a generous amount in a resealable container and made my hair so soft and smell great. I really couldn't believe how simple the whole process was, this really revolutionizes hair dye. And I have to add that this is the first at home hair dye kit I've used that came with gloves that actually fit me! I can't think of a single  bad thing to say about this product. I highly recommend it and I have already purchased and used again since my first time. Give it a try, you won't regret it!"
7265,0,clips don't stay on my hair. not happy_Purchase this for me. Does not stay on. Can't wear it. I love bangs but don't want to cut my hair so I order this bang wig but can't use it. Wasted my money.
7763,1,works_I ordered these for eyeshadow pans that i put in my palettes. You have to be carefull though cause these work for magnetized palettes only. If you have palette that has metal backing youll need magnets.
6133,1,Must Have_This is amazing...very sturdy and durable!  This is a must have that I should have had long time ago...this hold everything and is very eye catching....if you want to have your cosmetics organized and have that professional look well this is a must have for your vanity....
9877,1,it actually works!_Bought this to see if it actually works. I must say it DOES and its thick cream but not at all greasy. I have stretch marks from after having my baby ams this has actually lightened my marks I really have faith that if I continue to use it they would be gone forever!
5525,1,"Good Primer_I think NYX did a great job with this primer. However, I am not sure if it was the one for me. I feel like it dries my skin out a little and I was hoping for the same feel as the Smashbox primer but I think it left my face a little dry. I am going to try again and make sure that I put on enough moisturizer and give it another try since its the winter months. But I think it is a good product."
2561,1,"very pigmented_Im so glad i got this, they are cheap and really pigmented. I will be ordering more colors.  Good product. :)"
6134,1,Rhinestones come in variety designs all are same color_The package was compact. Affordable price. Item arrived within arrival date. Items are as described on the site. The rhinestones are small and just right for my small nails.
7175,1,"Bright pink color_Bright pink color, it stays on well even after trying to remove it you can still see it. It's an awesome summer color it's not a dry matte it in between creamy and matte."
8688,1,"Very convenient_These makeup removers are terrific.  They are the perfect size (i.e., small) for removing eye makeup.  They are very effective (my mascara comes off quickly) and, as promoted, they are gentle.  I have fairly sensitive skin, particularly around my eyes.  In fact, I have run into a number of eye products that I can no longer use because my skin won't tolerate them.  These pads, however, are indeed gentle and non-irritating for me.  The packaging is also the right size for travel.  Very convenient!"
6279,1,"sensitive skin_The only soap I use for sensitive skin.  It has a pleasant smell and washes clean off your skin, no residue.  I've used this soap for 8 years now."
9700,1,"Smells nice, leaves hair soft, full_I like this shampoo ok.  It smells nice - to some this fragrance might seem to strong but my family tends to like fragrant products.  It's a unisex, fresh fragrance.The shampoo itself is light aqua green.  It does not take much - a bit more than luxury shampoos but a bit less than most drug store brands.  The lather is VERY thick and rich.  The foam is tight.  It rinses out easily.The shampoo itself did not help much at all with tangles.  It left my wet hair feeling a bit too squeaky clean (stripped a bit?) to detangle easily.  This won't be a problem for anyone most likely unless they have very long, dry-ish hair.Dry, my hair was soft and had a lot of volume.  It gave my hair about as much body as some volumizing shampoos have.  I did notice some fly aways - but again, I was ONLY using the shampoo, with no stylers or conditioners.All in all, it gets hair very clean without weighing it down.  I do think it needs additional products to do a great job - IE conditioner and some smoothing serum.  It's very fragrant.  One can simply open the bottle, and someone else in the room will notice it.  We had that happen here.  We don't mind & like the fragrance - but some might be sensitive."
4229,1,Not meant 4 clowns_They give a nice variety of shapes.  I picked out my favorite and it's the only one I use. Just be sure to wipe it off before and after each use.  That way you don't make a mess on your face.
1899,1,Miracle Worker_I absolutely love this product it smells amazing. It isn't liquids. The consistency is perfect and it has erased 80% of my acne scars that were very dark along with some small blemishes in a month of using this & Dr Bronner's Castille Tea Tree Soap. SunKissALba on YouTube recommended these products and I am satisfied with the results. I definitely recommend this product.
8553,1,"Something banal becomes beautiful_As much as women have already said they loved this fragrance, a male friend was visiting when I opened up my Dove soap. Immediately, we  reacted to the scent with delight. It is a bit floral, but like a gentle breeze, it carries the fragrance into your awareness without overpowering you. In addition, the next morning when I went to brush my teeth, I noticed a very subtle aroma of fresh flowers and fruit emanating from this bar. That's a lot of pleasure to derive from a very basic product. Kudos to Dove for making something banal beautiful.The actual soap provided a soothing, rich lather and left my face feeling soft and clean.I have always been quite thrifty about essentials like this, thinking they're fairly interchangeable; however, Dove's bar has made me reconsider. I would actually purchase it again for the delicate scent and its creamy suds.UPDATE: I did buy this soap again only to realize how much I dislike the creamy mess it makes all over my sink.  I am taking one star away from my initial review and recommending you buy the body wash with the same scent, instead."
4508,1,Great Volume_This mascara volumizes very well and it's somewhat buildable. Coupled with a fiber mascara I truly get the false lash effect. It lasts all day with no smearing or flaking. I love it!
3336,1,"Best Violet Shampoo Ever_I have blonde hair that tends to go brassy and/or orange at the slightest provocation. That said I've been on a quest for the best violet or blue shampoo and conditioner out there for over a year now. Blue Malva by Aveda was the best I had found to date, but in the last six months I've developed a serious allergy to hair dye and anything with sulfates or parabens in it. So buh-bye to Blue Malva, which is not completely sulfate free.During a search on Amazon for sulfate-free shampoos I saw this product and decided to get it, comforting myself with the thought that even if it was way more than I usually pay for shampoo and conditioner it would at least not be bad for me. I purchased both the Pure Light shampoo and conditioner, and tried them immediately once they arrived. After drying my hair I was overjoyed to find that it left my mane shiny and bouncy and nearly the white blonde platinum color of my childhood (or when I used to suffer two hours of bleach fumes and pain). This stuff really works, and by really I do mean that any shade of orange and brass was killed off immediately leaving only the good stuff behind.I now faithfully use this combo four times a week along with John Frieda Sheer Blonde Go Blonder Controlled Lightening Spray (also not heavy on chemicals) on the roots whenever they start to get too dark. And voila! I have beautiful platinum blonde hair with a few dark blonde streaks in it and no burning scalp and eyes. My husband loves my hair too and says it's never looked healthier.Things for other users to keep in mind is that I was already a light blonde with hair that's going white underneath, so platinum blonde was already in the cards for me. It's just that this sped up the process rapidly without having to use hair dye and bleach and suffer through more allergic reactions. I will definitely buy more Pravana products, heck I might even buy stock in the company if it comes to that."
9599,1,Leaves Hair Clean and Fresh smelling._I loved this light weight leave in conditioner. It de-tangles and leaves my hair clean very manageable and fresh smelling.
9417,1,"I found myself wearing less and less makeup because my skin tone had improved_Belitae Organics Fresh Vitamin C Serum is said to restore, refine, and brighten skin of all types. I feel the product definitely makes my skin look more youthful and it evens out my skin tone. I really appreciate that the Belitae products are not tested on animals and are free from harmful chemicals, parabens, phalates, synthetic colors, fragrances, and unnecessary fillers.It didn't take many applications (2-3 drops twice daily) before I saw results. My laugh lines were less pronounced and I found myself wearing less and less makeup because my skin tone looked more 20something than 30something. Thanks Belitae!"
1838,1,Great oil_I used this oil in my shampoo and have noticed a huge difference! my hair is softer and smoother now.
759,1,"light, fragrance-free, great!_Found this at the Dollar General. I never tried a gel or FOTE before, and so I got this and the vit e cream. This gel is terrific. I was desperate for something light, not tacky that wouldnt make my skin feel like it was sticky and melty. Well, I'm so glad I took a chance! No fragrance, super-absorbant, light, adds just enough moisture without that 'humid' feeling. I wish larger stores carried it but if DG decides not to, I'll order from here. This is a new favorite."
6450,0,"juaz sells fake product - from China_This  product is sold by juaz is fake. OMG, I am so upset that my money and effort was waste. Ladies please be aware, I love this product and cant believe I wast my precious $$$"
9342,1,"Lash-tastic_I bought this stuff on a whim because I'm a sucker for anything that promises me thicker, longer lashes. After using it for just a week or two, my eyelashes are noticeably thicker (not sure about longer, hard to say). My only complaint is that it stung like crazy the first time I used it because I got it in my eye (not the fault of the product....total user error). Just don't stick the stuff directly INTO your eye and you'll be fine ;)"
4433,0,Hate!_The colors are not bright even with primer.  I thought primer would help enhance the pigment.  I guess you get what you pay for!
9083,1,"Made my hair feel new again!_I love any kind of leave-in for my hair. I frequently use heat styling, so my hair can take considerable abuse. This Pantene product made my hair come out smooth, tangle-free and very shiny after drying. I used three drops on wet hair, and there was no oily feel when I was finished. I'm quite satisfied with this Pantene Heat Potion Serum. I think it will be especially good to use right after color application!"
1697,1,"Best product to protect hair from heat_I was introduced to this product by my hair stylist.  After towel drying your hair, rub the product into your hair, then blow dry.  It's light weight and doesn't feel sticky or cause build up.  Also, it has a great, fresh smell, that isn't overpowering. I have to constantly blow dry my hair, and this kerastase product does an amazing job of protecting my hair from the heat. I've been using it for several years and have not found a product remotely comparable."
9521,1,"Great product, just like in the salon_I got this product because I loved the smell of the awapuhi ginger shampoo, conditioner, and hair whip that my hairdresser always uses on me. Their salon sells those products, but at 4x the price of this one!  The first time I used this shampoo together with the conditioner, it smelled as heavenly as the salon brand and worked just as well at considerably less the salon price! I didn't need to use a lot, a quarter-sized circle of shampoo was enough for my shoulder-length hair. It sudses up real well just like any regular department store brand. The smell also stays on longer in the hair than other shampoos I've tried that are more expensive than this. This is great for daily use as it cleans well, is gentle, very economical as you don't need a lot per use, and smells like you just came out of the salon. I think this will be my daily shampoo from now on."
7096,1,"Better than an expensive dermotoligist facial peel_I have done many expensive face peels at the dermatologists office and saw very little or no result for my melasma and dark skin discoloration. It was so bad that i looked like a raccoon and my upper lip was very  dark in discoloration( it looked like i had a mustache, but i don't). This was the only product that not only got rid of it, but my skin was renewed and softer looking after only 3 treatments. Whatever you do be sure to follow the directions and only use 1 or2 times a month so your skin has time to fully regenerate otherwise it will burn your skin to the point where it will look like you got leaporacy or partly burned badly on your face. Make sure to use post op face peel ointment after treatment"
8566,1,"Pretty_This lip gloss is so pigmented it shows up so well and last really long, NYX so far is the best, I own MAC lip glass and it last longer than itGet it you won,t be disappointed"
777,1,"Excellent flat iron spray_This is a very good flat iron spray that allows my flat iron to glide through my hair almost effortlessly. Most other straightening sprays I've tried have a bit of stickiness to them, and I was skeptical, but it does a nice job & leaves my hair shiny. I do small sections at a time, lightly mist and and then flat iron it-- it's that easy and it even has a nice smell. The smell doesn't linger for long, though, so you don't need to worry about it clashing with your perfume. One can goes a long way so it's a good value, and it helps to minimize the damage you can do with heat styling. If you're noew to flat ironing your hair or just looking for a new spray, this is a great one to start. I highly recommend it."
8810,1,I love this mirror!_This mirror is a work of art and looks beautiful on my vanity. I love the weight of it...so sturdy. I also love that I can place it just where I want and don't have to worry about a cord.  I have had many different mirrors since I was a teenager and none compare to this. I am 66 years old and I was pleasantly surprised that my skin looks really good for an older woman. How could I not love it after that?
6723,1,Looks really good over a dark color_This looks so awesome over black nail polish. All of the colors come alive and sparkle! I get lots of compliments when I wear this over any dark color.
4432,0,"Not great_Had issues with item, case is very cheaply made. I am not very happy with this product and there is no way to contact seller with any issues. Order with caution."
6302,1,"Good for thin hair!_These are good for people who have thin hair, they don't slide off.  Wished Goody would offer a smaller size slide proof ponytail holders.  Also, after using them a few times, they stretch out.  So far they are the best ponytail holders for thin hair unless you can find the original goody ponytail holders with the metal seal."
6672,1,"Great Product!_My family used this sunscreen during our trip to Florida this summer. We came back with nice tans but not a single burn.I've continued using it. It isn't greasy, the way many lotions are. It feels good on the skin. The hydrating factor is a definite plus. I'm prone to dry skin and this product has helped keep my skin soft.This is another in a long line of great Hawaiian Tropic products. And it's got that great summertime smell!"
1198,0,Complete BULL_Went through all of this for friggin 60 days.....absolutely nothing !!! most these great reviews must be shills/fakes...
6211,1,"Love this bag!_I really love this simple makeup bag!  It's a great size, has a great feel, I love the side pocket and being able to look into it.  I was worried that the plastic would be too stiff but the opposite is true.  It's a very soft plastic."
4769,1,"I am pretty impressed with this straightener_I was a little hesitant about trying this straightener, but I'm so glad I did. I've been using a very expensive Sedu for the last couple of years, and was pretty satisfied with the results, but when I decided to try this one, I was surprised at how well it works, especially for the price. This heats up much quicker then the Sedu straightener, which cuts my time in half. I think that's the most important thing to me. When I'm trying to hurry out the door, and I have to put an extra hour aside to do my hair, it get's aggravating. With this straightener, I was out the door in about 20 minutes. It does a great job with straightening my hair, I just hope it lasts a long time. I've already had to replace my Sedu straightener twice, and that gets pretty expensive.So even if I have to replace this one, it won't cost me as much. So far this works great, so I'll repost if it breaks down."
5766,1,hey_it works good its soft and adorablely soft if its a word so yea my sister bought it and she loves it
6757,1,"Beautiful summer color and great service!_The nail polish didn't arrive on the estimated date and when I contacted the seller, I received a reply immediately and it came the next day. This color is a very pretty coral red that's great for the summer and one coat is just enough."
929,0,"Doesn't work- Save your money_I bought this with the Bed Head Recovery Shampoo/Conditioner set. I added the TIGI S Factor Smoothing product because of the great reviews. I wanted something to limit fly-aways and add softness and shine to my hair. I blow-dry and flat iron my hair daily.(I have straight to wavy hair that is dyed and 50% gray)I found that when I washed with the Bed HEad shampoo and conditioner and did not use the TIGI S Factor Smoothing product, my hair looked and felt better to the touch than when I used it. It didn't help with styling, frizz nor did it make my hair look healthier.The shampoo/conditioner alone work wonders- my hair looks and feels better than with any shampoo/conditioner combo I've ever used.Other reviewers said this smelled great. I didn't think so. I was okay- not OMG Amazing or anything like that. Again- the shampoo/conditioner smelled better by themselves.So that's my feedback- don't waste your money. This stuff isn't worth it."
9899,1,"Really like this shampoo_When I first got this shampoo I thought it would be very thick and gritty. I was also a little nervous about the smell that it may have during and after use! Also, I feared that my hair would be really stiff and stringy after using it.Since, I thought it was going to be so thick (like a paste....is what I thought)....I started to pour quickly into my hand and I was VERY surprised as it poured out! It was nowhere near as thick as I had expected and the amount I poured into my hand and used was really more than I would have needed!So it really is not gritty at all and it is pretty thin! The other concern I had about smell......the smell was NOT gross. It was actually scented, almost perfume-y (is that even a word...lol) The scent was a little stronger than I would normally like but after you rinse out the shampoo....the scent is not too strong and it isn't bad at all. The shampoo did lather really well!Once dry and brushed.....my hair is not stiff or stringy at all! On the contrary actually, it is very soft and has a beautiful shine! I love this shampoo. I am happy with the outcome and I would recommend it to anyone looking to try something new!"
9660,1,"Worked well but consistency may not be for everyone..._This product has a very unique feel and consistency.Most of my night time moisturizers are creamy and it is easy to believe that you are getting the proper mositure.When I first used this product, I missed that effect.  However, after using it for a bit longer, I discovered it did do the job and my skin felt moisturized and looked hydrated.Long term effects will continued to be assessed.It would be such a boost in day and night moisturizers if they were all contained in tubes.  This would ensure efficacy and earn a fifth star."
8537,1,"Hair Looks Great, A Bit Gunky_Tresemme Platinum Strength Shampoo and Conditioner have a very mild aroma and help my hair look great.  I noticed just a bit of gunky buildup after using these products, but I still would recommend them based on the results they provide.  I don't think they really make your hair dramatically stronger and healthier, but I did notice some boost in those areas."
7664,1,"lo adoro!!_esta base es la mejor, no solo proteje la u&ntilde;a, ademas la deja lista para que el esmalte de color deslize perfecto y al final el brillo que deja ... es de lujo!!"
5768,1,"A great bargain_Ive struggled to find good quality brushes that are also affordable, and I have to say Im really pleased with this new line. This brush has so many different uses that im asking for more! I use it to apply my liquid foundation and it leaves it flawless. I also use it for bronzers, luminizing powder and for cream blushes, all with excellent results. Im definitely buying the whole line"
552,1,"Good._I got what I expected so I'm happy with this product. There are lots of choices so, shop around for the best price and quality."
5075,1,"hard to find_Where I live these barrettes are hard to find, so I was pleased to find them here. They can hold a lot of hair and they open and close easily."
5756,1,Four Stars_Awesome!
2424,0,ZERO STARS IF POSSIBLE_I would've given it 0 if I could have. Once it's out of the bottle it doesn't even have a rose scent and it has an after smell that made me want to puke. Returning this ASAP - thank heavens for Amazon Prime.  NEVER again will I order this brand ... warning - save your money and don't order this!
8298,1,"Wow, Suave..._In the recent decade, I've become something of a shampoo and conditioner snob, almost to the point of actually buying stuff from salons.  I'm not sure what level that puts me at, but Suave is something I often snub my nose at.  But with their recent lines clammouring to be noticed, well, I gave it a shot.And here it is:  this is one incredible conditioner.  I've been trying various masks (which are supposed to be the superultramega conditioning) and I'm now thinking, why not just use this?  The result is soft hair that lasts for several days and that doesn't even seem to be this conditioner's selling point.As for the selling point:  the shine.  I went into that test with a supersilicious grin... but I was once again surprised.  When used in conjunction with the shampoo, this truly does make for a healthy and fun glow."
5393,1,"It's a cute set._It's a cute set,including many useful skin care products.It is very useful in winter.I will buy it again after I used it."
1962,0,"It doesn't work for me_I think it depends of each one, for me it wasn't effective at all. I didn't feel anything and I didn't see any change in my skin."
3727,0,Awful_This has to be one of the worse products I have used. First off the consistency is like no other..it is very thick like Elmer's glue....even the way it smelled reminded me of glue. I used this on my daughter's hair and it being so thick it did not penetrate at all and just sat on top of their hair and it took me forever to rub it in. I looked at the ingredients on back and the main one is mineral oil which explains a lot.
6784,1,Love_I have dry blonde brittle hair ... I'm trying to grow to my mid back . I am 39 and swim a lot . I started sleeping in this not really thinking it would do anything but the next day after I wash it out my hair is alive and shiny and feels sooo good !! Def will keep in my regimen. This was great price though ill probably just buy at Walmart now .
9595,1,"Nice and light; not enough for damaged hair_I have dry, damaged, middle-aged, colored-for-forty-years hair, and I need to use an (in-shower) conditioner daily.  I really enjoy this leave-in, but I still need the in-shower conditioner.THE GOOD:+ I love the smell.  Not overpowering but pleasant, with a trace of the tea-tree oil.+ Not heavy or greasy.  At all.+ In the winter it helps with my yucky flyaways.  I assume that in the summer it will help with frizz.  And chlorine.THE HMMMM:- When I use it alone, without an in-shower conditioner, I have knots and tangles and my hair is just not moisturized enough.  When I use it  after a shampoo-and-condition, it does make a nice adjunct, but it isn't enough by itself.BOTTOM LINE:A nice light leave-in, with a nice smell.  Perhaps not enough for you if you have very dry hair."
7386,1,Love these_So hard to find matching combs in stores these days. I was so glad to find them here. I use them several times a week. The price was good and they are the perfect size.
1563,1,"Watch the Price_These is a great product for naturally curly hair - HOWEVER, watch the price.  If it's over $18 just go to the store and pick it up.  If it's $15 and on Prime Shipping then it's worth the purchase.I do not recommend the Deva daily conditioner but I do like the shampoo."
3820,1,"Wonderful_I had been using the Coastal Scents cream concealer palette for contouring before I saw this item. The cream worked well but this palette is so much less time-consuming and cleaner to apply. I use four of the six colours on a regular basis. The powders are smooth and blend great, and the cakes are huge! Favourite recent beauty buy."
4764,1,"Wow Awesome Mascara_I actually threw away my other mascara after I applied this last week, it's awesome and I can't see me buying any other mascara in future.  First the wand is nearly perfect, small and cylindrical so it doesn't pick up too much product, and the tip actually is able to get into close quarters, like the inner and outer corners of your eyes and your bottom lashes without the mess .  Hint: NEVER 'pump' the applicator up and down before removing and applying mascara, just gently pull it up, there will be plenty of product for the job.  I place the wand at the bast and just give it a little wiggle then pull straight to tip a few times, this keeps clumps away and coats nicely.  You can add layers, I've only needed two, but to each their own.  It gives you the appearance of thick full lashes both top and bottom.  I haven't noticed any clumping, caking or smudging at all with this  product. It is, hands down, the BEST I've used ever and I highly recommend this to anyone.  I always say the true test of a product is if you would purchase it again, well, I will!!"
4155,1,"Wife loves it me too_I'm allergic to, well, probably everything in the synthetic world. Wife had to switch to this to help my reactions. These people mean what they say. NO fragrance, period. Wife is not entirely happy since her hair tends to be a little bit dryer but the trade off of scent for sanity brought health to the household."
8808,0,"On the Fence!_OK I read lots of reviews on this product and thought what the heck!I've used it for a full week. Applied it different ways. I see no difference. I really don't.I don't like the container. It's too small to put the product in and to use my Kabuki brush or another similar brush to pick up the powder. It ends up all over my table. That is a waste in my opinion.I have a few powders from other cosmetic companies that are easier to use, the product doesn't get wasted, and frankly my makeup looks better.I wanted to like this, but I just don't. For the money I feel the packaging leaves a lot to be desired, and most importantly, it should have made me look better!"
4659,1,"Love it!_Under eye concealer is mandatory for me before I will leave my house because I have genetic dark circles that never go away.  This is the first product I've used that conceals my bags with only one or two layers that is not greasy and heavy.  I even use it to cover other minor flaws on my face.  I do have to pat it in with my finger to blend, but that is necessary for all concealers.  Great buy if you're looking for a great under eye concealer/brightener."
4105,1,Perf_I love this product it is perfect for lining up i use a thinner brush but the gel is the best
4481,1,LOve Love Love !!!_I absolutly love this foundation. I wasn't really a &#34;make up wearer&#34; untill i started wearing this foundation. absolutly love. looks great on my skin.
5943,1,its awesome_my face is so smooth after the first use that i wanted to come here and give it 5 stars. my face right now is softer than it has ever been before in my life and its glowing. its like a salon type of facial at home.
858,1,"Very classy_It's so rich and soft, and sexy and most importantly it's not overpowering. The bottle is very big. It could last me a year or so to be honest. I wanna say that this is one of the few perfumes I love that a celebrity came out with. Most of the times they smell tacky or cheap or smells like there's nothing there.It's a flowery and citrus smell. But it's sweet smelling not tangy. I love lovely. I would not suggest this to any early teens though or children. It's a woman scent. But for crying out I'm 18 and I love it. So just try it out my opinion could be opposite of what you would think."
852,1,Chick Magnet_One of my favorite colognes. I get more attention from the smell of this stuff then most other colognes. Last a good long time too.
2570,1,"A must!_If you do nails and your ALWAYS designing, you need these ASAP! I love these so much, they work amazing!"
551,1,"Using for hair and skin_Love this stuff. I googled what pure forms of VITAMIN E oil there are and toco(forgot how to spell it) was one of the types. Also, medical pages I looked at described the oil as extremely thick and heavy and this oil matches the descriptions found on a few different websites perfectly. *i like oils in the purest, least diluted forms*.I add a couple drop globs to whatever im putting on my face, such as: face lotion & foundation. It helps my make up go on quite dewy and gives me a non oily glow on my skin and i also feel like i've been seen WAY less tiny little blackheads on my skin which I'd been seeing much more the last couple of months.I mix it with my face lotion when I'm not putting on my foundation.When I'm putting my foundation on I mix a little foundation with my usual amount of lotion and add about one drop (feels like a glob since its so thick) on the back of my hand and use a foundation brush to apply it.If your going to do blush and bronzer for a nice natural covered feeling go put on your pants of fix your hair so that it can just set. If you give it a few or couple minutes you'll love the results because your blush and bronzer will go on smooth and to me much more vibrant and noticeably... i think the nice thin layer of protection keeps it all from being absorbed into your skin leaving you with a more LONG LASTING and SMOOTH look :D.For my hair I added almost a teaspoon to my sheabutter and oil cream I made and also to my flaxseed gel I made. I plan to mix it with whatever I concoct for my hair since i cut a lot of dead ends off recently and what to grow out my hair as healthy as possible.So far I am loving my new beauty and hair routine and this product has played a great role in that!Would give five stars but it just doesnt feel riht"
4373,1,"perfect for what i needed_i did not order these for makeup. infact, i wouldnt use them for makeup, i tried with my foundation and it doesnt blend well. i use them for blending nail polish for my nail clients. does its job in that department!"
8379,0,Crap_Eh they are a lot smaller than I expected.. They work alright but not better than my brushes do. I think I'll stick to my brushes and give these to my daughter to paint with or something..
1764,1,"THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR SOFTNESS, but....._I think that this oil is GREAT for softness, but it WAS difficult to wash out of my daughter's hair. I have since switched over to the 'light' version of this product, which doesn't leave her hair AS soft, but it DOES soften her hair. Alos, this stuff STANK to high heaven in my opinion, so I stopped using it. The light version has a nice scent AND it leaves even MY hair soft. I have the kinkyiest of kinky afro hair."
3036,1,"INSTRUCTIONS ON USE!!!_This color works great to match my light brown or dark blonde wigs. This is my second tube. I bought the light brown the first time & had to improvise, as no instructions came with it.  I found these instructions & wanted to pass this along to y'all. Hope this helps.How to apply: Greyfree is best applied to dry hair. For best results apply very sparingly. A small amount of product is all that is needed to cover even the most resistant gray hair. Gently brush & roll color wand from root to end until blended. Allow to dry naturally or use a hair dryer. Brush & style hair as normal. All styling products & styling tools may be used before & after applying Greyfree. No special brushes or combs are needed for application. To remove, simply shampoo out.Great product. Good price."
7532,1,"Excellent Conditioner_It is so nice to blow dry your hair, and when you wash you hair again seems to be softer and with a healthier look.  The ingredients are the best for your hair I used it 1-2 times per week and the other days Joico Leave-In Detangler.  I wash my hair almost everyday or every other day."
3872,1,"Literally the best shampoo and conditioner ever_I have been blessed with fairly good hair all my life, but using this shampoo and conditioner takes my hair from good to great.  I had tried other more costly products (Aveda, Oribe, etc), but I've been completely wowed by this duo. I find that it gives my normally flat hair a decent amount of volume even if I don't blow it out myself. I'm also impressed with the softness and sheen.  Most other shampoos and conditioners tend to dry out my hair, but these do not.  They are well worth the money."
5968,1,Don't let the price fool you!_This curling iron is magnificent! I thought it would just be a lil cheap iron to use on the side but boy was I wrong. This iron worked so well I used it on a recent photoshoot and it did not let me down. The barrel is a very quality ceramic & it heats up very quickly. Very happy with this purchase.
1376,1,"Amazing_My stylists gives me a sample of this every other time I see her and it lasts forever!  First off, it smells amazing.  The smell stays in your hair all day long.  Second of all, it really works.  All you need is a tiny little drop no matter how long your hair is.  Rub it in your hands and apply evenly, focusing on the ends, and you have shiny, frizz free hair all day long."
3334,1,"I like how this shampoo works but there is more to it..._The is Deva Curl's gluten free shampoos and it works well without drying out hair and has a nice scent. My only concern (as with all conventional hair products) is although it's sulfate free, it still has some chemicals I would like to avoid. I will be exploring organic shampoos in the future to avoid unwanted chemicals."
3670,1,"Pretty pink/nude_This is a so nice. Its between a light pinkish purple but can come close to nude by using a thin layer. As soon as I got it, I wore it the same day. I am olive/caramel skin tone."
5305,1,"Favorite Sunscreen_We are spending our Summer vacation on Florida's Gulf Coast where the Sun is strong and the beaches are great. We  spend hours at a time swimming and playing in the water or on the beach and neither myself or the kids have had sunburn issues yet. Half of the time we are using this 'wet skin' product and we like it because it's easy to apply on wet skin - no need to rub it in - provides sunburn protection and it seems to no wash away easily. We do spray some more after a couple of hours following the first application, just in case.According to the statement on the container, the product is:- sweatproof, waterproof - I'm not so sure what that means, our skin is waterproof by design but, yes, this one does seem to stick better to wet skin than most other sunscreens we've tried in the past- hypoallergenic - my skin happens to be allergic to a lot of things to the degree that I can't use fragrant soap, wool fabrics or any deodorant sprays but I have no issues with this product- oil free - the skin does take a shiny appearance but I agree that if it's oil it must be altered in a way that allows the skin to breath freely; no discomfort- PABA free - I hope so- continuous spray - checkThe main sunscreen ingredient is Helioplex which, according to Wikipedia, provides UVA/UVB protection and it contains avobenzone and oxybenzone.Technicalities aside, we are happy enough to standardize on this product and use it on both wet and dry skin."
9802,1,"The Best Moisturizer_It's very light and it doesn't leave a shiny look. I have oily face and I'm very careful with the products I use, especially when it comes to moisturizers because I don't want my face to glisten. The serum doesn't do that, but it makes my skin feel very soft and smooth. It also has a long lasting effect. Best of all, you don't have to use so much. A couple of drops can cover my entire face and neck. Would definitely buy this again!"
8669,1,"Lives Up To The Hype!_I'm always trying new shampoos. I've used everything from the no frills to the pricey salon items I get at the hairdresser. Nothing seems to live up to the hype--until now. This might sound like a clich&eacute;, but I have to say that Tresemme left my hair feeling silky smooth. I didn't have the frizzies and fly-aways that I normally do. And I didn't have to use a lot of shampoo.  It lathers up nicely and I liked the scent. I may actually stick with this one."
1358,1,"Amazing new product_Who knew your skin can also have a conditioner that you rinse just like your hair. This is a quick way to provide more moisture to your skin. I also like the clean smell it has. My skin is softer and applying it in the shower and rinsing off is so convenient and quick. I also apply baby oil gel every other day on top of this treatment for added moisture. I truly cannot shower without it now, I'm hooked. What a great idea, thank you."
2291,0,Chemical laden hardener_I was disappointed in this product after I saw their ingredients.  Nothing but bad chemicals and Formaldehyde!!!  I bought the DeLore Nails organic nail hardener and nail polish dryer.  So much better.  Cannot recommend this product and will not buy again.
3428,1,"Good results_I was feeling lethargic much of the time and couldn't kick it. My B12 isn't low enough to require shots, but is on the low side. I decided to give these pills a try, based upon a family member's recommendation. I've had good results -- more energy for sure."
9485,1,"Quality Argan_This is real Argan Oil. It moisturizes my skin and I can immediately tell the difference after applying it. In addition to moisturizing your skin, you can also use this for dry hair or brittle nails and it will help with those too. It's a great product and it's all natural straight from Morroco."
3338,1,"The best_This is by Far the best shampoo that I have ever used and I have been around the block with hair products lol. It smells wonderfully clean, not strong at all. You don't get much bubbling with this one yet you only need a little bit to get the job done."
6830,1,Purchased as a gift_I purchased this for my sister she has very oily skin and so far so good with this one. I have purchased Conair products for myself in the past and still using them years later so this is why I decided to try this one and my sister raves that this makes her skin feel soft and clean.
2750,1,"A trick for getting more of this on to your eyebrows_Here's a trick for getting more of the product on to your eyebrows - squeeze the bristles and the product will go on to your finger tips and then use your fingers to apply it to your brows. You can get more of the product on your eyebrows this way. You can still go back and brush them afterwards if you would like. You have to work a bit fast as the product seems to dry quickly.Has this worked for my thinning brows? I have only been using it a week now so far and it appears to be working slightly. I will know more as time goes on and will update this review. I am not sure if this can grow new hair though I am sure hopeful as I seem to be losing my eyebrow length, which for me is hereditary. No one in my Asian family has eyebrows to speak of after they go to about the age of 30. Even when younger, they were very thin."
9227,1,"Use a walnut sized amount at once_With 2.82 fluid ounces, I had to remind myself to follow the instructions by using a walnut sized amount in one application.  I used this to style my girls' hair and it was fun.This product is about volume and one can do so many things to create different looks.There are parabens in this whip.  Parabens are associated with some cancer tumors but not proven to cause them.  Knowing this takes a little of the fun out for me, but I like it otherwise."
776,1,"Love it!_I was skeptical of the new technology, but my hair really does dry faster than with my old conventional blow-drier.  I highly recommend this product."
4361,1,"The original Curve... A classic fragrance and a 'steal of a deal'..._Curve comes out of the bottle with notes of floral, spice, and woods.  Definitely a masculine fragrance.  It finishes with notes of powder and evergreen.  Very pleasant and easy on the nose.  While their are similar fragrances out there, Curve offers a slight variation, making it slightly unique and pleasant.  Curve offers above average projection and sillage.  The longevity of the fragrance is also above average, lasting six (6) to eight (8) hours on the skin and even longer on clothing.Regarding the 'Wow Factor', for the price it can not be matched.  While not every time worn, but on many occasions I have received compliments from hotties (I mean the opposite sex - don't tell Sweetie I made that comment..).  It has potential.. Obviously, I am a fan.  The real beauty of Curve is the price/value and versatility.  The current rate on Amazon is a little over $25 for a large bottle - with free shipping.  Curve can be worn any time of year - maybe Fall works best - any occasion and day or night.The packaging is above average and I am digging the metal boxes - a little extra cushion if you keep and use for travel.  While the bottle is nothing more than average, I do like the clip prohibiting spraying unless removed.My final tally for Curve is 4.4 stars out of 5 stars.  I like it and recommend adding to your collection.  The fragrance is fantastic and for the money - go for it.. Be a leader today and change the world..."
5706,1,love this color_This color is sexy and classy at the same time. I use it often it's just gorgeous. Looks like the photo and is very bold. I need 2 coats to make it perfect.
25,0,"another flop_Alpha Hydrox might as well close it's doors.  I don't know what happened because twenty years ago they had amazing products for a cheap price.  Now they cost twice what they did then, understandable with inflation, but don't work worth a darn.  Yet another epic fail.  I am so disappointed in this product line.  I purchased several different products a few months ago and after finishing the bottles am still convinced they are absolute garbage.  They do not do what they claim but if you just want a lotion...here you go.  They are just like any other plain old lotion."
237,1,warm and comforting_This is my favorite. It smells comforting. I think it smells like there is just a touch of cinnamon and musk with woods. Just my guess. I layer it with Marilyn Miglin Magic. It's wonderful!!!!
1112,1,"excellent for that ghost look_There is some serious SPF in this stuff! Don't expect to get a tan! That being said, it's excellent. Doesn't smell like sunscreen at all. It actually doesn't smell that bad. I was worried about the fact it was tinted since sometimes it has a makeup effect, but it didn't.Stays on long if you're exersizing and sweating a lot. I had a nasty sunburn and put it on over the peeling skin (gross I know, I know...) but it didn't irritate at all."
6906,1,"Excellent except for the smell_Like other reviewers, I find this texturising spray to work very well. I have a lot of very fine, short hair. I use texturizing sprays too help manage my mane, which can get a little unruly depending on the conditions (e.g., moisture in the air, wind, etc.). I've been using this spray for a few, blustery days and it's working well. The hold isn't too stiff and lasts all day. I can do without the perfume smell; however, I have noticed that it doesn't seem to be as pronounced once it's applied and doesn't bother me throughout the day like some other products have. Overall I think this product is excellent considering it's about half the price of similar sprays."
3069,1,Works pretty well_This one does the job. Got it for a trip to France and worked well. Very compact to pack for travel
8567,1,My search is over!_Fantastic conditioner.  Love the feel and smell.  I have the matching shampoo and deep conditioning balm (the balm is the BEST)!
9096,1,Amazing cream_I have been looking for a eye cream I can use that was 100% natural since I have very sensitive skin and I am so glad that I came across this natural skin care cream. I apply it day and night around my eyes and also before I apply my makeup for the night. It brightens up my under eye bags and reduces any puffiness around my eyes! This has truly become my all time beauty favorite! I have already had my mother purchase it to help prevent wrinkles since she has began to get crow feet around her eyes. Thanks for coming out with such an amazing product! I recommend anyone and everyone to try this out.
9103,1,"Excellent Beauty Product!_After doing my due diligence and researching the ingredients of this product, I was ready to try out this advanced formula. I've used Salvere's Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum 2x a day (morning & night) to reach maximized results. I realize that as we age, some of us get more wrinkling than others. I've seen this around my eyes the most with more noticeable crow's feet. Sufficed to say, after using this product for over a week now, I have seen them practically vanish. I don't say that lightly either. When I smiled before, I would notice more skin creasing around the corners and bottom of my eyes. I'm very pleased to say that with this serum; I feel more confident when I smile. Point in case, just the other day, a lady at the grocery store asked how old I was...she was at least 15 years off...bless her heart. I felt extremely happy knowing that there are ways to grow older gracefully.I too, like another buyer mentioned utilized a special Tx roller to get extra benefit when using this serum. I had foot surgery which has left a long scar down the front of my foot. Moreover, I wanted to test this product in more than one area. So, besides my face, I utilized it on my foot as well. So far, so good! It has made the scar tissue much softer than it was before. I hope that it will promote more antioxidants to become boosted in this area as well. I know with continued usage, it should help to improve what it looks like significantly.Pros:-Great Results in 7+ days (it made my skin extremely smooth, soft, and touchably inviting)-Reduces fine lines and wrinkles (especially crows feet)-Minimized pores and tightened skin without feeling stiffened-Helps my natural make-up to go on better-Plumped up my skin within the under-eye area-Nice smell-Started lightening dark spots on my jaw line caused from previous acne scarring-Great Price-Great ValueCons:None reported. No side effects.About the Seller:I ordered my 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum sold by Sal Sol and made by Salvere on 7/11/13 and they arrived on 7/13/13...on time and neatly packaged. The seller also had sent properer verification as to when the product would be delivered and when it shipped. I also received additional FAQ's via email which is another bonus to speak on superior customer service.Recommendations:I would strongly recommend this formulation of Salvere's Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum because of the other natural ingredients and the pleasant experience I've had thus far!"
7862,1,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!_I started collecting Stamping plates a few months ago.  This was one of my first purchases.  I used two plates to a slot and have been able to organize all my plates by number.  I can not image having over 125 plates and trying to find a specific design.  It accommodates the Konad, and the Shany plates with ease.  I am also glad I purchased this larger case because I never had expected to collect so many.  Thank you!!!!!!"
1286,1,"The wrong color!!_I got Gargantuan Green Grape, and in the picture on here, the polish a dark green. I got a very light mint green color. I like it but I already had a color similar to this, and I think the picture is misleading."

3184,1,"Your skin will love this !!!_Ok first off I admit I am a gadget and product freak. I have been using the Clarisonic for about a month now and I can not believe the difference it has made in my skin.I mean  HUGE difference, where my sister said 'what are you doing to your skin it GLOWS' !! I am also using the Resurgence  Skin care line and will say  after using the cleanser and the Clarisonic  my skin feels and looks fantastic. I had a little bit of redness and breakouts at first ( and this was only on my cheeks) which concerned me as I did not have breakouts  even as a teenager, and thought it might be the Resurgence- but called them and they recommended I try it for at least 30 days to let my skin get used to the new products I am so glad I did!!I grew up on the beach in the days of face baking and at 50 was starting to see some sun damage, uneven skin tone, enlarged pores, white heads, blackheads  (yuk) etc etc etc. The fine lines are gone and my skin is tight and smooth and a light foundation goes on flawlessly. (Yeaaaa!!)I loved the Skin Polish that came with the kit but was so-so on the cleaners...It was a little pricey but after reading the reviews of the other brushes that rusted. I am so glad I got this. You will not be disappointed. Let's face it girls when we look good we FEEL good. ; )"
4354,1,Great product_I have been using this brand ever since my stylist recommended it.  I mix it with 4 oz of 40 developer. I love the fact that it is thick and does not drip making it easier for you to see if you miss any spots. I have dark hair and it gives me a golden blonde color. I would recommend it.
6785,1,"Great Hair Moisturizer_I bought this after observing my Indian roommate using hair oils on her scalp. It's fantastic. I stick it in a cup of hot water in the afternoon after my daily run to get the oil into liquid form.  Then I massage it into my scalp and the ends of my hair, clip it up into a bun, and then eat dinner.  When I shower, I only shampoo twice on my bangs, because they get oily faster if I don't.  Otherwise, this oil leaves my hair shiny and soft.  I don't even mind the smell at all. It's kind of herbal and pleasant.I'm Asian and have thick, wavy hair that frizzes.  If you use this hair oil, you can also use other hair products like leave in conditioner. BUT. Don't use any additional oils in your hair.  I usually put Moroccan Oil or Macadamia Nut oil in and it won't soak in because it's already saturated. You end up looking like an oily mess all day."
1583,1,love these._I bought these WITH my hot curler set because I knew I would use them. They work great to hold the hot curlers in my hair AND they work well to clip my hair to keep it out of my way. Good tool!
837,1,"One of a kind, Must own_The price has come WAY down on this item. But even when it was much more expensive, it was still a wonderful value. For the bottle will last a long time. And the cologne isn't overpowering the way most colognes are. Rather it is something more along the lines of pleasantly intoxicating. The scent itself is clean, but deep and inviting (the way the smell of a good, red wine would be). This cologne gets constant positivity when I wear it. Don't miss out."
9206,1,Hair Pin clip_All of these hair pin clips are ab solutely beautiful.  they are all heavy but if your hair is thick these are just what you need.
5561,1,"Say it with me now: 'Ahhhhhhhh'_What wonderful salts. I had been usingTired Old Ass Soak / Bath Salts / 12 oz.for the past year to help soothe aches and pains from regular workouts, and though they are also quality salts, a 12 oz. jar is nearly $23, which just got too expensive (I actually started cutting them with plain Epsom salts to make them go farther, but even that was pricey).I was looking for an alternative other than plain Epsom salts when I came across Dr. Teal's here on Amazon. What a find: the price is right at $5.99 for 48 oz., and the salts themselves are wonderfully soothing -- the infusion of oils definitely helps take the edge off of muscle kinks, and the minty scent is invigorating. Definitely a great buy!"
725,1,"good product_I like it. I got the Golden light color and its probably a little too light but the next one up looked too dark.  it gives really good coverage, almost too good bc it can look a little washed out.  But after an hour or so it seems to warm up in tone and look less pale.  In any case, its a nice matte finish so if youre looking for shine control this would do it.  I agree with the other reviewers, get some makeup sponges bc the one included is thin and using a fresh one each time is more sanitary anyway.  Good product.Update (May 2013):  ok, I tried the golden medium and it is still really fair. My next trial will be the golden dark one, which is strange bc my skin would hardly be considered dark by any stretch of the imagination. I just think this color line (the 'golden' ones, can't speak to the other categories) is just ridiculously light.  I recommend going up a shade or two to find a good color match. Overall though it is excellent makeup, very good for your skin, no silicones (as found in liquids), lets skin breathe, has sunscreen properties. What's not to like."
9871,1,Just receoved ths moisturizer and I already love it!_Opened the box and used it first thing --- I really like this product!  The scent is very light but MINTY -- I love minty!  It feels very nourishing and actually cooled my skin.  Quickly absorbed and not greasy at al.... very happy with this product!
3694,1,"This liner works well for me._I have been using this liner for a few months, and so far no problems. I also have oily lids as one other buyer mentioned, but for me this liner stays on until I go to bed. It isn't thick, but I like that. I sometimes draw the outer line, and then fill in to the lash, and sometimes do it in one line. The applicator allows more control than something that goes on thicker. I have not had any problems with clumping, but I to shake the bottle each time that I put the brush back into it. There is a little ball in it that mixes the liner liquid and keeps it from clumping. I am glad to see it offered on Amazon at a subscription price. This also saves me a trip to the store."
2752,1,"Love This Stuff, But The Smell Sets Off My Asthma_I love this stuff. When I first got it I used it on only one side of my face the first few times (I used it on my droopiest side), and the lift it gave to that side of my face was amazing. From that I was 'hooked'. Now I use it on both sides of my face and my neck twice a day (helps lift up the under the chin skin droop too).  I continue to use it even though the odor in it sets off my asthma. Since I have to do my inhaler anyway I try to time it to right before I use this serum. On my last order I ordered 2 bottles. I like the serum because it has a light, smoothe feeling, and still works as wonderfully as the cream.I do wish though that they had an unscented version. That would definately be 5 stars!"
5548,1,"Seems to work well_I like that this is an overnight mask and really seems to calm my skin down when I'm having breakouts of dryness from stress and allergies. It's not sticky at all after it dries and my skin seems to really need the moisture.UPDATE: So I used one of my usual lactic acid peels this month and it really burned my skin! Turns out in dry weather, chemical peels can be more harsh on your skin, so you have to be very careful. After a few days of redness, my burns were slow to heal. Well, on a whim, I threw this mask on one night hoping it would help and by morning, the burns had completely cleared up! The moisture was exactly what my burns needed. Now I use this mask after every chemical peel I do, even if it's very mild. I love this stuff! It seems to last a good while, and I will definitely reorder when I'm out."
2346,1,"Just What I Was Looking For!_I never write reviews unless a product is really good or really bad-this one falls in the REALLY good category for 2 reasons: It smooths out imperfections in my polish (I use off-white on the tips which is really hard to get even enough to resemble a professional french manicure) and second, it really prevents chipping. Normally after 2 days, my white tips are chipped regardless of what top coat I use-not with this-they last at least a week. I've even applied another coat to the tips and then the top coat again after a week to stretch out my manicure when pressed for time. Love the stuff! Did I mention that it adds a great shine that lasts as well? It reminds me of whatever they use at the salon; thick, shiny and gives a professional finish. I love it when I find a product as good as this! One last thing, it does dry pretty fast-no more spending money getting a professional looking manicure!"
4041,1,"Great for DIY toothpaste_I really wanted a toothpaste holder for my DIY toothpaste, but I needed something that had a wide mouth and then had a decent size squeeze hole which wouldn't leak. This fit the bill! It's awesome! It's easy to load the toothpaste into the container and it is so easy to squeeze it out from the container. It has never leaked and it travels well. I LOVE IT!"
7,1,Iron_This is perfect. It gets really hot and keeps the curl. It cam e really fast as well. I would say get one
297,1,"Wonderful Product Line_I've tried several face products and finally found Earth Science, which I have now been using for many years. It's hands down by far the best on the market.  Very gentle with all natural ingredients.  If you truly want to take good care of your skin use Earth Science."
7963,1,Taylor Swift Enchanted_Love the Taylor Swift because is has a sweet and floweriest smell. That is why I alike Taylors Swift's Parfume. Thanks you.
1206,1,"Great_I trimmed my eyebrows with these, there isn't much to write about scissors but all you need to know is that they cut well and have a nice solid feel. They're made of nickle though so for those who are allergic, beware. i am allergic myself, but i have had no adverse effects."
8587,1,"Surprisingly close shave_I tried one of the disposable razors years ago and instantly wrote them off as I did not get a good shave out of them. The Shick Hydro, to my surprize, gave me a very close shave. My skin felt clean and tight afterwards. I was impressed. I was tempted to give it 4 stars because I put more trust in a non-disposable razor as they have more weight and seemingly more control. I realize that this is a personal preferemce though and ended up giving this product 5 stars. It preformed well and beyond my expectations."
3439,1,Noticable difference!_Have been using this for few weeks now. Lines are much smaller if not gone. Slight burning at first but only lasted a minute and stopped all together after couple days of use.Very light not greasy. Great product!
8271,1,"Great product for the price!_This is my 3rd curling iron and by far it's the best, especially since it was 20.00 less than the last iron I purchased.What I love about it...* Heats up VERY quickly.  You basically plug it in and its ready in less than 30 seconds.* 20 heat settings.  This is important as the first time I had it on too high and when turning it down, it immediately dials down to that temp.* Comes with a stand which neither of my irons did.* Auto shut off.  It is pretty much standard now, but one of my irons does not have this feature.* Lastly, it seems to make my hair shinier, perhaps it is the titanium.The only negative I had was that I turned it off accidentally a few times.For the price this is an excellent curling iron, and the color is cool too.  Highly recommend."
8856,1,"It works_I have premature sign of cellulite and thus here is this anti-aging tool. The Mitt is very comfortable on hand. However, do be aware of the strength you use this mitt. First few days, I left marks on my thighs. Then I dialed down to gentle rub. Now it's been about a month. When I look at my back thigh, the sign of cellulite has gone. I think it's the mitt that stimulates the blood flow and helps the healing of broken cells."
2410,1,FANTASTIC!_Would absolutely NOT be without it!  I use this baby for just about EVERYTHING!!  From cleaning out edges of things I can't get out .. reaching goofy places I can't reach .. all kinds of things it was never meant to be used for .. as well as a cuticle instrument!I now would not be without it!!  Have repurchased it several times so I have one in numerous places around the house for various tasks never meant for a cuticle instrument .. even use it to maneuver vitamins I can't reach!  You'll find all kinds of uses .. just use your imagination!!
1582,1,Miraculous!_Who invented these?? They are miraculous! I have been using different versions of hot curlers for decades and have cursed the clips the companies provided when[a] the rubber tips fell off and the sharp edges dug into my scalp[b] I lost the correct size clips and had to try to force a smaller one to work[c] the clips stretched out over time and didn't hold well anymore[d] the clips fit but I just couldn't get the correct angle to make the curlers hold[e] my haircut was just a tad short to wrap the curlers enough to holdThese clips fit ANY size curlers. No searching for the right color tips or size. They grip instantly and painlessly and leave absolutely no dents or marks in the hair. They grip even when short hair is not securely wrapped all the way around the curler. These clips have cut my user time in half.The Amazon price fluctuates widely so pick them up on the down swing--or just hurry up and buy them. You won't begrudge the couple of dollars extra you spent. Who invented these?  What took so long? Probably not enough women engineers!!
7996,1,it is good_u get what u want when u get this i like that is comes with a acrylic bottle that dose not turn ur nails yellow..
1153,1,"Use To Exfoliate Well Before a Spray Tan_I love these scrubby little gloves. Besides using them every now and again as part of my shower routine I really purchased them to obtain super exfoliation before an airbrush tan (as recommended by a friend.) I hear the tan stays on longer if you exfoliate very well. In the past when I've gotten spray tans I've just used a loofa sponge. I was very pleased with the tan, it looked even, and it did last longer, a whole week & a half. I am attributing it in part to these gloves, but really, I'm just guessing here."
6020,1,"It really works_Like most people commenting, I bought this gel because, thanks to shaving and using deodorant, my underarms had developed a weird, greenish gray tint to them (gross!). After doing some research, this product seemed to be the best thing for that - it's also relatively cheap in comparison to some other products I've looked at.Anyway, I've been using this gel for a week and I ALREADY see an improvement. I am so impressed! Granted I use it 3x a day, which admittedly is a little excessive (once or twice should be plenty for most people), but I was eager to see if this stuff produced results and I'm happy to say that it does. I've used a little less than half of the tube now and the greenish gray tint has lightened considerably. I also bought the Xtreme Brite exfoliating soap to use on my underarms. I'm not sure if that helped or not but I love both products either way and will continue using both of them. I'm very happy with this purchase."
2475,0,HOPE IN A TUBE EYE_THIS STUFF IS VERY HARSH. TAKES SKIN OFF! BUYER BEWARE! I cannot believe this stuff is even on the market. Philosophy that is supposed to be the natural product selling harsh chemicals like this. Terrible!
6765,1,"Perfect for my application_I use these as a guide on my nails to make sharp, clean lines. I haven't really used them yet as decoration, but I will edit this review as soon as I do! For the time being, I am VERY pleased with the price, variety of color, and performance of this tape. A must-have for nail art junkies!"
9838,1,"Great for Dry Skin_I received a free bottle of this Rosehip Oil in exchange for my honest review but all opinions expressed are solely my own.I've heard of Rosehip oil in the past but this is the first time that I've actually had the opportunity to use it myself. It can be used on skin, hair, scars, stretch marks, nails, and more. Since I use Instanatural's Vitamin C Serum on my face and something else on my hair, I decided to try the Rosehip Oil on my dry heels, toenails, and knees.I walk around barefoot a lot so my heels get really dried out and cracked. It's embarrassing and just looks bad. I really want to wear my sandals and flip flops this summer so I wanted to make sure that my feet look better before I head to the beach. Several days ago, I started rubbing a few drops of this oil on my heels and massaging it all over my feet. I've noticed a huge improvement in the condition of my feet. My toenails even look better.They're not completely crack free, but they are looking better everyday. I'm thinking that by the time I'm ready to head to the beach, my feet will be so nice. Since it seems to be working well on my dry feet, I've also been using it on my knees and legs since it's pretty hot out and I want to be able to wear shorts and skirts without being worried about my dry, ashy legs.I really like this product. It doesn't have much of a scent. It comes in a good sized 4 oz bottle. It's an all natural product with no fillers---great :) It's rich in antioxidants and essential fatty acids.I love the dropper lid, so that I can control the flow of the drops that I want to use. You really don't need much.I also plan on eventually using it on my stretch marks.It arrived quickly and was bubble wrapped very well.Oh yeah, a quick note---if you are using this oil on your feet as well, make sure to be very careful if you're not walking on carpet. It can make the floor very slippery. Rub it into your skin and let it absorb. I put socks on my oiled feet when I go to bed so that I won't get it on the blankets when they're still wet and also because I think it helps lock in the moisture better on my skin.I store it in my fridge so that it will last longer. It also feels nice and cool when I apply it."
582,1,Good simple 5/8' curling iron_It's hard to find a good 5/8&#34; curling iron - it must not be a popular size.  Some on the market have the thumb release so high from the barrel it's difficult to use.  The Helen of Troy is simple but effective.  Easy on the hands and has 2 heat settings - I only use the high setting.  I've tried other curling irons with temperature settings and they just burn my hair - no need for all the pizazz.  Just need a simple curling iron that works well and this one does the job.  The cord does curl up on you but for the price not a big problem.  It gets hot quickly and does a good job.
1085,0,Dislike_I have curly AA hair. My hair did not like it at all; hair became dry and crunchy immediately after use! I tried on sections of clean hair as a rinse out conditioner after letting sit for 5 minutes.
8192,1,Worth the money_I bought this to hold my nail polish and it's perfect.  The top has individual compartments to hold compartments round polish bottles. The bottom has a large drawer that can hold almost anything.  It's a nice size and sturdy. Would definitely recommend.
8741,1,"VERY Potent!_I have used and reviewed Peter Thomas Roth Retinal Fusion for years. This is the highest non-prescription retinol available. Please note, this is not for individuals that have not used retinol before. If you do decide to start with the product-please do a patch test, use sparling and only about once a week initially.The most interesting thing about this product is the consistency. This is a very thin, clear serum-which is very different from most retinols. I suggest using a water based moisturizer on top of this.Over the years my acne scars have cleared, I break out less, and it has mitigated the fine lines that were beginning to form. On occasion, I have a bad reaction to this product and my skin gets a little read and flakey. I highly recommend using a good moisturizer and sunscreen with this product.Skin Type: 20-something, semi-pigmented, semi-sensitive, acne prone, a few lines"
449,1,Good product for migraine sufferer - no scent_This product works but the feel is not as good as Head and Shoulder brand. I use this to avoid the headaches I get with artificial scents - for that it works great. For anti-dandruff it works great. Just use a scent free conditioner after this product and all will be well.
5551,1,"Best nail polish E-V-E-R._Insta Dri is the best nail polish I've ever used. Not only is it easy to apply but it literally does dry instantly. I was famous for smudging my nails because I'd be too impatient for them to dry. Never again will I have smudged nails. My nails don't chip easily with this stuff either. I put on two coats of color and a coat of clear (all Insta dri) and it's magical how quick they dry. The clear is always sold out in stores when I go to pick it up, glad I can order it from amazon."
3066,0,Funny smell_I do not like how it smells.. Smells like something old like my grandma's makeup. I am asian and have a very light beige skin tone.I stayed under the sun with sunblock and I got darker.  My face got darker than the rest of my body.  I do not know if this product  is to blame but i had a hat on and my arms and legs which were pretty exposed did not get too dark. I'd give it a couple more days and see how it works..IF my husband doesn't complain about the smell.
6845,0,"smells way too sweet, gives me a headache_It's an OK product for defining curls but I can't get past the very strong sweet smell.It doesn't smell nice on my hair. I've tried way better products for styling my curly hair."
1740,0,"I  have purchased this item 3 times from Wholefoods based on it's fantastic initial fragrance._Here's the problem.  I spray it on and I can smell it.  I put it on all pulse points.  In less than 20 minutes it's literally  gone.My husband adores this scent so I did a sleepy time experiment.  He likes to spoon while we sleep so as I got ready for bed and I doused myself in Pacifica California Star Jasmine Spray Perfume; especially around the neck.By the time he had brushed his teeth and gone through his rituals and crawled into bed and cuddled up, I waited. No response. I had to ask him if he noticed any fragrances; he said not really; just  your shampoo smell.Something is wrong here.I sprayed this on my sweaters hanging my closet and when I opened the door to closet an hour later, I smell nothing.I have a great sense of smell.I'm going to experiment with jasmine essential oils mixed with a little orange oil and coconut oil.  I want to see if I can create something similar to this scent that will actually last.This is crazy. Perfumes are supposed to have a greater staying power than lesser scents. This has virtually none!"
5906,1,like it!_Shea butter has always been my fav. This one however is not so creamy! Don't know if it suppose tto be so.
7630,1,"Pretty scent, interesting selection, fun!_I bought these as a springtime kick-off gift to add to Easter baskets for my sister and Mom, and everyone instantly loves these! The scent is nice in each, and the package is a random selection of scents. The price is fair, and the quantity you get is plenty to have some for yourself and share as well! I didn't even mind a random repeated scent in the selection, because then I can share one I like already."
9618,1,Awesome!_My wife and I both use this moisturizer cream on out faces after our showers daily. It has helped with my majorly dry skin and has helped my wife as well. She has noticed more firming and her laugh lines are now less apparent. This cream is also easy to apply and has a great scent.
9218,1,"These work well!_I am a grandmother so not a young person and have very dry skin.  I do not wear much makeup but like to make sure I do get it all off and that my skin is truly clean.These wipes do that very well!  They really to remove makeup easily -- no scrubbing which is great for a 'mature' woman.  But for me, the best thing is that they leave a more moist feeling and not a tight and dry feeling like so many wipes.  In fact, most I've tried either leave your face very, very dried out or, worse yet, all oily so you have to wash your face!Nice buy at the price.  The scent is also softly orange and not overwhelming.  A big plus if using at bedtime."
4535,1,"Product is amazing-even with a lot of hair_I have a lot of hair, which takes over an hour to blowdry completely. My entire life I've searched for and used products, that would take away some of the fullness of my hair, or at least calm it down. It's not frizzy in a curly way-I just have a lot, which creates flyaways and 'flipping', in areas where I don't want it:) A system of shampoo, and some styling product to take some of the fullness out of my hair has always been important to my routine. This shampoo is a great start.It's smells amazing, is noticably creamier and smoother than other shapoos I have used, and washes out clean-very important for the thickness of my hair. I highly recommend using this-Pantene does it again!"
191,1,Really like it_I have been using this for years and really like it. It makes your face feel so soft after using it.
1329,1,"Expensive Luxury Soap with hyped claims, but a lovely product even so_Approached by the Cor Silver Soap company - purporting to use actual silver particles in their facial soap - I could not help but be intrigued. Silver, the precious metal, as a facial cleanser? Would one be able to SEE the silver in the soap? Would silver be a good additive, or just an excuse to charge untoward amounts of cash for such a novel product?As in all reviews I do, the proof lies in the testing. Cor helpfully sent me two small round slices of Cor Silver Soap to test. The small samples are considered a week or month's worth (depending on how thickly one lathers their face) of cleansing. I gave one to my mother to get a larger test sample than just myself.The Cor Testers:At 41, my skin is olive-toned, prone to getting dark freckles and evidence of hyperpigmented sun damage, but few wrinkles. I have normal skin with a tendency to get spot breakouts when I use products containing irritants on my face.My mother is 62, has light crows feet, slight nose to mouth lines, and very few wrinkles overall. She has lighter colored skin with blue-pink undertones, and also gets dark freckles in the sun. Her skin type is normal to dry.We each used the soap twice daily for a week.The Cor Test:We both found the Cor Silver Soap very pleasant to use. It has a light, barely there clean scent, goes on silky and washes off cleanly. This is a low-lather product, which I prefer in a face cleanser.Cor Silver soap removes the dirt from the day and most of the makeup, and doesn't leave us with that dry, tight skin feeling which we've come to realize means the skin is stripped. In other words, we felt comfortable, soft and clean. We both followed up use with our normal moisturizers. We did not experience irritation or breakouts. Wrinkles, though - sadly - remained right were we'd left them.Negatives for this product center mainly squarely on price point. As one would expect. A full bar of Cor Silver Soap at 125 grams will set you back $125. Our tiny 'cucumber slice' samples cost $14 each in retail. At either size, we consider that pretty darned expensive for, what is, in essence, a pH balanced soap for sensitive skin. Many lovely drugstore facial cleansers for perform the same task at a fraction of the price.The Reality for Cor Silver Soap:This is clearly an elegant formulation, presumably due to the silica, collagen and silk protein ingredients. The pomegranate extracts and avocado oil are also helpful ingredients - with antioxidant and soothing benefits respectively.Silver, the most salubrious ingredient on the menu, is an unusual choice for face cleanser on several levels ~Silver has been studied and proven as an antibacterial agent, as with most metals. But is there enough silver in the solution to approach antimicrobial levels? I can see right through the soap sliver and while it does have a mild metallic sheen, I cannot say just how much silver is needed to fight bacteria in a product applied to surface skin.In another vein, a cleanser is made to wash on and wash off. This isn't a moisturizer or serum whereby strong active ingredients are applied facially and left to soak in. Thus, having silver and collagen in a largely glycerin soap product seems a bit precious: how will something you wash right away (or even away after a few spare minutes, as they suggest for deep cleansing) encourage healing and cell growth?Cor's touted answer is that the active ingredients penetrate deeply into the dermis layer of skin. I would like to see studies proving that - from my research we aren't there just yet, and don't know exactly what the effects of such nano-technology are for the body in the long term.The ingredient Chitosen I have no issue with, as that helps provide a fibrous mechanical type of mild exfoliation, leaving skin smoother overall. Mixed with the silica and silk proteins, Cor really does offer a lovely formulation to cleanse, exfoliate and add moisture-binding ingredients in one pleasant step.The Recommendation for Cor Silver Soap:This a nice product for facial cleansing: with mild exoliation in a a non-drying forumla. It is easily rinsed, and matched with a very slight scent of lemon verbena and fresh melon.If this is what you seek in a cleanser, I'd suggest purchasing the sample size at $14 and seeing if you can't live without it. An expensive price tag doesn't always translate to a miracle product, so I'd take the claims of reviving, plumping, luminizing, brightening, toning, balancing and healing with a grain of salt. Or in this case, with a grain of soap!Validity of claims aside, the cleanser IS simply lovely to use and left both mine and my mother's faces fresh, clean, soft and fully prepped for moisturizer. If you don't mind the price tag, this may be the right facial cleanser for you, and you will certainly feel luxurious indulging in it."
7567,1,"Non-abrasive, nice smell_I have sensitive, normal skin.  My usual routine isEstee Lauder Perfectly Clean splash away foaming cleanser 4.2oz/125mlandESTEE LAUDER by Estee Lauder Perfectly Clean Fresh Balancing Lotion--/13.5OZ for WomenwithOlay Complete All Day UV Moisturizer, SPF 15, Sensitive Skin, 6 Ounce (Pack of 2).  I tried this product to compare results with a cheaper alternative.  I used it with my normal toner and moisturizer.  I use the more expensive Estee Lauder products because they're basically the only products I've found that don't dry out my skin and make me break out.The liquid is thin and doesn't lather much, but it was easy to use.  I had to use two pumps to get cleanser enough for my whole face.  There was just a slight tingle.  There's a bit of a scent, which I found pleasant.  It's not fruity and didn't linger, so it probably wouldn't bother people with sensitive noses.  The cleanser didn't cause a rash or hives, so most people with sensitive skin should be fine using it.  It does contain glycerin, so avoid if you're sensitive to that.I'll report back after I've been using it for a week or so to give more detail.  So far it seems like a good deal that works as promised."
9224,0,"Better to Use a Washcloth_First off, to compare the Revlon against the Clarisonic is simply not fair - the Clarisonic that I owe beats this Facial Cleansing System into the ground.  However, compared to other drugstore facial cleansing system, the Revlon still falls short.  The power on the unit simply isn't strong enough to do much for the skin.  Many of the attachments aren't really useful.  When it comes down to it, it is more beneficial to use a washcloth than this system.In terms of durability, the Revlon isn't built to last.  The unit has a cheap feel to it, and I can't imagine it lasting much more than a few months with daily use.  If you're considering getting a facial cleansing system, but don't want to spend a lot on a unit, you may be better off getting an Olay cleansing system.  If you have a bigger budget, I highly recommend the Clarisonic.  Not recommended."
6061,1,"SUMMER COLOR_I saw this color on another woman, and I had to try it! ^_^ It's really a neon yellow than it is a &#34;flat yellow&#34;."
9343,0,"Dirty pool. Manufacturer not playing fair_I have used this for months and noticed no results whatsoever. Is there anything in that jar? Really, nothing. My face does not even tingle and there is 20% Vitamin C. I hear it is really great for your skin. Will have to try something else. You will see lots of good reviews but manufacturer promises another bottle for free if you put a review up on the site and let them know."
9212,1,Exciting!_This product was super exciting to me. I got it on a Christmas sell and I'm glad I did. The curls weren't as smooth and I hoped for but I'm pretty sure that was my own fault. It worked just as it claimed and was very easy to use. I did manage to get my hair &#34;stuck&#34; once but it was because of my own misuse and after a very light pull it cut off and I got my hair out with ease. I have long thick hair down to the top of my butt.
1351,1,"wonderful!_I've been using this wonderful moisturizer for 10 years.  So glad it is on Amazon.  I am 57, and it works great on me.  It contains SPF 15.  Great price.  I was so disappointed to see it gone from my drug store.  It isn't too greasy, and it hasn't made me dry ever.  Love it!"
6800,1,"Happy color_Beautiful color! Price is perfect, Sally sells the mini for the same price which I think it's crazy! Shipping is super fast (1-2 days)"
4059,1,"it's excellent!! I love it_everything in this package works great, all of the color are beautiful, the toe separators work really good it's a great product"
3608,1,"Smells great!_This is the first one that I have used that didn't give me that really bad burned skin smell after the tanning bed. One can actually go somewhere after tanning without being paranoid about how weird and burned one smells. It seems to do a decent job, could do better, but it works fairly well."
5994,1,Really cleaned out my pores_I was worried that my skin would be too sensitive for these brushes. I was wrong. You get a deep clean without any irritation. They made my Clarisonic even better!
9234,1,"Ellen Tracy Night Time Moisturizer_This cream works very well.  I put it on and my skin felt smoother.  As it dried it tightened up my skin and left a smooth layer on my face and neck.  Unfortunately, I have an allergy to scents and use only fragrance free soaps, lotions, shampoos and such.  Although the moisturizer's perfume is very light, I started to sneeze shortly after I used it.If you don't have this allergy, you will be very pleased with it.I recommend it highly."
5560,1,"Baby gets eczema from other creams_This one cures it, and it is very moisturizing. We love episencial products. I recommend this to people who have babies w sensitive skin it works well."
7255,1,"A Good Hair Dryer but not a Miracle Worker_I use this dryer on a regular basis and find it to be as indicated -- a good, reliable dryer. It is lightweight and has a diffuser which I use every time I dry my hair which keeps it from going in 1,000 different directions as the heat hits it. It seems to dry my hair in less time than my older dryer but I am not sure if I am actually receiving any benefit from the Keratin infused ring. If you purchase this dryer and receive a coupon that gives you a free diffuser you need to know that you may have to contact Remington in order to receive that product. For most of us, the code given on the coupon did not work when we went on-line to redeem it. However, in my case an e-mail to Remington customer service yielded great results --I received an apology, a diffuser, and free shipping. This to me was an example of excellent customer service --- thanks, Remington!"
5907,1,"love affair!!!!!!!!_This shea butter does wonders for your skin and hair. My only problem with this shea butter however is from the description it doesnt tell that the shea butter comes in a plastic bag. I mixed this with some olive oil, avocado oil, and almond oil. And presto you now have a hair moisturizer for dry natural hair and also you have a moisturizer that can also be used on your skin. The shea butter comes in chunks so if you want it to become of creamy consistency I would recommend microwaving it for 30 seconds and the adding whatever additonal products to the mixture. Also once the shea butter is kinda liquidity it will eventually solidify and become a creamy texture. I would definitely recommend this."
9079,1,"I often use a hair straightener and I've noticed that it works better when in conjunction with the serum_This has made a huge difference with my frizzy, unmanageable hair. I add a little when my hair is damp and usually add a little more when it's dry. It really keeps my hair from frizzing and keeps down the little fly-aways. I often use a hair straightener and I've noticed that it works better when in conjunction with the serum. I usually leave my hair down, but when I've styled it using this serum I've found that it holds better too for some reason.. I love that it provides heat protection so my hair isn't further damaged. It also smells great. The best part is, if I go 2 or 3 days without washing my hair, the serum doesn't make my hair greasy at all. Very happy!"
4996,1,"OPI_I think everyone knows this product, If you like it, you like it, if you are wondering, it keeps my polish from breaking apart for longer than any out there."
4885,1,"Great Strengthener_I bought this product because of my extremely short nails that are kinda too much of a joke to put nail polish on. I use this a lot and I find it to be great at making your nails stronger, I truly see no real difference in growth. The strengthening qualities are so good actually that when it starts to chip in the corner I can really see how brittle my nails are without it. Although I would love to give it 5 stars for that reason alone, I can't because of the fact that my nails are the same length. Its not like a oil either where it soaks in, more like a polish. You can't just keep layering it on. It does have a beautiful light peachish colour to it though. I would recommend that if you wear nail polish over it, you only put one coat of this on because it tends to chip with too many."
6810,1,"Great product!_I love this lip butter. It is incredibly pigmented but goes on smoothly. You don't have to worry about it smearing like a lipstick and it stays on for hours. I carry it in my pure as a quick way to pull my look together. i agree that the packaging sucks, but it doesn't take that much away from the products."
3144,1,Great nighttime lotion_I love this nighttime lotion. I have red hair so my skin is extra sensitive and this has helped even out my skin tone without irritation and my boyfriend even said my skin looked better. It makes your skin so soft and smells great. Believe the postive feedback this is why I tried it and I am so glad I did.
1413,1,"Good quality_It doesn't leave residue. Very neutral odor. It's virtually odorless on the skin. It has a built in dropper cap, allowing for sanitary application, and it's a true dropper cap. So many times, when using oil, I have squeezed out more than necessary. You only need a few drops and it eliminates  dragging. You can very easily glide over the skin. It leaves the skin feeling softer. I purchased to use as a carrier oil. For people without nut allergies, this is great. Still, I love Biotone cream for giving massages, but this is a welcome addition and very useful with essential oils."
4745,1,Not as big as I thought_The only thing about this item that I didn't like was the fact it was so small I mean you can do a full set of nails with the dish full and it's an amazing I product the size just got to me
140,1,"Quick, effective and gentle staple product for all skin types!_**Update from my last review: I absolutely love this stuff! Yes, the price has gone up a little, but most things have. I have no complaints about this product, and I have substituted with other products on impulse in order to save money and/or try something different. All that did was solidify that I love this product. Aveeno products are consistently known for being gentle yet effective products. Almost all of my skincare regimen is Aveeno and I couldn't be happier. It's best to purchase from Amazon, especially when you have Prime membership which just makes it even more awesome. I use this as a daily moisturizer and a foundation for makeup. It provides just enough cover up to even my skin tone without leaving residue, buildup, or causing my skin to feel weighed down. Regardless of the weather, it doesn't wear off either. It provides sunscreen, and overall continually moisturizes my skin during the harsh cold season and dry summer season also. This product won't ever let you down!**From my teens into my early thirties now, I still have combination/oily skin that is incredibly sensitive to the point where it becomes bothersome. I've been using this product for years, and for good reason!I needed a quick morning makeup routine that would even out my skin tone, provide sunscreen, Moisturize and of course simple to use. I've tried many, and this is the only product that works best for me. It blends in smoothly (I have very fair skin so that's the shade I choose). I use 1 pump and it's more than enough to cover my entire face evenly, not too much and not too little. A little pressed powder and lipstick, and I'm done!! Now, for the important reasons why I chose this brand over all the others.Makeup  tends to be too heavy, which causes my already oily prone skin to feel weighed down.  Others are too light, fading away into oblivion before I walk out the door in the morning.This product has multiple benefits:1) A little goes a long way, so the cost really isn't an issue for me.2) It contains sunscreen so my skin is protected.3) It's dermatologist recommended, so I can trust that it's safe for my sensitive skin because  it's free from harsh irritants (everything says 'dermatologist recommended', so I did research to confirm it).4) It's hypoallergenic. This ties in with reason #3, but this is a completely separate issue for me. Having sensitive skin requires a product that's hypoallergenic. If it's truly not, who knows what in it? I don't like taking those kinds of risks.Three years and going this product will always be part of my morning makeup routine."
1151,1,"Wow!  Clears fast...._If you have a stuffy nose and hate chemicals, this will probably clear it quickly.  But if you're the sensitive type it may not be for you.  Myself I like spicy peppery food and this spray is definitely &#34;spicy&#34;.  But I like the fact that it's food based."
8641,1,"Good 2% salicylic acid daily facewash for acne_One of the most annoying things about shopping on-line is that it's hard to know exactly what you're getting. This is really important with acne medications, since the different methods of combating acne don't always play well together. In case you're new to this, or didn't know about all the options that are available to you, I've tried to present them here. Caveat right up front: I'm not a medical doctor, just someone with too much experience with acne.This product contains 2% salicylic acid. For the science nerds amongst you, it's closely related to the active ingredient in aspirin and (at higher dosages) wart remover! Like many acne remedies, the science is a bit thin on the ground in terms of understanding what it actually does. Best guess is that it accelerates skin cell turnover, meaning your spots have less time to develop, and will emerge faster. It also acts as an exfoliant (literally helps remove the outer layers of dead skin), which may reduce the amount of debris that can block those all important secretory ducts in your skin.In appearance, this is a transparent blue thick liquid (gel), not entirely dissimilar to a watery toothpaste. It replaces a product that contained little plastic beads in it.  A little goes a long way (I find a half squeeze of the pump is enough to cover my face). You don't want to use too much... I currently suffer from very mild acne and had smoother skin, particularly around my lower jaw, in just a few days. It doesn't have much of an effect on spots that are already prominent, but has really helped with those underlying swellings that you just know are going to be spots by the weekend.Caveats: it may dry out your skin and this product does not play well with other classes of turnover accelerating chemicals, like Retin-A (applied either topically or orally). Retin-A or any of the similar Vitamin A-based treatments are powerful medicines, and should be treated with extreme care.Other options for acne fall into two additional classes:1) Molecular anti-bacterials - triclosan (like you'd find in tartar control toothpaste), topical clindamycin (Rx), even ethanol are used in a variety of 'anti-bacterial' or 'anti-biotic' soaps. First, these compounds are overused as it is, and are probably encouraging the proliferation of resistant bacteria (ever noticed how your anti-bacterial face wash is less effective after you've been using it for a year? Yes, resistance happens and it's that fast). Second, they're most effective for spots on the surface, but don't really deal with the underlying problem. However, you can combine these treatments with each other and with the skin turnover accelerators (above) or the other class of free-radical based treatments (below).2) Free-radical treatments - benzoyl peroxide (2.5, 5, or 10% topical creams) was one of the original anti-acne medications. This stuff is horrible for your skin long-term. Yes, it will clean up zits and spots pretty well, but it will age your skin like very few other chemicals, which you'll be less than thankful for by the time you're starting your first real job. Clearasil made their name with this chemical, but now publish a warning in small letters saying that you should discontinue use within 6 months. Personally, I wouldn't use it again, even if you paid me. The other problem with benzoyl peroxide is that it will non-specifically chemically alter anything they come in contact with (they're just very reactive), including other chemicals that are on your skin, bacterial cell walls, DNA, etc. The nerds amongst you will have realized that, assuming this stuff penetrates your actively growing skin cells AND get to the DNA inside them (a big assumption since the other skin cells are already dead) then it's a potential mutagen - awesome! It's also not a good idea to apply benzoyl peroxide and 2% salicylic acid treatments at the same time.I hope this was helpful, and I welcome comments from others who know more than I do. Bottom lines:There are good acne treatments available - if you've read this far, you're probably interested enough to see a dermatologist.  If you have mild to moderate acne, a gel like this one can help, and probably won't create too many other issues, beyond slight drying of the skin."
5082,1,Love this_I lie th way my face feels after using this mask !!! Its a must have it give your face a bright lift !!
8350,1,"Very cheap product_This product is very cheap. I hope it can have the same cleaning function as other brands with higher prices. I am still using proactive face wash, but this one is an alternative for my everyday face cleaning."
9777,1,Irish Spring in Your Shower_This body wash by Irish Spring is a great refresher in your shower.  The smooth glossy look as you squeeze out the body wash on your wash cloth or body net ball looks inviting.  Then it goes on smooth with a refreshing smell that makes your shower more refreshing.This is a larger size than other body wash containers I have used and has lasted a long time.  Very good product for the money and leave you feeling fresh and clean.  It states that it has Vitamin E  that conditions your skin while keeping you fresh and clean and that is worth the price.  Irish Spring Gear Body Wash is a 15 fluid ounces bottle that is plastic so no need to worry about dropping it.  Get a good refreshing shower using Irish Spring it worked for me.
6042,0,"Dark Circle Under-eye Serum - 1.0oz/30ml - Contains EyelissTM..._This serum aborb pretty fast after applying and you don't feel oily at all. I haven't tried it for a long time but I think it makes your skin smooth and feel well. The circle takes time to dissappear I think. Customer service is good, so don't worry. They have registered delivery.Update:I don't think the product works. It seems like water to me. I don't see any change."
8,1,"Magic Stick for Upper Lip Shadow_This product met my needs for Upper Lip shadow. I found it to be non oily, easy to smooth over skin and light on skin. You will need to use a press power for your skin tone after applying the concealer. Very please with the results."
7898,1,"A must have if you're a polish collector_I have a lot of nail polish.  I wouldn't call myself a hoarder.  I prefer collector, that sounds so much more elegant.  :-)These sticks are great for keeping track of your colours.  (Who knew I had so many blues and greens?!)  You can quickly and easily find a colour that appeals for your next manicure.Make sure you let them dry completely before putting the on a ring or screw or they will stick together.  I lay mine out on a cutting board with the edge hanging over so it doesn't touch the counter and I leave them for at least 4 hours or preferably overnight if possible.  I have never had a problem with wrinkling or bubbling.I prefer to put mine on split ring key chains rather than keep them on the screw.  It's easier to fan them out.  I use an ultra fine sharpie to label them with brand, name and how many coats I painted on the stick.  (See my picture)I highly, highly, highly(!!!) recommend these for anyone who wants to organise their polish.  If you put these on your 'save for later' list, you can keep track of it to get your best price.  I've gotten them for as low as $2.99 with free shipping.  Of course they do come from China so it takes a while to get them but your patience will be rewarded."
7614,1,Jessica_Best one! This did exactly what it was supposed to. The results were perfect! Highly recommended! My hair looks beautiful!
3808,1,They are hair bands_What do you say about hair bands. They are exactly what you would expect them to be. I gave them as a gift.
5103,1,"works like a charm_This is the only polish remover that works for me. I use the gel polishes and have such a horrible time soaking them off... I have tried other removers and this one is what works. Soaking time is cut in half, takes about 20 minutes or so of soaking and the polish comes right off. I've even soaked off acrylic nails with this polish remover. This remover is not hard on my skin or nails and does not burn unless I have a cut on my finger.A little big goes a long way for me. I order the large bottles and save up for when I need it, because I use so much of this stuff. Gel polish lasts on me about 5 days before chipping & I have to remove it to start over again. Great product, shipping is fast, and absolute great value."
6894,1,Well balanced moisturizer - Gentle with SPF_I've been using this as my regular face moisturizer. Feels light on my oily skin and moisturizes well under all my makeup. The 30 SPF protects without feeling too pasty. Cetaphyl is gentle on sensitive skin. Love that it's fragrance free. Well priced because this bottle lasts a long time for me.
2025,1,GREAT GLUE_I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS IWTH MY NAILS LIFTING WHEN USING HTIS GLUE AND IT DRIES VERY QUICLY.  I REALY DO LIKE THEMA ND THEY WILL LAST ME A LIFETIME.
6752,1,Love It!_This pallet is perfect. It has all the colors a girl who's just getting into makeup needs! Just the right amounts of mattes and shimmers.
2365,1,"Beautiful, excellent match for my fair complexion, but requires a primer to make it stay put_This foundation (in Ivory 01) suits my fair-with-pink-undertones complexion better than even Lancme or Dior. It goes on smoth and blends easily. The buildable coverage can mask many imperfections. Applied with a good sponge, it can we worn for a simple light-to-medium evening-out effect, or built up for a real full-coverage perfection. (I recommend The Beauty Blender for almost all liquid foundation, though I'll add that if it's a thick consistency, fingers are best.)TruBlend gives my skin a beautiful satiny finish that's not oily but not a mask-like matte either. It does eventually oxidize ever so slightly, but it's only noticeable if you don't blend the makeup line well enough and look at it in bright sunlight. A finishing powder helps hide it..Speaking of finishing powder, this foundation does, however, require one, or a good primer, and a good layer of sun protection. If you can get two-in-one, even better (like Smashbox's award-winning primer with SPF 30). Or a daily  moisturiser with sun protection will do. However you get it, you need an SPF of 15 or more every day to prevent signs of aging and to prevent the too-common skin cancer, as well.But besides that, well, you see, TruBlend simply doesn't stay put, at least not on me. It wears away easily, sometimes seeming to slide off my face. In heat, it melts right off. It never seems to &#34;set&#34;. I can gently wipe my nose or scratch my cheek 30 minutes after applying and it slides around.So a quality primer will not only create a nice smooth canvas for even better coverage, it will also help it last longer. A finishing powder with help even more, as well as further blurring imperfections. Plus some finishing powders supply that necessary SPF, such as BareMinerals's Finishing Veil. If you require oil control, primers and powders can also provide that as well.What TruBelnd provides, it provides wonderfully, and that's a beautiful buildable coverage that most importantly matches your skin tone so it looks natural and showcases your true, lovely, lively complexion!"
2905,1,"great product_you can freeze it or just use it as is.  it is great for sleeping, as it keeps light out and makes your headaches feel better.  i use it every night."
3860,1,"WILL BE REORDERING THIS_Heiress is a very nice, sexy, succulent pink, with maybe just a touch of beige to tone it down. I watched a video on YouTube where someone demonstrated several different NYX nude pinks, and all of the lighter ones made the girl's lips look like a corpse's. I am pale/sallow and this gives me a healthy pink tone. I think this color would work on any pale skin, whether sallow or pink toned. It's just creamy enough not to make your lips look dry and flaky, but not so creamy that it bleeds past your lip line."
4826,1,"Spectacular Color, Amazing Wear!_I love this color! A beautiful red with amazing sparkle and shine.  I do my nails with an LED lamp and do them every 2 weeks.  I'm sitting at nearly 2.5 weeks with this color on my nails and no chips at all, just the regrowth area at the base of the nail, but honestly, I could let it go until this next weekend if I wanted.  I will never go back to regular polish again!"
3109,1,"Work great and are high quality_I've had my set of two Miss Ooops sponges about two years, and they are good as new.  They work perfectly for getting deodorant marks of your clothes, and work quickly and well.  Sure, you can rub your fabric against itself to try to remove those marks, but these sponges work so much better and are fast and easy to use, especially when you're running out the door in the morning -- and don't want to have embarrassing white streaks all over your outfit!"
6525,1,"Best brush kit for its price!_The brushes were softer than I expected because they were so cheap. All brushes are nice and I use most of them but my only complaint is the lack of a large round eyeshadow blending brush. Other than that, this is SO worth your money!"
5915,0,"Not enough air, heavier, and just not impressed:(_I didn't need a new hair dryer but saw this John Frieda dryer in the store and I had to purchase! I gave it a try and was not happy. In my opinion there was not enough air coming out, and it sounds funny. I will return tomorrow."
116,1,Its great_I did break out when I first used this but otherwise it's fantastic. It is the richest cream I've ever used. We'll see if it helps my wrinkes.
81,1,"Works best with medium-light flow and are so comfortable!_Okay,,, so tmi review! Seriously!This product works perfect for days 3-5! It's amazing! I wore it on the airplane, used it during intercourse, and no blood at all! But it really lacks in the first two days when I have a heavy cycle. Not surprised. I would suggest maybe wearing at least a panty liner or doing what you regularly do for your time of the month.Out of all of the options (tampons, pads, softcups) it's is soo comfortable. Let's be honest, pads feel like a weird diaper (and I always feel like I smell with pads) and tampons can be a pain to get in especially when you're cramping!I feel like you definitely have to be familiar with your body and comfortable with it to put it in. You have to stick it a little bit back in there. It's more complex then a pad or tampon. But it really is amazing! Clean up is probably the worse of all options. You have to pull the softcup back out and it acted as a bucket for the blood (meaning you're pulling a pool of blood out). It can be messy and awkward to dispose of in a plublic restroom. Lot's of TP needed!So idk... it ultimately depends on what you like to deal with during you're period. I wish females didn't have a period!I would recommend anyone to give it a one time try! :DPS never writing a review for a &#34;feminine product&#34; again. BYE! :D"
5860,1,Its okay_love the color but its very scratchy on the scalp. It doesn't seem special from any other brush but I only just got it today. It brushed through my hair nice tho. But need to be gentle with it so you don't scratch your scalp bad but would be great if your head is itchy :-)Update I used it again on my dry hair now and its super gentle not scratchy so maybe its a little scratchy on a wet scalp but I still don't think its special just a regular brush I like it as much as my 5 dollar brush but this one is a better color and not as beat up :p
6468,1,"A lovely way to end the day..._Gave this to my wife and she was excited to try it.  That night while getting ready for bed, she washed her face with the Simple Facial Wash for the first time. She told me it worked pretty well and did clean her face. She used about a 1/2-inch diameter dot in her hand and it foamed up quickly and covered nicely. It claims that it contains vitamins that are good for the skin but the list of ingredients sound more like a lab that natural ingredients. It has a sort of neutral smell, similar to another product she uses. No fragrance but it claimed that!Overall, it's a good face wash. She has used it for the past few days and still says it does the job. She liked it as a change of pace (yes, she is one of those kinda gals).So, to finish up, she liked it!  And, she will probably buy it again to alternate with the other two facial cleansers. She said it really depends on the time of year what she will use. I can understand that."
3392,1,"Smells great and it works_I've been trying to find a simple, natural deodorant that does not contain aluminum chlorhydrate.  I tried Tom's of Maine and it had the amazing ability to make me smell about 5 minutes after applying--ew.  Browsing in CVS one day, I saw that this was on sale and decided to give it a try.  I was skeptical at first.  But it really does work.  Note that this is a deodorant, not an antiperspirant, so it can't be expected to make you sweat less (not that commercial antiperspirants ever managed to do that for me anyway).  It lasts all day for me and with the 90-100 degree weather we've been having lately, that's no small feat.It smells really good while applying; the pomegranate scent is very fresh and pleasant.  The scent is extremely mild, however, and after a few hours I don't notice it at all.  Although the scent fades, the product continues to be effective long afterward.Overall I'm very happy with this product.  I plan on trying the lavender and white tea one when I've used up the rest of the pomegranate."
7093,1,"So far, so good.  I like it.  (Will leave continuous feedback as I use it more.)_Had my first peel today.  After reading several reviews I was very careful to follow the directions step by step (as far as peel day goes) but truthfully I was in the sun yesterday and I did use an exfoliant yesterday, but this had no effect on my peel today.Background on me:  33 yrs old, brown skin (blk, white, chinese, indian mix), many many brown scars on my face.  I still get pimples.  I've had adult acne since I was 18. I did a chemical peel and microdermabrasion 10-12 years ago and 2 yrs ago I had a chemical peel in a spa but I simply can't afford it.  I was shopping in a beauty supply place when a lady approached me with a do-it-yourself at home peel and did one on me then and there.  I didn't know that you can do that so I looked up reviews and bit by bit I was led to discover this peel on Amazon.  My skin is getting older and doesn't shed as fast.  Sometimes it looks scaly, and it definitely is blotchy, nothing smooth about it's tone.  I live in California so I get sun all year round.  I don't regular use SPF but need to start doing so.So this morning I was excited to use the peel.  I did a patch test for 30 seconds.  Felt nothing.  Proceeded with regular peel.  Loved it.  It tingled but was not intense, was not incredibly hot, just tingly all over and a bit warm.  I did wear gloves, I fanned my face when it tingled.  I left it on for 2 minutes; probably could have done more but this was my first time.  I rinsed with cool water and then PATTED (NOT scrubbed) baking soda on my face.  Rinsed that with cool water.  Then I patted my face dry and used a natural gentle oil free lotion from a natural grocer's.  (I'm an organic girl mostly.)This first time I do have to say that my face is soooooo smooth and bright and youthful looking and soft to the touch.  I plan on doing this every week until the bottle is gone!!  Well, we'll see how it goes.  But I'm in love with this.  Just how my skin feels to the touch alone is awesome.  I can't wait to post more results."
7759,1,"Curls_These definitely produce curly hair.  They are a pain to sleep in.  It's nice to have the option of blow drying them.  It takes practice to use.  The extra long and wide ones weren't quite long enough for my hair, but I have really long hair, so I sometimes have to curl my ends with a curling iron."
5644,1,Best eyeliner brush_I love this brush i used it and it works very well on my eyes i am very happy that i got this one.
9897,1,"You'll find this in my shower from this day forward - thank you Adovia!_I wasn't sure how I felt about using a mud shampoo. I sort of thought it might feel gritty or smell funny but Adovia Mineral Skin Care Dead Sea Mud Shampoo proved me wrong on both accounts. I have terribly dry hair and since our youngest was born (8 months ago), my hair has been falling out in clumps and has felt very unhealthy. After the first wash with Adovia Mineral Skin Care Dead Sea Mud Shampoo I could already feel a difference. By the end of the first week, I was in love. I just received the conditioner and can't wait to see how the two products work together. If the shampoo is any indication, you will certainly find this combination in my shower from this day forward! Thank you Adovia Mineral Skin Care for creating this fabulous product and making my hair feel beautiful again!"
7266,1,using it for a year already_I have kept buying this eye cream for a year now after I tried it first time. it is a very good deal.
3096,1,"Lightweight, won't clog pores._I've always been a fan of Neutrogena products and this is no different. It's lightweight and won't clog pores -- excellent for sensitive skin. I rarely need foundation, but when I do, this is my go-to."
481,1,"Leaves my little dog with a very nice scent_Suds up and washes off easily, and get a good amount of shampoo for the price.  Would probably buy again."
2805,0,"Disappointing_It's a pretty lightweight lotion with a very strong scent. The scent is perfumey strong, and not all that pleasant. I haven't noticed any 'firming' of my skin at all, and made sure to use it daily anywhere that I felt is a 'problem' area. Also, this lotion is way too lightweight for me, the moisturizing doesn't seem to be enough, even initially upon application, let alone after an hour or two. This product does not seem to be up to normal Nivea standards, very disappointing."
5080,1,"A necessity for Gelish_You need this product in order to get all of your gelish polish off of your nails. Smell great, nourishes your nails and removes all of your polish."
4714,1,Best Hair Dryer_This is the best darn hair dryer. My daugthter asked for her own dryer so I didn't want spend a lot of money on her first dryer. This works way better than mine and I spent 3 times more on mine. It dry's faster and isn't as loud as mine. It's smaller and lighter. I think I might just have to get me one of these also.
1902,1,keep coming back to this!_I try others to save a few bucks but they never compare! This is great to set your makeup and to hydrate!
4804,1,very interesting_This can get hot- so use the glove it comes with;)i found it works weel but when doing other people's hair- on my own it was very hard to get a grip.
6850,0,"Junk_What a piece of junk. It took forever to be shipped because it was coming from hong kong.  When they arrived they smelled bad, and were wrapped in plastic.  I tried the large one for my hair and it ripped it out.  I ended up throwing all four of them out.  They are a piece of junk and you get what you pay for."
1389,1,"great case_when I bought it I thought, 'what if it's not as big as i think it will be!!' but then.. it came and it was bigger than i thought! it holds all of my mascara, and eye shadow sponge brushes, and blush brushes, and all of my other makeup accessories it was such a great find!!!"
5555,1,"I am surprised by helpful this product is_My cuticles get dry in the winter, and (embarrassingly) I tend to pick at them when that happens. I gave into impulse and purchased this product, not really expecting it to be any more effective than intensive hand moisturizer. Surprisingly, the serum really does seem to help. It is a pricey solution, but well worth the cost if one is seeking quick results."
6437,0,soap_Very hard on the skin...gave a bumps all over my face after 1 time use....very drying tooand i have oily skin...
755,1,I will order this lotion again_I'm very happy with Nature's Gate Organics C for Yourself lotion. It is very light and fast absorbing. It smells like oranges and not greasy. It does good job moisturizing.
8967,1,"Great texture_This sunscreen is great!  It's moisturizing and is not too thick, not too thin.  I also like that it's SPF 30 and not lower.  It is a little expensive though."
2949,1,Worth the money_I love that you can get 13 good brushes and a pouch for only 12.99. They work really good with wet or dry eyeshadows and I don't have any fall out. I would recommend these brushes to anyone who doesn't want to spend a lot but still wants great brushes.
2746,1,Perfect for brows_I purchased the clear mascara to use for my brows and it works great.  It can be used with our without a brow pencil to keep brows in place and will last all day.  Can't beat the price.
3169,1,"The Best_This is my ultimate favorite mascara, hands down, no complaints.  Works extremely well, no clumps and the applicator brush is great."
1245,1,"Subtle exfoliation, nice moisturization_The exfoliation is not as vigorous as with some other products, but my skin is smooth and very soft and I like the scent."
925,1,"Pretty nice_My first tea tree oil, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's nice. The smell is very herbal, but not unpleasant. I use this for my face, and find that while it can't eliminate my blemishes, it can calm them down. It also helps the broken skin to heal. Sometimes I mix it in with my facial cleanser, and used this way, it gives my face a very refreshing cooling sensation. I like the opening of this, which releases droplets slowly. It gives you a lot of control."
9153,1,"So relaxing_These bath salts are wonderful even when they are not part of a pre sleep ritual. They dissolve quickly and have a very pleasant not overpowering scent. I find them rejuvenating after a day of hard exertion but relaxing at the same time. Whether soaking for a long or short time, the effects are definitely rewarding."
1140,1,"Great protection_I use this before I flat iron my hair and my daughter uses it before she blow drys, either way you choose to use it, it Provides great protection. It also smells pretty good as well."
4476,1,if you want shine...buy it_my hair is over processed and natural curly.  this product makes my hair looks like new hair.  the shine pops the color and looks very healthy.  I am on my second container and will not be without again
3792,1,"Have noticed a difference but nothing major_i'm 21 and my lashes are medium length. i started using this serum so i can rely less on mascara for thickening/lengthening my lashes since mascara isn't healthy for your lashes. i have been using it for 2 months now and yes, my lashes do look longer :) but no change in thickness at all. i'm going to continue using it but haven't decided if i'll buy it again once i run out"
553,1,"great value_got 2 for a quarter of the price, excellent service, excellent quality. Would recommend to any one wanting to try this product."
704,1,"love this stuff_this is by far the best bleach I've found for my hair & when you've got a lot of hair, its nice having the extra powder instead of guessing with the packets."
4576,1,"amazing_LOVE this stuff. will repurchase again and again. i use this with Bio Oil and a 2.5MM dermaroller for my scars. it seriously makes everything look smoother and helps lessen my scars (NOTHING helps but this and Bio Oil, for real)."
6991,1,"Doll like look._I love this! It gives me full volume lashes. Since I'm asian I kinda look like a doll wearing these. Although I did have to trim a little off, because my eyes can't use the whole falsies. All in all, these are a nice try for the price. Will buy again."
3565,1,"Amazing stuff!_I purchased this cleanser on a recommendation from my esthetician. I recently developed acne and I'm in my early 30's. Adult acne is something new to me and it is extremely frustrating to deal with at any age! I was told this is a great deep yet gentle cleanser that wouldn't upset my skin or break me out even further.I have to say I was so delighted with the results! The cream feels slightly minty but doesn't have an overpowering smell. If you're anything like me, strong scents from facial products totally makes my skin react. Every time I use this I feel like I just had my face exfoliated with the actual exfoliating, it's that good! I use this twice a day and it doesn't dry out my skin. I have spent up to $45 on department store cleansers that yielded no results. For under $10 you can get awesome results and a new favorite cleanser. Do yourself a favor and purchase this!"
3000,1,"Easy to use, looks great_I love this stuff.  My eyes are really sensitive - I have had reactions numerous times to different eye shadows--from the super cheap stuff at the grocery store to department store brands that blow my budget.  This one has yet to bother me.  The pigment in this shadow is good--not as good as Smashbox or LARS, but it's far better than any of the other brands I find in the makeup aisle at Walmart or Target.  The instructions are helpful too--they walk you right through the first application.  As would be expected, the little sponge brushes that are included are totally useless, but I use shadow brushes anyway.  I really like the colors!"
5823,1,Very pleased with these brushes_These are perfect to use for applying facial mineral bronzers.  Since they come in two's I use one for pink tinged bronzer & the other one for my peach tinged bronzer (depending on which shades clothing I'm wearing that day).  They're both very soft & work nicely as applicators...
2722,1,"Smelling Like Chocolate_This came right on time as I just had a bad experience with a Suave body wash. It totally dried my skin out, andleft me scaly like a alligator or croc, which ever is worse. It may have also been the very hot showers, I know I m not supposed to take them, but they feel so good! Anyway, I've been using the vaseline for a few days and I am seeing some results. I don't know about the stretch mark thing just yet, but I will come back to do an update if things change. It's silky smooth, doesn't make me feel or look greasy and the smell I love. I usually can't smell it on me after  while, but other people do (if I don't spray perfume)To be honest I haven't used Vaseline lotion since my grandma was alive and well. (years ago) She would only use Vaseline, or that's all I remember seeing! Guess it was good even back then!"
2481,1,"Tiffany Blue_If you want nail polish the color of a Tiffany's box, this is your go-to color.  It matches perfectly and looks great on the nails."
5037,0,No different than a washcloth_What's the big deal with these facial cleaners?  My washcloth does the same thing for a lot less money.  Not worth it in my opinion.
6143,1,"Great Soap_I tried this soap out because one of my friends raved about it. I never get razor burn when I use this soap; I used to get it all the time. It works wonderfully for getting rid of body acne, as well. I have very sensitive skin, and this is a rare product that doesn't result in hives. I still need to use moisturizer after using this soap in the winter, however.I also like the smell. It's light and clean, but still nice. I convinced my mother and father to switch to this soap as well, but my mother thinks the smell is bad and does not like the grey foam it can make. That doesn't bother me, however, since it doesn't leave a dark residue. I do not buy this soap on amazon, however, since the price is double what it is at local stores."
2773,1,"love it_Love this face cleanser, especially in the morning. It smells fresh and awakens my skin. Feels good going on. Great value too."
959,1,Amazing._These clippers feel good in my hand and they actually cut my nails better than anything I have used before.
9480,1,"Good serum for your face...And it contains vitimans !!!_This is a moisturizer that makes my face feel very refreshed. I really like the fact that it contains vitamins C and E which are both very good for the skin. I use it before I put my makeup on.  It makes my face have a very smooth, silky feeling.  It only takes a few drops to cover my face and neck.  I really like this product."
3732,0,Sigh_I was SO hopeful about this purchase...unfortunately my super finicky skin broke out in little white bumps after using this. I'm probably just allergic to one of the ingredients. I'm happy other people have had better luck! But my hunt continues...
8699,1,"Great convenience for daily use_I really enjoyed this product. It's just like the name implies - simple to use, simple ingredients, easy on the skin. I have both a Clarisonic as well as an Olay brush and love them both, however don't always have the time or energy to use them. This is such a great solution. I have very sensitive skin, and this has not caused any irritation. I can definitely see the dirt it removes from my face, so I'm so grateful to have this product when I need a quick cleansing regimen."
6278,1,"Wonderful, soothing, moisurizing bar soap_The search goes on and on for products that will do the least damage to my dry skin, especially in the dry, heated New England winter. For some time I used the Clinique extra-dry formulation that costs well over ten bucks per large bar.But then I discovered this unscented Dove. Around here I pay about one-fifty per bar, in packs of four. So I can see that this offer from Amazon makes sense next time I need to replenish. And there WILL be a next time, as I do go through these. Being soft, they disappear more quickly. But that is a small price to pay for a soap that is formulated to not strip all oils out of my poor skin, while leaving me clean. I use it for both shower soap and hand-washing soap and find it totally satisfactory. Thanks, Dove, for omitting the stench (perfume) from this product. Nuthin' wrong with good old clean smelling persons!"
6550,1,"FAVORITE NEW BRUSH_I was very pleased with my order. Within a week of ordering I received it, the shipping was extremely fast. The brush was nicely packaged and none of the bristles were damaged. I always apply concealer under my eyes with my finger and I love that this brush mimics exactly that. It leaves a flawless finish and packs product in wrinkles nicely. I also use it for blemishes or any slight skin imperfections and it works wonderfully on that as well. This is my new favorite brush!"
173,1,Awsome prodcut_I use this product for several years as moisturizer for my body's skin. great absorption and effectiveness in keeping the skin moisturized till the next use.
8565,1,"Bought this before_It worked so well.  I bought more.  It is especially good after exfoliating skin.  It may sting a little, but it heals the skin well.  Would highlyrecommend this product."
3947,1,"Now I Have a CHOICE 2 WAYS!_I have used Dove Men + Care 'Green' (Extra Fresh) for some time now, and I really like it....a LOT.That being said, as an offer from the Vine Program, this sample of Dove Men + Care 'Red' (Deep Clean) was a 'natural' for me to want to order and try out.It, too, is very pleasurably scented, certainly one that would please most men, and that is important. The Extra Fresh (Green) is a more 'woodsy' scent, which I have usually preferred in a scent that I would wear. However, this one, Deep Clean (Red) is of a more spicy scent, and I find this type of smell also comfortable for myself.So, on the 'smell' factor, the count is 1 to 1...both are 'winners' in being a scent that most men would find pleasurable. I prefer shampoos that contain no scent, but with soap, I like the faint scent of a good soap when it lingers with you for a while. I see it as a reinforcement that I am clean and fresh enough to be out and about and thus never worry about my status of clean.This Deep Clean version also has those little 'scrubbing grains' that are fairly common in soaps, and in truth, they do feel good as you wash with this particular soap. Also, it rinses off well and I really like that 'clean' feel while toweling off.  The Extra Fresh (Green) also has a good rinse factor to it as well, which I have liked for some time.So, on the 'rinse-ability' issue, both are tied, again, which really does not surprise me, considering they are made by the same company.The verdict here, really is divided between the two soaps equally. Both have their individual place in how you wish to feel on any given day or evening. The (Red) being reviewed here, contains the advantage of the little scrubby particles and a classic spicy scent, rinses clean, and leaves your skin invigorated when you are through showering. The (Green) has the woodsy scent that is particularly nice, and it also rinses clean, and leaves your skin feeling more soft.The winner, then, is BOTH! Depending on what my schedule may be on any given day, I have a choice between the two. And, I also have the same choice in how I may choose to feel and smell when it comes to my evening schedule too! Sort of like getting 'the best of both worlds' so to speak! If you're like me, I bet you will end up keeping both on hand in your bathroom and enjoying the choice of both scents and feels!Both are recommended!~operabruin"
2559,0,"noooo_it doesn't blend in your skin and it feels really oily, i started using missha snail cream and i wanted to try it because it has more content and is less the cost, but it's not worth it. It has parabens or whatever and it smells weird, and it makes me break out, doesn't really do much else. I'm going to stick with Missha because it's got a addicting scent and works better than this."
8430,1,"I like it._Love it. The shadow smoothes on easily and the pigment is great in the lighter colors. I don't wear much dark eyeshadow so I'm not too concerned with the pigmentation in those. But if you're looking to use the dark shadows, this probably isn't for you. Only problem I have is the case cracked easily. Just have to be careful with it now."
5062,1,"Fast results, natural product_I've bought this at my local pharmacy before, and had been without it for a while. So when I got the package, well, I'd forgotten how small the bottle was, but as soon as I put it on the skin around my eyes, I remembered why I'd ever put out the money on it. This stuff WORKS!!!!!No lie, I saw the difference immediately. Now, I'm in my late twenties and have worked hard to take care of my skin, so maybe some folks have more issues than sleep-deprivation where their eyes are concerned, but I can say, without a doubt, that this product is effective, and, if it doesn't work immediately for you, give it time, because it's totally worth it. It makes it look like I slept a full night even when I'm dragging my butt to the nearest caffeine dispenser. Very impressed, and I'm never giving this stuff up!"
8311,0,"Do you love your hair? THEN DON'T USE THIS CRAP!_I have beautiful hair. Seriously- i get compliments on it all the time. It's frizz free, very easy to manage, no split ends.Or at least I used to be able to say those things about my hair.2 applications of this crap have DESTROYED it- it feels like straw now.I can't imagine what it would do to someone's hair if it was already damaged.UPDATE: I switched to infusium and aussie 3 minute miracle (both comparable in price and exponentially more effective in repairing damaged hair, in my case)and my hair went back to normal after a few washes."
9020,1,nice bun accessory_This is a great all metal comb that is a lovely accent for a bun or to sweep on side back. It holds heavy thick hair.
4691,1,"does the job._This spray bottle is FANTASTIC. I have used many others but the spray is powerful yet controlled and also has a wide range on pressure settings from fine, penetrating mist to strong, focused spray. It's a keeper. I bought 2! :)"
2531,1,feel great_I have long hair and the cap flatten it really well. it's soft on the skin and great price for two
2143,1,"My favorite purple eyeshadow_I have to be careful when choosing eyeshadow, because I am very pale and blonde, so colors really show up on me (which can easily make me look like a clown). This one is perfect for me. Although the darker shade is supposed to go in the crease of the eyelid, I like to blend the two colors on my lid for more color, but keep heavy on the light color so that it's not overpowering. The color stays pretty well too, even without a primer. I often have to touch it up every 4 hours or so, but that's not a  problem for me. Good product for the money!"
775,1,"No Better &#34;Clean&#34; Perfume Out There_I am terrible about what fragrances I wear.  I can't stand sweet or musk or flowery stuff. I just wanted a clean scent and I finally found it! It is the perfect blend of clean and unit still femine. THe D&G Light Blue is clean with just a tiny, tiny touch of citrus if you are really smelling it.  I get tons of compliments when I wear it.  It is not heavy so you do need to use it generously.  My only complaint is you need a mid day touch up and the scent does fade by then, but other than that this is the clean, great smelling fragrance you are looking for!"
1334,1,"please read this. you will be surprised as to why i gave it 4 stars_hi everyone that might read this...let me first start off by saying that the ingredients/quality of this cleanser (more like co-cleanser) are very good and anyone that is looking for something more 'natural' should give this a try..but let me also make some other things clear:..if you have rather damaged/dry hair then this may not be for you...you see, because it is so light (the ingredients are natural and not 'heavy' on your hair) this isn't going to aid much in helping to rebuild or strengthen hair..but if you have hair that is considerably 'normal/healthy' then you will probably find this an enjoyable cleanser...now real quick let me tell you my experience...as a background, I have curly hair (Caucasian) that is very dry/frizzy and very very fine...I am always on the hunt for something that would be nice to my curly hair...now my hair isn't very curly, like its not corkscrew curls, just wavy with a few ringlets...now to the first impression: when I first used the cleanser, I rubbed it into my hair and scalp (like the instructions say)..the product made my hair itself very soft (like you would imagine since it has a creamy texture)...but for my scalp...wow...it might just be me, but there is something in this that made my hair fall out like nuts!! it just kept coming out loll...only in the shower though...now don't be scared off, I'm pretty sure it was something like peppermint or another 'invigorating oil' that irritated my scalp (I have kind of a sensitive scalp)...I cant be sure though exactly what it was...I used the matching conditioner afterward, and my hair wasn't moisturized enough..(that has to do with the no silicones thing)...I tried it again a month or 2 later and it had the same effect...so youre probably wondering why I gave it 4 stars if I had a bad experience loll...well, im rating the product, not my experience...so in closing, this is a great product for someone with hair on the healthier side and if you try it, don't worry about the hair-fall thing, since it might just happen to people with more sensitive scalps like myself...hope this helps, and have a nice day :)"
5719,1,Eyebrows look good_This has grown my lashes but really made a difference in my brows. They are full and look great
5682,1,Very good quality n very utilize_I love this case to keep my sigma brush set. I leave it in my car n make up between the red light traffic. Thx so much.
8862,1,"Less expensive, lighter, less attachments then professional model_I've been cutting my own hair for over ten years. At $40 to $50 including tip, three or four times a year my professional model hair clipper has more than paid for itself. And compared to a lot of haircuts I don't do that bad of a job (if I do say so...). The one problem I had was the cord and ten different attachments. The Remington takes care of those two problems.The Remington is light, cordless and only requires three attachments. The clipper adjusts so that each attachment has a wide range of lengths. I'm used to what is called the Barbershop length system which equates to something like this: a number 2 = one quarter inch, 4 = half, 8 = one inch, 12 = inch and a half. The Remington can be used that way or in meters and ranges from 0 to 13 in Barbershop mode.The way I've always done it is I start with the longest on top, then a 4 on the edges, then 8 to start blending. Then I use all the lengths in-between until it's decent enough for me. Occasionally, after a few showers I may have to do a little trimming.The Remington works quite well. Of course, first step was to charge it overnight. The included instructions are horrible, not even correct English. It took me a minute to realize that full charge was in minutes.  The pouch that comes with it is useless; not everything fits, it's awkward and cheap.While I love the fact that all you need to do is push a button to raise and lower the head the buttons are easy to touch and accidently adjust. You will want to double check (measure twice) before you switch to cutting mode. Which is also weird, it's a sliding lever on the side called lock mode: confusing. The digital readout is nice and easy to see. It turns off on its own after 10 seconds - not sure why the delay.The unit is light but also not as well built as my professional model. If you pop off the head you can how it is made and may wonder how long this will last. Overall it looks ok, like a man's clippers.But it's not nearly as expensive as my professional model, it's lighter, has less attachments to fiddle with and is cordless making it a lot easier to use. I'll eventually get used to the buttons and using it (probably after a mistake or two) and if it lasts it will make it a lot easier for me to get the job done!"
3597,1,"great_didnt fry my hair. aDecent amount of bleach and devoloper, made my hair almost white,doesnt smell bad, doesnt turn hair yellow (my hair was green before i put it in so i dont know if your hair will turn yellow if you have darker hair) hair dye stuck well ( i used punky color)"
6227,0,"Not a fan_Like all Shellac products, this one is shiny and lasts forever.  However, I'm not a fan of the color.  It's more sparkly than I like, and the pink tone is a bit on the orange-y side.  Neglige is much better.  Sadly, I can't see ever actually wearing this color."
7394,1,GREAT!_This color works far better than the batiste for dark brown hair. It doesn't leave the color residue all through your hair and still leaves your hair cleaner looking and more wearable! I recommend this for sure!!
1916,1,"Slick_This product didnt really 'plump' my lips in any way. In fact, the first time I used it my lips just burned for a while. I know plumping stuff is just an allergic reaction to make your lips plump up but I just got the reaction with no plump. I do have to say though, that did stop after about two tries and in general this is just a fantastic gloss. I keep using it b/c the smell is AMAZING. I love spicey-like smells and thats not a typical smell in lip stuff and thats what this product has. I LOVE the smell and the gloss is great quality. So for me, the product didn't work for what I wanted it to but it's still a great product for general use."

8849,1,"These plates are good for average sized nails_The images are attractive and I have no problem picking up the images. My only complaint is that they are too small for my thumbs, but fit all my other fingers fairly well. I would say if you have small to average sized fingers go for it, if you have very large nail beds these images might be too small.The backing is a thick cardboard so no sharp edges and I keep them in an album with full sheet page protectors.Overall a good purchase."
7509,1,"Pricey, great build quality._A pricey comb but the build quality is really sturdy, hold up well with thick men's hair and fine enough to use with product well."
2563,1,"Powerful Sexual Attractant_This blend is great.  It does EXACTLY what it claims to do.  I have used pheromone products from many different companies, and so many are garbage. This is definitely NOT. IT WORKS. It does have a distinct aroma, so you will need to have a good cover scent.As for the person who said the reviews are fake....I can tell you they are ABSOLUTELY NOT. I will say that I have not bought the product here, through Amazon, but through Love Potion's direct website. I have been buying from them since 2006, and have never been dissatisfied. I just thought that the products from the company need some honest feedback from people who have used the product for years, are happy with the products, and are also happy with the level of customer service they have received.And, you can also see.....these are not the only products I have reviewed, either."
7936,1,"I really like it._I bought this flat iron one month ago and it does a pretty good job on my natural/non-relaxed African American mid-back length 4a hair type. I used this with my TRESemme heat tamer spray, Garnier Fructis anti frizz serum and Aphogee protein leave-in conditioner. I didn't have to use an insanely high temperature to straighten my hair. I had it set at 360 degrees. I sprayed my leave-in conditioner, heat tamer and added a little serum to my hair on my towel dried hair then I blow dryed it. I sprayed on a little more hreat tamer and started straightening by using the chasing method. It took me about an hour to finished. It's a great value for the price. You can pick the heat settings, it has a swivel cord and there is a lock switch. You can also lock the buttons so you wont accidently push the buttons. It didn't give any heat damage and it managed to straighten my hair very nicely. Before this I bought an Instyler and a cheap Gold n hot flat iron I bought at a beauty supply store. This straightener worked a lot better.I was originally planning to get a CHI or a Sedu but I didn't want to spend quite that much on something that might break after only one year. I've never used either one of those straighteners but I think the frizz therapy is on same level in terms of results. I gave this product the first 4 stars because of how good it straightened my hair and the fifth star for all the extra features it has."

7352,1,"perfect_this tool is really good because i have long nails that make putting on lashes a pain. now with this tool, its so quick and easy."
2595,1,"love this_i really really love this perfum, its so strong that everyone knows when you enter to a room, it is so good."
2788,1,"A goto product_Leaves my hair soft and feeling wonderful! This is a great deal! I have left this product and always come back to it. Works better than any serum I've tried and it doesn't leave my hair icky. However, you need just a little bit."
3395,1,Great moisture!_The Sheer Infusion body lotion by Vaseline is an excellent product. It is readily and quickly absorbed into your skin without greasiness. It's great after a shower.  It is also very good as it keeps your hands moisturized especially after hand washing.It has a light aroma.
5876,1,"Great eyelash glue_This stuff is great!  It applies black, so you cant see it and it sticks really well.  I'm very pleased with it."
5379,1,"8N Medium Natural Blonde looks gorgeous_I was having the hardest time finding a shade of blonde that worked for me after I bleached my dark blonde color to almost white. I tried a L'Oreal medium blonde but came out more like light golden blonde and was very unflattering. This one seems to be rather true to the color on the box, though perhaps just a bit lighter, but my hair is pretty damaged so that could have made it harder for the color to take, though I did use a protein filler with this.The color is beautiful, shiny, seems multi-dimensional, and it does look like salon quality, at least to me. It's very natural looking and in some lighting it looks like I've got highlights and lowlights in it as well. It wasn't very damaging to my hair at all, and the color actually smelled kind of flowery though there is a slight chemical smell. The conditioner it comes with smells amazing and was moisturizing, but most box hair color conditioners are!Application was very easy and not messy at all and it rinsed out just as easily. I have thick hair, and though it's only just barely at my shoulder blades when I use other hair color(Garnier, L'Oreal, Clairol) it usually takes two boxes to cover it all which is bothersome and expensive. With this, I still actually had some left over after all my hair was soaked in the foam. Unlike liquid and cream dyes it was also really easy to massage this stuff into my hair, really it reminded me of putting in shampoo.I love this stuff, and I think I'm going to keep using it for a long time, unless they discontinue it like most hair color lines end up doing with my favorite shades."
7534,1,"awsome case_i love the removable tray,  and the fact that you can take only parts of the case on the go. It is very spacious and i love the color. This case is a must have. :-) :-) :-)"
4606,1,Love these!_Purchased these for my three daughters (tweens/teenager) and they love using these to add sparkle to their nails for fun!
3719,1,"Smells Great!_I loved the smell of this detangler. The shea butter has a great scent. The bottle is large and it's easy to spray out the amount needed on my hair. My hair is straight and color treated. This product worked fine, but it was a little too much conditioner for my hair type. If I just sprayed a small amount, it was ok. If I sprayed a lot, then my hair seemed greasy. Probably better for thicker heads of hair."
2826,1,"CK Hits Mark with Intense Euphoria..._If you like a smooth fragrance with a splash of spice, Intense Euphoria should be added to your collection.  Intense offers a different scent than the signature Euphoria, but one that you will enjoy and find will last the day.  While probably considered best suited for Autumn or Winter, the softness works for any occasion and time of year.  The Amazon price is unmatched and with the Free Shipping option, Intense Euphoria is a must.  4.5 stars..."
9635,1,"Great for the price_I have used Jergens Natural Glow with amazing results.  For a sunless tanning lotion it provides a sun-kissed glow to my skin.  I saw Suave came out with a similar product and I thought I would give it a try.  The price is somewhat comparable.  The coverage is great and it does not leave my skin greasy or sticky.  Visible glow doesn't streak and you get flawless coverage.  Unfortunately, the scent is the same as the Jergens Natural Glow.  The smell isn't horrible in the bottle but when you apply it in the morning, by the end of the day there is a chemical type smell.  Sunless tanners have improved with time with the application but the scent still needs improvement."
4939,1,Love them_I loves these eyelashes. They don't look too fake and everyone compliments me on my eyelashes. I will definitely be buying more of these.
233,1,"AMAZING STUFF_Get this. Now. Seriously. I have bitten my nails since I was a kid and I have not bitten my nails for two weeks now (since I started using this). I actually have some fingernails to paint now. It tastes horrible, which is exactly what I wanted. It is not peppery- it is something else that's way more putrid. Similar to licking a cotton swab of fingernail polish remover. I have to reapply every two days or so because the bad taste fades after that amount of time. Be careful when you eat finger food, as the taste can get on your food. I am delighted with this product."
1986,1,Konad Lover_Their plates and designs are really awesome. Make sure when you are using the plates that you also purchase the Special Konad polish to use with the plates. You will get some really great results when you use their special polish. I have tried regular polish with the plates and I personally prefer the Konad special polish. Its all well worth the money!!
9953,1,"Great Eye Gel!_I love that they have made this container with this really large push down top that dispenses the eye gel easily and without any mess. I have RA and anything that can help me with inconvenient twisting and any unnecessary strain on my fingers, is something I really look out for.I also love that Youth Express Eye Gel is 100% Natural and 75% Organic. I have been leaning more and more towards natural products in the past year because my skin has become so sensitive to scents and ingredients. There are no alcohols, parabens or sulfates in the ingredients. And the best part is that this product is made right here in the United States!Of these ingredients the 3 that you will be most interested in are:&#8226; Plant Stem Cells: Prevents premature aging of the fragile skin surrounding the eyes.&#8226; Matrixyl 3000: Firms and tightens the skin around the eyes.&#8226; Hyaluronic Acid: Deeply moisturizes the skin to reduce skin problems that occur due to age.It's a nice firm gel that is almost clear and it feels really good going on. I like to keep my gels (a registered skin specialist gave me this advice years ago) in my fridge. They last longer, especially if they are natural or organic, but the main reason is that the coolness will cause the product to give you even better instant results.I also had read that models use this trick right before shoots to cause the pores to tighten making their face look flawless. They also will splash very icy water on their face. It may not last all day, but if you have something important that you want to look good for a few hours, this really does work!While this product won't help deep wrinkles, it will help with some fine lines. It's mostly for dark circles, puffiness and for sagging skin. It will help even out the skin color which in turn helps your face look more glowing, so anytime you can look better is a plus in my book."
8945,1,"Love this stuff!_So I first found out about this product when I went to SF last month, I was walking around the mall and a girl decided to pull me aside and do my hair in one of those little booths! I fell in love with the hair straightener so my BF decided to buy it for me! Anyway, the girl used this argan oil and gosh it made my hair feel soooo soft and shiny! she gave me sooo many samples! I wanted to buy the bottle but that was $35, I went online and I found the whole set for less than $20! I bought it and I am soo happy with it!"
9499,1,"Smells divine, but if your hair is easily weighed down, expect the 'wet' look_If your hair is particularly susceptible to products creating a greasy look, be aware that this is probably not the &#34;lightweight&#34; nourishing treatment you are looking for.  I'm still waiting for the lightweight oil treatment that supposedly does not leave hair looking greasy. The only people who look great with wet looking hair are models, and that is not my profession.  Still, it is a good product for repair purposes.The Dove treatment is useful for treating hair that is tired and has been abused by winter, hard water, irons, dryers, or other things.  In my case, it entails a bit of planning to use this product.  I usually apply it on a Friday evening so my hair doesn't look so greasy when I return to work a couple of days later.Macadamia is a fantastic scent.  The smell of an actual macadamia nut farm is beyond comparison to this product, but I don't know if you could ever replicate a nut farm's scent completely.This is a nice product, but plan ahead before use."
674,0,"Gagging Smell_A friend of mine recommended Shalimar perfume to me. She said it was so beautiful I had to try. So during my next trip to a perfume store, I asked for Shalimar. Sprayed it on paper, and then on my wrist. Both the paper and my wrist smelled so terrible to me, that I felt as if I was going to vomit. Couldn't wait to get home and wash it off my wrist. Very old-smelling, nasty, and pungent perfume. Like some kind of old rotten wood/pines. This is not to offend anyone. I understand that every perfume smells different on different people. I also understand that what one person likes, another may not like at all. We all have our own tastes in perfumes. Well, this is the case for me with this particular perfume. To me, it smells so ancient that it reminds me of old rotten/moldy woods! Yuck!"
5212,1,"Very good_Beautiful colors, the palette is big just the right size, I will definitely buy more, I hope it also stays longer"
7765,0,"The size of these were weird_i really wont buy these again the other brand is better Vakind Hair Curler Magic Spiral Ringlets, I guess there ok for short hair but you will need a million of them"
7321,1,"It Works for Me!_I have a mild dandruff problem. I have used a few other products with no success at all. I came across this one and gave it a try. It did work for me! I have to say that dandruff is very particular, and some products may work for you, and some others won't. If you have not found a product that works for you, I would strongly suggest you give this one a try.Other reviewers have indicated a problem with the shipping, the bottle dripping or something like that. I will say my shampoo came perfectly fine. Remember you are buying through amazon, which is 100% guaranteed, so if something is wrong, they will refund you or replace the product."
5735,1,"Very useful_Been looking for a smaller kabuki to apply face powder. I notice a lot of people complaining that this brush is too small, I find this to be the perfect size as it gets to the exact areas I need it to. I personally do not have oily skin, so I don't like to powder everywhere. I powder only area's that foundation breaks up more easily, and under my eyes to set concealer. The only reason I gave this a 4/5 and not 5/5 is because i think the handle can be a little longer, for whenever I have fake nails. The brush is super soft, and well made."
1993,0,highly disapointed_okay. so i watched the little video that accompanies this product and i was all excited because it looked so cool. well its not. i really dont think it did anything for me at all. i like the problematic mask much better
8778,1,"Good Bye Frizz!_Motions Straight Finish Sealer,  With keratin protein and nourishing almond oil. This Finish Sealer is recommended for all natural hair textures/types and helps to retain moisture and control frizz.The added Keratin boosts really makes a difference when wearing my hair down with relaxed curls or taking the time to straighten it with a flat iron after application to get a much smoother shinier finish. I apply this to my hair every day just to give it some extra softness and added shine and it makes my hair look beautiful not to mention it's much easier to comb through now and style.If you have coarse or dry or really curly hair then you should definitely give this a try. I would also recommend this for little girls whose hair is difficult to comb through as a de-tangler."
6411,1,"repeat customer_Unlike some of the more expensive brands I find gelish brand is my favorite. For the non builders (thinner viscosity).I use this to (encapulate 3d items and regular polish, cover rhinestones, and outstanding for doing snake skin nails with any other gel polish)Great product,"
1099,1,"Sweet and long lasting_I just got this perfume for Valentine's Day.  I love it!  Yes, it is sweet smelling, as another reviewer mentions, but it's a pleasant sweetness.  Cotton candy does describe it, actually.  But who says grownups don't like smelling yummy??  There's a hint of vanilla as well and overall, I think the combo is fantastic!I love Curious, and now I love Fantasy, too!  They are two very different perfumes, so it's easy to understand why a person can like one and not the other.  I will say, though, that Fantasy lasts far longer than Curious.  You can apply it in the morning and still smell it when you go to sleep!  Which, I don't mind at all...I recommend this, of course, but I recommend you sample it before you buy.  Just because you liked Curious doesn't mean you will like this one."
3367,1,"Cheap, smells great and works well!_I call this soap 'Dudu Awesome'! It's incredibly cheap, smell amazingly fresh, like fresh cut grass in spring, and works well without drying my skin. I use it in the shower, to wash my face (I have rosacea too) and also use it to wash my hair! I highly recommend it. It's looks nasty but don't let prevent you from trying it!"
113,1,"Great facial steamer for home._I've been using this steamer for the last 9 years.  My first lasted about 8 years, but got a little crusty by the end of it.  The timer option is great so  I don't have to keep track of time.  This one includes a convenient measuring cup.  I wasn't crazy about the exfoliation tool (prefer to use a combo of Cetaphil and baking soda), but I guess it does the job.  I use the steamer about 2x a week for blackheads."
4739,1,Amazingg_leaves hair soft and shiny! Especially good for thick and coarse hair! Favorite product by Pantene! A must buy. Continue to buy for sure!
4854,1,"Love the product but didn't care for the color_I've used Gelish before but it was applied at salons.I love the Gelish products for the quality, value and variety of colors. For Christmas, I bought myself a UV lamp and Gelish polishes so I can do my own nails at home and save some money. I was looking for a pink polish so I decided to try Passion. I would characterize the color as a kind of bright, medium pink with a touch of coral. I'm not too crazy about the color which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It went on smooth and lasted over 2 weeks without any chips."
3168,1,Great foundation_I really like this foundation. It is inexpensive and provides full coverage without feeling too heavy. It does tend to have a bit of a sticky finish so I always finish it with a dusting of translucent powder. It lasts all day and does not make my sensitive skin break out.
7418,1,"Marbleizing Pen set_Love this for many projects.  Not just for nails.  Good quality and  will lasta very long time.  Easy to hold, no slipping from your fingers."
3399,1,Excellent - healing power_Will all hand sanitizer that I have been using I needed a good lotion.  This has a great smell and healed my dry cracking hands.  My daughter loved it for her skin and found that held the moisture very well. My son who has Eczema said it made him more itching.. I worked great for 3-4 family members and has been a great tool in this flu season.
7738,1,"AWESOME_This stuff is AMAZING. I have fine, thin, medium-dark brown hair. If I wash my hair at night and sleep on it, it gets oily...that fast. This product gives me clean, volumized hair and it does not feel weird like some of the drugstore brands I tried.This stuff is wonderful and works just like it says. If you have really dark hair you may have a harder time making it not look like you put powder in your hair but for medium to light hair, this is awesome. The fragrance is not bad or overwhelming."
3667,1,"My first experience with lipstick_This was the first lipstick brand I used, and I do really like it. The texture is smooth and the color definitely pops, though this is more of a bright shade of red rather than a deep red. It doesn't last as long as I would like, but I've definitely tried worse."
7908,1,Love the pokets_The amount of pockets and nooks and crannies in this organizer are amazing.  However it doesn't really stay open on its own unless the center pack is crammed full and some of the pockets become hard to access/see when its folded in on itself.
7793,1,"Good stuff and doesn't hurt the wallet_Here is an inexpensive product that does what it says it will do:  Hydrate & condition; eliminate frizz and provide a soft flexible hold.  I used this hair cream after I shampooed and conditioned.  I applied to my hair once I absorbed some of the water.  My hair wan't drenched but more than damp.  This cream gave me shine, definition, and softness.  I tried it on dry hair, as the directions say it can be used.  My dry hair didn't like it.  The cream is very thick and the application is not smooth on dry hair and my hair did not absorb the product.  This 8 oz. bottle will last me for a long time.  I am happy with the ingredients and the scent.  I believe that this product would work well on all hair types, you just need a dab for fine tresses and a dollop if you've got thick, long hair like I do."
5176,1,I can even re-apply make up over the wax._Waxy without the shine.  This product helps keep my eyebrows nicely shaped and I can even re-apply make up over the wax.
3922,1,"Great Color!_This is such a beautiful color, and the name really describes it well. I definitely recommend this to all looking for a good, clear-based blue giltter nail polish. I think this would be amazing for Spring 2011 over Lemonade (Orly), or even Turquoise and Caicos (Essie)."
6456,1,"Great body wash alternative_Love the light, refreshing smell. It's very moisturizing, I hardly have to put on lotion when I get into the shower. A little goes a long way but it's very liquidy, so watch how you pour it in order to make it last longer. If you get body acne try this out. I bought this because I read about oil cleansing and how oil dissolves oil better than water. Makes sense if you think about it."
800,1,"Worth the price_I love this product. It turns my dull hair into vibrant hair. The only downfall is that you have to be careful with the amount you spray on. If you spray too much your hair turns out looking greasy. However, with the right about it does a wonderful job."
2720,1,"Cuckoo For Cocoa_I have lots of more expensive body lotions from specialty stores; they usually come in sets with matching scented body wash and spray. They are great, but sometimes you want something that won't be quite so fragrant. This works great as a moisturizer and has a really pleasant fragrance. It reminds me of suntan lotion, which is a scent I love. However, it isn't so strong that you will feel like you have just gotten back from the beach."
6452,1,Awesome!_Super hydrating and soothing. Perfect for my extremely dry skin. Also brightens and tightens like it says it does. Great stuff!
4968,1,"Clean and Clear_I used to use Yes to Blueberries version until Amazon decided to stop the two for one pack and secretly keep the price the same and send only one pack! This is the next best think. The cloth is thick and big enough. Almost enough that I could use half and give the other half to my husband. The smell is great. Does a good job. Does not replace washing your face though. Good for makeup remover, especially eye makeup. For the price a great bargain."
9288,1,"Wow, they do exfoliate!_First I must say these are more the size of a long hand towel. However they are perfect for scrubbing your back! they are long enough to grab in both hands and shimmy up and down your back. They really exfoliate well. My skin felt very clean after using this product. I use them for scratching those hard to reach spots on back too. You can use them for exfoliating almost anywhere, however they are rough and I wouldn't recommend them on sensitive skin. I received this product for a fair and honest review."
5202,1,A good mascara remover_I use this daily to remove my mascara and am happy with the product. Removes my mascara gently and it's convenient.
9719,1,"love this scent_True to all Caress products, your skin feels so soft.  With this body wash, a little goes a long way.  There is alot of lather so you really only need a quarter size drop in the shower.  It rinses off very clean and quickly and it has a rich lather that has a fantastic scent.  It actually wakes me up and puts me in a tropical frame of mind.  I will continue to use this.  Great soap !"
6305,1,Beautiful bob_I was very surprised and how nice this looked at such a low price. The cut is really good and the synthetic hair is soft. I had bought this for fun but find it is very wearable.
2532,1,"Functional_These were super cheap so I figured even if they didn't work it was worth a shot. I have very thick long hair and they did the job holding it all up in my wig for Halloween, so woo hoo!!"
7737,1,"Smells & Works Great, Got my Friend Addicted Too_I have light-colored, thin hair and my friend has dark brown, thick hair, and both of us use and love this product (the &#34;powdery&#34; look goes away when you brush it in).You can't use it all the time or it will dry out your scalp too much, but my friend joked that she was never going to wash her hair again because she loved it so much."
3675,1,Wow_I read the reviews and didn't believe it when people was saying that this mascara was very difficult to get off but they were telling the truth. I think that is the bomb. Applied the right way makes it look like you have false eyelashes on and the fact that you can go to sleep and wake up and still have long flowing eyelashes is great. I use an automatic facial scrubber which does not allow me to scrub my eyelashes area. I usually take my index fingers and softly massage a cleanser under and around my eyes to remove any mascara residue that has fell off leaving my eyelashes looking awesome. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that don't have a lot of lashes because it works great.
4314,1,"My wife LOVED it_I received this item though the Amazon Vine program.  Honestly, I do not know what it does, or why it works, but it does for some reason.  My wife is in love with this serum and has vowed to buy it again when hers runs out.  She uses it every morning, I assume that's the right thing to do, and she tells me over and over that she wouldn't go a day without it.So Ladies, if you're on the fence and this review is the one you're reading, she absolutely recommends it."
6762,1,"daughter in law and granddaughters say WOW_daughter in law uses these to do fancy nail decorating on the granddaughters fingers.  I am supergrandma!!!  a better title than some I have had.  hahahahahahhahhahah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  anyhow, these are very interesting additions to our nail equipment."
6458,1,"A good new skin care lotion_I tried this new cream after bath, it made my skin feel really soft, soaked in well, and didn't sit on my skin like most creams do.  I would use it again.  It has no perfume smell, which I don't like in a lotion."
6124,1,Inexpensive & Quality_Do not look like they cost as little as they did. Great variety of colors. A little difficult to rotate between colors but not a huge deal. Good buy.
653,1,"Great product! Suggest to use with sprayer!!_very good product, fast shipping and have used it before, color is good for blondes, very good as far as using it to cover spots"
6294,1,"Good Buy_I was really pleased with these brushes, and you cannot beat the price.I use them every day and so far I haven't had any of the usual problems with value brushes such as them coming apart or the bristles falling out when applying make-up and getting every where (which is the most irritating thing imaginable when you are in a hurry), and they apply everything nicely.The case is very handy as well.I am very glad I came across these!"
6922,0,Awful nail file!_The rough part wore off very fast (after 3 manicures) leaving a smooth patches on the file which is pointless. Save your money.
7628,1,"Handy drill, works well!_Thanks for creating such a product. This machine is strong enough to do the job and small and light enough to take anywhere. I love it. I took it out of the envelope and dropped it but nothing was broken and the bits work just fine."
5602,1,"Lovely tropical coconut scent that lingers_This moisturizer brings back memories of using Hawaiian Tropic suntan oil in the late 70's.  Heavily coconut scented, this may interfere with any perfume you would want to wear as the scent lasts about 3 hours (on ME)-but it may not on YOU as we all have a different body chemistry.  Since this has such a beachy scent, I limit my use of this to Spring and Summer.Even though it's called Argan Oil Moisturizer, argan oil is #8 on the list of ingredients; the acai berry extract is way down on the ingredient deck.  I have dry skin and this leaves me feeling moisturized all day.  Good ingredients for the most part: several oils such as sesame, jojoba, and tea tree (the coconut overrides the tea tree odor which is a good thing).  High levels of Vitamin E.  This also contains parabens which some people want to avoid.  Made in the USA and no animal testing which ranks high in my book."
3469,0,"Hate it:-)_Made no real difference ,but I usePRAI products,and I here ingredants are bad:-) look up info before by being because its a head game to return and no garentee unless you pay for regestered mail delivery:-)"
3476,1,"Nice shower luxury_There are many reasons I like this body wash.  First of all, the pump is a stroke of genius.  Being able to leave the bottle in place and squirt the product onto a washcloth or puff is so much handier than trying to juggle a slippery wet bottle.  It also makes it possible to measure the amount you use very easily, enabling you to get exactly the amount of lather you like without guessing.  I also found it lathered well; I used four squirts initially and quickly realized that two would have been plenty (note that I do have soft water).I usually don't like fruit fragrances (except in fruits), but this body wash is an exception.  The fragrance is light and appealing, and it dissipates quickly after the shower so I don't go around smelling like rotting fruit, which is how most fruit fragrances strike me.  It also makes it a nice choice for an all-family body wash, since no one will have to waft unwanted perfume all day.I also like that some consideration was given to the ingredients used to create this body wash.  After all, your skin is the largest organ of your body, and it's hard to think it's a good idea to regularly expose it to petrochemicals and artificial colors and scents.Most important, for me, is how my skin reacts to the product.  My skin is a little sensitive and easily irritated by some products, and it is dry, especially in the winter months.  I had no problems with the body wash and happily, I find I'm able to cut back on applying post-shower moisturizer, using it only every two or three showers, without getting the ashy skin and dry-skin itching that often plague me.  The bottle also claims that it 'brightens' skin, but I can't say I notice any difference.  My skin certainly isn't duller, but it looks pretty much the same as ever to me.  Presumably this claim is based on papaya being an exfoliant, but I doubt it is concentrated enough or remains on the skin long enough to have much exfoliant effect.I anticipate this nice big bottle lasting quite awhile, especially since I'm able to use just the right amount each time, but when it does run out, I will look for this brand again."
6311,1,"Excellent Ingredient Deck!_So many eye creams are often too emollient and they can cause milia, but not this one.  It is a great product, has a excellent ingredient deck, and is a nice consistency so it absorbs quickly.  It keeps my under eye area moisturized without making it greasy.This is my second purchase and I will continue to repurchase as needed."
3151,1,happy with product_I enjoy how soft this makes my hair. I am not true curly more wavy with frizzy dryness.  This line of products encourages and defines the frizzy into soft loose curls. Can't beat the price on line.
439,1,Hair Mask_Thank you for this hair mask.  I use it weekly and it softens and thickens my hair after putting it on before shampooing for 15 minutes to half an hour.
4866,1,"In LOVE! Matches my brows so well!_I always fill in my brows. I cannot go anywhere without filling them in, so its safe to say that ive gone through my fair share of different brow pencils and powders. Most of them got the job done but none of them every matched the color of my brows well. This brow pencil was reccommended to me by a friend and when i sadly shelled out $22 for it, i was pretty pleased with the product. $22 is a bit much but totally worth it to me because it matches perfectly!! I dont twist the pencil up too much as im worried it might snap, I also make quick and light strokes as to not snap the pencil as well. It blends out so well with the spooli brush too. I have medium brown eye brows and it works for me. If you have super blonde brows or black brows, this MAY not work for you as it may be too light for black brows and too dark for super blonde brows."
4424,1,"Great when used correctly_I like to apply this foundation with a dampened beauty blender sponge, but a dampened latex sponge would work just as well. You get the best full coverage with the sheerest amount of product this way."
1255,1,"Pretty good_Just started using this eye cream so I can't really give a full review yet but I have been using this eye cream for two days and this product you can use on your eyelids which people forget about and around and under eye area. This is a non-greasy,firming and smoothing eye treatment. I will give a future update."
7471,1,"This is for relaxed and natural hair, and it works very well!_I read some of the other reviews and, yes, some of the reviewers don't understand what a balm is.  You apply it to your hair and scalp after you've washed, conditioned and dried your hair (I suppose you could apply it to your hair before you dry it, too, but that's not how I use it).  It softens the hair and moisturizes.  I have natural hair (I'm African American), and this works really well to soften my hair.  Use a small amount.  The jar will obviously last a long time.  I'm not wild about the scent.  But after a while I don't notice it."
4915,1,"Reasonable improvement_This does improve lash length and thickness although not to the extent that Latisse does.  I was concerned about a change in eye color, so I did one eye first for about a month to make sure.  No problems with eye color change, and the lashes looked better. I think it is a good value for the money and will buy it again."
4713,1,Very Good Product!_Faithfully ever week I condition or deep condition my hair with heat. This cap works like a charm. I love it!
5801,1,"Better than alpha-hydroxy_I've been using alpha-hydroxy products for several years and have been very pleased with the way they make my skin look and feel so I thought I'd give this alternative a try. I've only been using it a few weeks, but so far, I'm very pleased with the results. It absorbs quickly with very little stinging (I have very sensitive skin so that's a consideration for me) and I definitely notice an improvement in the elasticity and texture of my skin. It doesn't seem to provide quite enough moisture for my dry winter skin so I usually let it absorb and then apply a layer of my usual moisturizer over it. I was starting to form little crow's feet, and after regular use I am pretty sure their appearance is significantly reduced, which is really pleasing... if it's any testimonial, I had a much younger literally gasp and scream 'no WAY!' last week when she asked how old I am, and I told her... she said she'd assumed I was ten years younger. Nice!"
7472,0,"DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT_I am not one to give a bad review for I like to find something good about a product. This has nothing good about it. It comes with no directions and I am not really sure what it is. The label says it is for scalp nourishment but I am not sure what that means. I opened up the jar to find a really buttery substance much like vasoline. I put a little on my scalp as I do have a problem with dry skin especially on my scalp but it was so greasy I could not stand it. BOY was I sorry, I could not wash it out fast enough and to my dismay it did not wash out right away and I had to keep washing my hair for a few days before it finally did come out. Needless to say the jar went into the garbage. Do not waste your money! Strangely enough the Clear Shampoo is really good product and I love it. This one is a bust!"
9528,1,"Suave Leave In Conditioner_I love a good leave in conditioner. It makes me feel like my hair is being protected from the elements while leaving some needed moisture on my fine, dry hair. This Suave leave in conditioner feels great in hand and smells fresh without being overwhelming. Since I do have rather fine hair that goes flat if I so much as look at it wrong, not to mention that I keep it rather short, I only use a dollop about the size of a quarter and that seems to be plenty.It leaves my hair soft and manageable and doesn&#8217;t leave an oily or heavy residue. Since my hair has gotten drier as I&#8217;ve gotten older I can&#8217;t wash it every day, and this conditioner doesn&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s collecting dirt like some sticky styling lotions or waxes seem to. But it works better if applied while the hair is wet so that it doesn&#8217;t weigh it down too much.I would recommend this as a good everyday conditioner when you need a boost of moisture and a little shine. I assume that a styling product would work well in tandem with this and still not be too heavy."
1719,1,"So pretty, nice-looking and vegan!_I know nobody likes to buy makeup on line when you can't test it, so I wanted to help people out. First, this particular color IS vegan (I don't know about any of the pink or red Ecco Bella lipsticks). Second, it doesn't dry your lips out or get cakey. Third, it works really nice as a wear-to-work lipstick because it is neutral and natural but has color. My coloring is fair skin, green eyes, and either deep red or dark reddish brown hair (I've worn it with both hair colors and it looks good with both). I can pretty much wear this with any clothing that I wear except maybe black and it looks good. Also, it is not deep brown--it is a nice light, but not frosty, brown."
5268,1,"This review is after 2 months of application. Results I can actually see._I have done A LOT of research on facial products. I have used and continue to use Vitamin C, Hyaluronic acid, Phloretin, E, Retina-A, LaGratiae's Lift, but nothing was giving me that &#34;wow, I LOOK different&#34; appearance.  I am only 34, and am an advocate of preventative maintenance, so maybe that &#34;WOW&#34; factor isn't going to be as obvious with the other products because maybe I am maintaining and preventing-- but I still wanted something that made me feel like my money was well-spent and something I could SEE. So, I did a lot of research on this product, read the trials, read the reviews, researched the ingredients etc. I purchased this April 6, Today is June 26. I waited to give a review after using it to give honest results. I can say this: This product has shrunken my pores, my skin IS smoother, it doesn't necessarily make it brighter (vit. c will) it just makes it look smoother, finer, and as if I had a laser procedure. Just as it promises. I can tell you, you don't find a lot of products that actually deliver what they say they will. It's empty promises of &#34;youth! No lines! Miracle Overnight!&#34; and you're left waiting to actually SEE the results. You can check my other reviews. I do not work for this company, and am RARELY an impressed buyer. But this product turned me from skeptic to regular consumer. If you buy the trial products, 4 of the small bottles lasted me 2.5 months. well worth $5 a bottle. Do research on the sellers, some are selling at $10 a bottle and you can find it cheaper."
3490,1,"Nice!_It's a good brush to apply powder or maybe even blush. I don't recommend it for liquid foundation as it is too soft. But all in all a good brush. Very soft, feels nice!"
5041,1,"awesome_the first i used it i can see the difference, it made my face a lot smoother and not many acne appears as they usually do. So i love this product."
8661,1,"Great Performance_Im a Degree deodorant fan, but i am now a fan of this Dove Antiperspirant and deodorant. It provides a long lasting protection for me because i am a little over weight and need all day coverage. A great alternative for me for Degree also because they have the same active ingredients and no irritants. I recommend this product."
8105,1,Works For The Entire Family_I chose this sunscreen for my entire family to use when we went on a trip to Lake Erie.  This product is basically odorless which really appeals to my husband and teenage son.  It moisturizes the skin without being greasy which is a big plus for me.  And we all made it back from a day on the lake without any burns!
2175,1,"Alba Bath Gel_I really like all of Alba's bath gels, and this one was good too. However, my one complaint is that the mint in this bath gel can be a bit overwhelming, so careful as not to use too much. It gives me a good clean feeling and I also like using this in my bubble baths. For the price, you can't beat it, one will pay far more at Whole Foods! I'd say try this and see for yourself."
7637,1,"Nice_Haven't actually used this yet, but looks like it will be great for a little something extra for nails.  Looks nice."
2901,1,The first time is always the best...!! It was love at first smell..!!_Everytime I have worn (used) this cologne I have received compliments from women.  The smell is a soft and clean scent that can be worn for any occasion.  The scent is very similar to Aqui Di (Armani) and Thallium Sport of which I recommend also.  The only complaint is the fragrance is light (soft) and does not last as long as other colognes.  The Amazon (and seller) service was first class.  Definitely add to your collection.
8453,0,"Eh :-/_This is loaded with silicones so buyer beware.Aside from that I was surprised that it barely has a scent. I love CLEAN products in general for their amazing scents but for some reason this barely has one. I don't know, maybe it's just the batch I got? I can't say, but it just barely smells at all. Next it is very thick. I generally don't like using thick conditioners because I have very fine hair and they weigh it down. I decided to keep using it anyway and I have yet to see a difference. Unfortunately, I have to chalk this up to just another fad treatment for your hair. I won't be buying this again."
7597,1,"Works wonders! Just like Shiseido!!!!_I read about this product on urbanbaby last night. Some said not worth it but saw it at Target today and decided I should give it a try. Nothing tinted has worked for me in the past, always too cakey. I have replaced foundation with Shiseido SPF 55 because the residue from this product gives the skin a porcelain glow. BB cream sort of does the same at a way cheaper price. Target is way cheaper than the price here btw."
5385,1,"No damage so far_I have fine, colour treated hair and while it is not curly, it gets fuzzy and looks like a halo of cotton candy when I wake up.  I have recently trained my hair to being washed 2-3 times a week instead of every other day.  Believe it or not, after you get over the initial greasy stage (can someone tell me how to use a dry shampoo effectively?) your hair is actually healthier and has more body.  Took a few weeks of pony tails but now I am glad I did it.Anyway, back to Three Days Straight.  I wash, condition, apply a leave in conditioner and a heat protector (the last step might be overkill) before applying this product.  Since I don't have much hair and it is very fine, straightening treatments make it completely flat so I sometimes apply a little mousse to the roots.  While my hair is still wet, I spritz 7-8 sprays of Three Days Straight into may hair avoiding the roots (might not work as well for those with very curly hair.)  I blow dry my hair quickly just to get it dry.  While my ends get fuzzy if I don't use a round brush, I have found that it ultimately makes no difference at all whether I make an effort to straighten it with the drier or not because in the end it is the straightening iron that does the real work.  After my hair is completely dry, I quickly run an iron through it (again avoiding the roots) and it looks super sleek and smooth and is often pretty soft as well.  Lately I've been wearing extensions for volume and even with sleek straight hair, if applied correctly, they don't show.  (I have used the Three Days Straight on my extensions but realise it is not really necessary.)Alcohol is one of the top ingredients so I try to use this only once a week although if I am going out a lot I may use it twice.  I pile my hair up loosely on my head at night and may have to touch up ever so slightly with the iron the following morning if the kink is in the wrong place.  Has worked well for me so far with no damage I can directly attribute to this product.  It's never felt sticky and is only greasy when it is already high time for another wash.  Not sure if it is the best thing for your hair but makes a big a difference in my appearance.  Will be using it until the next big thing comes out!"
1672,1,"smells awesome_It leaves a good smell and also my hair doesn't feel weird, it gets a very soft texture, but like extremely clean, but not frizzy."
3160,1,"Reminds me of my grandother_This product is amazing. When I used to put on other moisturizers it would leave my face feeing sticky and just sitting on top of my skin. With this my face feels so smooth and it doesn't just stay there It absorbs right into your skin. No sticky gross feeling and it is a pretty large container so lots of product. Plus it reminds me of my grandmother who used this Olay product all the time, so I get that memory of her when I use it. 5 stars all around."
6644,1,"i love it!!!!!!_I use almost all of them when I makeup myself, each one of them is so usefull, specially the small ones for my eyes and eyebrows. I recommend them!"
3204,1,"pretty color_This is a pretty color, however I saw the same eyeshadow for much less at my local beauty supply store. Nyx is a great brand,I plan on going to the beauty supply to purchase more colors."
4703,1,"My all-time favorite hair clips_Several years ago I bought a pack or two of these clips at a local discount store.  After a while, they disappeared into the nether (the same place rubber bands, clips and socks go to hide indefinitely) and I frantically searched around town to find them again-- to no avail.  I was ecstatic when I found them here on Amazon and promptly ordered a pack.  They are still my absolute favorite clips, nothing else quite compares.  I use this primarily for working out at the gym and for gymnastics.  They keep my thick hair completely out of the way without coming loose throughout my workout.  (Other similar clips just slide along my hair and don't 'cling'.)  They are also perfect for styling your hair down, particularly if it is thick and resistant to bobby pins and other conventional clips.Something also worth noting: In the Amazon product photo it shows two 'shiny gold' clips at the top, two 'shiny dark red' clips in the middle and two 'shiny black' clips at the bottom.  In reality, the colors are quite a bit different than the picture.  The top clips are gold-ish but more of a metallic-matte type color which does not reflect light like a piece of gold jewelry.  The middle clips are more of a pewter/silver metallic color which would look quite nice in any dark red or brown/black hair color.  Finally, the bottom clips are a solid black color.Highly recommended. All-time favorite!"
2828,1,"Silk_This shampoo/moisturizer is the best. It makes hair silky and smooth and it takes very little product when using. I go thru one conditioner to two shampoos so that helps cut the cost of the product. This pair is a dynamic duo, especially for probelm hair. It is very rich so a little bit goes a long way."
5771,1,"Worth every penny_Love this brush, so soft and flufly it's great, the only complain i have is that it's kinda small but other than that it's an amaaaazing brush. Highly recomend it!!"
4725,1,"Another fine product from Oil of Olay_It's fine but I prefer a cream.  And, it takes a while to see results.  It goes on easily and that's a plus and the price is right."
706,1,"Great Product_Aphogee Two Step Protein Treatment is amazing. It saved my hair when it was overprocess by relaxers and hair color. After using this treatment my hair stopped shedding and breakIng. My hair felt strong and soft...very impressive. This product should only be used if you're suffering moderate breakage or shedding. Well actually I've recently used it because my hair had been over conditioned and was left feeling mushy. I love this stuff,it works  miracles. The smell takes getting use to,but it's worth it. The procedure is a drag,but again worth it. This inexpensive product gets more than five stars from me."
6863,1,works great_i got these to clip fakies...and they work great...makes it easier to shape nails and get them the perfect length.
2367,1,"Absolutely LOVE this product!_I have been searching for a good foundation for a while now, and decided to give tinted moisturizer a try. I am soooo glad I did! I absolutely love CoverGirl Smoothers. I was a little hesitant with ordering the light to medium color since I love to tan a lot, but this moisturizer blends in with my skin flawlessly! Highly recommended that you give this a try, because you definitely won't be sorry. I will for sure keep buying this for years to come &lt;3"
7490,0,"Not for me_I have long permed and color treated hair and was hoping this produt would smooth out my hair and get rid of some of the frizziness. However, it just made it feel greasy and unclean.It is not a product I will use again."
705,1,"Helps to keep my hair moisturized.._One of the best leave in conditioners for black hair that I have tried. Yet if you add certain oils or hair dressing oils it builds up quickly or don't agree with the leave in conditioner. Use lightly, after you deep condition to repair and keep hair moisturized. Love it. Best leave in for the price."
4784,1,Love it_At first I wasn't sure how to use it but after playing around with it I got just the curls/waves I was looking for. Heats up fast and can leave you with a curl that actually holds. My mom got a hold of it and has since asked for one too; so for the great price it is a must buy.
1041,1,"Why don't you own this yet_I'm an idiot.  I have spent countless $5.00 on useless nail clippers over the years.  I thought it was normal to replace my nail clippers every few months.  The truth is, Tweezerman nail clippers are amazing.  They're solid.  They feel solid.  They cut my glitter-bedazzled nails without any give.  I cannot believe I've spent money on other brands. If you are considering buying some cheap knock-off, save your money and go for the cadillac of nail clippers."
4190,1,"Not grey like other BB creams_This is my 2nd tube. The first time I used it, I thought it was the best BB cream I have ever used. The color and consistency were great for combination skin. It is not grey color like other BB creams. But for some reason this 2nd tube is not really impressing me."
673,1,"It works best! I have tried & tested all black soaps..._I started out using this soap years ago. I am 34 years old now, I started using this soap back in my early to mid twenties maybe even late teens. More recently I have decided to go back to using Black Soap since no other over the counter products did much of anything for my occasional body breakouts. I purchased this particular black soap, but became interested in trying the 100% RAW AFRICAN Black Soaps as well (can be purchased online easily the brands I tried I will leave nameless, but they were authentic from AFRICA RAW BLACK SOAP, has a bumpy texture, and is Dark Brown in color). While Madina Black Soap works as well as I remembered (quickly clearing up the acne blemishes, & is a superb skin softener. I never get skin this soft unless I exfoliate with sugar scrubs, this soap is UN MATCHED when it comes to skin softening), while the real RAW African Soaps have done things like tighten my skin (must use moisturizer immediately afterwards, irritated my skin, it didnt clear up the acne as quickly as the 'Madina Black Soap' would have at all. After my last bar of the Madina Soap actually used up, I was disappointed (literally wishing I had purchased 6 bars instead of 2 bars), but took that opportunity to try the next Raw Black Soap from Africa, & while it was 'good' & 'smelled great'..it still didnt get rid of pimples or acne as well as The Bar of Madina Black Soap, nor did it soften my skin as well as the Madina Black Soap. I dont use this soap on my 'face', I use it strictly as a BODY BAR of soap in the shower & it works beautifully. You always know a good product when you keep coming back to it year after year after all others fail you. I am about to buy like 6 bars after this review! LOL"
5512,1,Just As Great As the Other Brand!_I already have a few Konad stamping plates. When I saw the MASH set I figured for the price it was worth seeing if they worked. You can get this whole set for the price of two stamping plates from the other brand. THESE WORK JUST AS WELL. I'm very happy with my purchase and now I can spend the money I saved on more nail polish!!!
4816,1,"Perfect!_Great product! This is the last part to your perfect manicure! I have used Gelish for over 3 months now and I just love it! Make sure to follow the You Tube video by the Harmony Gelish company on how to properly apply the product and you cannot go wrong! My nails look gorgeous and last 2 weeks minimum. The TOP IT OFF gives your nails that great shine that lasts for a long time.  I love how my polish doesn't chip, and they are harder than ever.  Using this product as directed in the Harmony Gelish You Tube Video  has caused ZERO damage to my nails, which is great because i have always had damage to them in the past whenever I had gel or acrylic overlay."
6500,1,"Cute set_Love ecotools and their price point. Very high quality. I have had this set for a long time and they havent shed on me or distorted. Very soft on your skin, blends everything seamlessly. Love ecotools have many other brushes from them would never buy another mac brush after discovering this brand."
7504,1,Consistently Good_I have been a fan of Essential Depot for a couple of years now and love their products.  Argan oil can be is very expensive but luckily I have found Essential Depot to get my oil.  Excellent price and as good as the expensive brands out there!  I use it for my hair to keep it soft and moisturized.  It is excellent for your skin as well.  Don't overpay just because it is a name brand.  This is an excellent oil!  I highly recommend.
8986,1,Wonderful Product!_I really liked this product. My skin felt so soft and hydrated after just the first use! It doesn't feel greasy and doesn't break out my sensitive skin. I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and I have noticed a big difference in my fine lines and wrinkles. I have gotten a lot of compliments lately about how radiant my skin looks and I make sure I tell everyone who asks about Oz Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum!
7652,1,"12 type heart deco_to cool, great for stationary.this is so colorful in the bounty of gifts i give out.  can you make this in little feet, for baby party or little cicles for christmas trees."
568,0,"Love Wen, hate Tee Tree Wen_I've gone through just about ever 'flavor' of Wen. I love the spring gardenia as it makes my hair soft and supple. I liked almond mint, winter cranberry and I really loved using summer mango coconut last summer. I also liked the aloe/cucumber. I have yet to try Lavender, but I will say that I did not like tee tree, fig or pomegranate. Those last 3 make my hair end up feeling like straw. I can feel it as soon as I rinse my hair after using it. I even used one pump (as suggested by Wen and other Wen users) as a leave in conditioner, thinking that it would soften my hair up,but after blow drying it comes out like straw every time. I hate it. My husband took a pix of the back of my hair and it was stiff like a broom. I will say that the tee tree does smell good and leaves a pleasant tingle on my scalp, but I detest the way it makes my hair feel. Naturally, my hair is already a tad on the dry side, shoulder length and very fine. Like I said before, the best one I've used so far was spring gardenia. It is about the only one that leaves my hair soft. But I will say that I totally disagree with Wen when they say they control frizz, because they do not. Even when I do use that one pump as a leave in at the end, I still end up needing a bit of hairspray to calm the frizzies. Some people would ask why I even bother with Wen instead of regular shampoo....Well, for me, it does make my hair feel clean even though it doesn't lather. I love the smell of it; it smells so clean and that lasts for hours. I managed to find the right one for me and should just stick with that, but I keep hoping that one of the ones I haven't tried yet will work even better than my favorite. I won't get another tee tree, but look forward to using the Lavender.I only gave one star to rate the product, NOT the seller. Seller was timely and professional."
778,1,OC eight professional mattifying gel_I received this as a sample and couldn't wait to order it!  I was so pleased I found it on Amazon.  This is one of the best products I've found to help 50 plus skin looks more radiant!  This product will now be a staple in my make-up routine!
5010,1,"Great for natural curly hair_I am a male and bought this because I have natural curly hair, which tends to be frizzy on the sides.  I use it after I get out of the shower and it helps keep my hair smelling nice and not as frizzy."
9597,1,"Easy use, works best when paired with another conditioner_I've tested this in a few ways, and been happy with all the results. The directions indicate to use after the Tresemme Renewal Deep Conditioner, and the two combined do make for softer hair. I usually wash my very thick hair about every 3 days, and I felt like the two together made my hair seem a bit less oily than normal by the time day 3 rolls around.I've also used it by itself, without any conditioner in the shower. Though it does help, I had to use quite a bit, and I think it is best paired with another conditioner. Which, that sort of defeats the point of a leave in conditioner for many. I was hoping to be able to use it on days I'm running late and save the minutes spent rinsing out conditioner. It is an option, just not as great as I'd like.I've also tried it with the usual conditioner I use, and it also had an added effect there. It made brushing through my hair easier, and seemed to control a bit of the frizz I tend to get.I'd say its best paired with the deep conditioner, but that's likely to be said of any product since, well, deep conditioner. But this is a great option for those rushed mornings, and has no smell to it."
1356,1,"GREAT PRODUCT WHEN COMBINED WITH KERAFUSE!_I give myself a protein treatment every six weeks and this was my first time using the Kerafuse along with the Hyrafuse. I have used the Hydrafuse once when I first purchased and it was okay but I heard it works better when combined with Kerafuse so I prepooed overnight, rinsed, shampooed with my aussie moist shampoo and then I applied my mixture(1 part Kerafuse and 2 parts Hydrafuse) for about 45 minutes with my heat cap and then rinsed out.  WOW!!!! I can't believe how soft my hair was!! It was so soft and shiny and it looked great!  This will definitley be my go to mixture for my protein treatments from now on! This was one of if not the best hair wash day I have ever had!"
3214,1,"Definitely worth the money works great with IBD, Gelish and Shellac_This lamp is very good. I also have the 36 watt cheaper lamp as well and I prefer this one.  Definitely worth the difference in price. This lamp  large enough to fit both hands in at once or both feet in at once. I have personally used with the IBD Builder Gels, Gelish and Shellac and the all cure great. For those having issues in curing make sure that you are wiping the final layer off with alcohol. Gel polish is not like regular polish the polish remains tacky as you dry each layer. Once you dry the final top coat the tacky finish needs to be removed with alcohol. Another reviewer mentioned that this lamp works great with the OPI Gelcolor as well.  I can't wait to try this lamp next with OPI Gelcolor hopefully the polish will show up in the mail soon.I did have an initial issue in getting the lamp to start but that had to do with my incorrectly installing the bulbs I did no push them in far enough once that was corrected the lamp has worked great."
5889,1,"Really Impressed!_I am always a little skeptical about buying eyeliner since I have had such a hard time finding one that doesn't smear and smudge after a few seconds of wearing it.  I was very surprised at how well this actually stays in place.  I wanted to test it out so I put it on at night before I went to bed and slept with it on.  I was stunned when I woke up in the morning and it was still perfectly intact!  It did not smear or anything.  I added another coat over it for my work day and I checked at lunch and it was still as perfect as before I left my house.  The only thing is that the grey color looks kind of blueish on my skin, maybe it is just how it blended with my under eye concealer.  Otherwise, I am really impressed with how well this product actually works.  I would definetly recommend it to everyone!"
8842,1,"Recommend highly for girls that love make up! Variety... long delivery_Update: So I finally got to trying out a pair and I'm in love!! Definitely worth the purchase.I tried the first time with just a black pair with flowery designs at the outer corners b/c I could touch it up with black liquid eyeliner if it didn't work. I cut as much excess white as I could. Cutting as close to the black as possible. The first eye I started placing at the inner corners and for whatever reason that inner corner didn't get any black color on it. For the second eye I started placement at the outer corner with the flowers then wetted the tattoo down to the inner corner. Worked ALOT better. All together it took me maybe 10 mins to do both eyes. Took about 1-2 mins of wetting for each eye. Once on, they do not feel weird or uncomfortable.I'm in love with them! They look gorgeous on. I would definitely recommend for girls that are into makeup and have a bit more experience with them. Especially if you're using them on yourself. The average girl might not have the patience or practice with eye make up and want to bother with it.Original: I haven't tried them yet... but speaking to the variety I did not get any regular black ones. The all black ones I did get had the flowery designs at the end. I got three all black, the rest have some sort of color. I got 40 pairs... 3 were duplicates. So excited that I got the rainbow pack!They do take a while to arrive.Looking forward to using! Even if they don't work out it's a fun experiment imo.. I seriously do hope I can muster my make up talent to make these work though..."
4678,1,"One of proactivs best!_I love this product. I had acne break outs in high school and used the three step process. It seemed to help. But 8 years later, after I got married I was able to find that using this toner after the deep cleansing wash was a much better regimen for my face.  It is less drying for me but still cleanses.

6064,1,"The answer to UD's 24/7 Perversion_I got this in black. I was running down the 24/7 UD liner that I got in the 15h anniversary set. Zero just wasn't dark enough. UD is only putting perversion into specialty sets it seems, so I didn't know what to do. And then the girl at Sephora told me about this. It's pretty much the same thing. You have a little time to blend, then it stays put until you're ready to take it off. It glides on smoothly and leaves a nice dark line. I don't think I'll ever use the smudger at the bottom. I'm really really happy with this eyeliner."
962,1,"Get Ready for BRIGHT Pink!_An extremely intense pink color that goes on smoothly and easily. I have medium dark hair so I bleached before applying. (I used Manic Panic's Amplified Bleach. If you are doing a lot of hair, or your hair is long, I would get 2 bleach kits if you are using this particular brand.) Manic Panic is easy to apply - just apply the color where you want it, leave it (I left it for about an hour), rinse out. And rinse out. And rinse out. lol Expect to turn your towel blue - for the next couple of washes. The less you wash your hair, the longer it stays. After a few washes, this color will turn a nice shade of pastel pink. (Still pretty.) If you want seriously bright pink hair, just recolor it when it begins to fade. It's MUCH easier to color the second time, since you most likely will only have to apply the color - not bleach. Right after coloring, be careful - ANYTIME your hair gets wet, the color WILL run. (It will also get under your nails when you scratch your head.) These minor annoyances don't bother me enough to stop using Manic Panic...but I would want to know this stuff before I used it.Bottom Line: Manic Panic is the BEST product out there for coloring your hair funky shades. It lasts much longer than any other brand I've tried, it's easy application makes re-touches &#34;cake&#34;, and the colors are bold and brilliant. I wouldn't hesitate to use this brand, or color, again. You definitely make a statement! (If you want a pastel shade to begin with, buy their Pastel-izer. It will turn any bold shade of Manic Panic into a subdued pastel.) ManicPanic.com is full of awesome information and great tips. There's even a spot where they show what the hair color looks like on real people.Best part? The don't test any of their products on animals. YAY!"
323,1,"Love his product!_This is probably the best toner I have ever used. It does not dry out your skin, it is very gentle. I will definitely repurchase. The bottle lasts a long time too!!!"
3102,1,it really works_it really works i first i dont think i would but i want to see i was really superised that it did work im 20 year old and i have some wrinkles on my fourhead and by my eyes  but you must try this realy works!
18,1,"Grandpa?_I'm a lady, and I bought this because I needed a quick, in-office fix to fuzzy legs. Sometimes you miss a patch. Or the whole thing...Anyway, I did a side by side comparison. One leg I shaved dry and one I used this stuff.This stuff works great, I had a much closer, smoother shave than without it. But, it made me smell like an old man. It has a very potent 'classic aftershave' smell that is just not my cup of tea, as a lady who doesn't want to smell like a great uncle, or for someone I would consider getting close enough to to smell their face.Now I understand why it says 'rinse after using'. That being said, it's still a great product, and I'd buy it again."
8069,1,"Best Shampoo I have ever tried...._This has to be the best shampoo I've ever tried. I have an oily scalp, and dry ends, which means that some shampoos dry out my hair, or make me look like a greasy dirty mess. I also get dandruff from some shampoos, and even worse is the ITCHING. Every shampoo before has given me itching, some the same day, some the next, but always itching.With this shampoo my hair is clean, barely any dandruff, and NO ITCHING! It is amazing, i wash my hair on Monday, and i dont have to wash it again until Thursday, so i can take two days off washing. Which is incredible because in the past the itching or the oily hair wouldnt let me last that long. By thurday my hair is a bit oily but im trying to grow out my hair, so i ignore it.i do get a small amount of dandruff, but i think thats normal since im taking two days between washing, its not there the first day though. By the way, I tried some other Shampoo/Conditioners in the Yes to Carrots line, and some of them did give me itching, or oily hair, the best one for me was this scalp one. =)I recently tried an organic shampoo i found on amazon, worked the first day, and the next day the itching returned. I think im just going to stick with Yes to carrots, the ingredients arent too bad, and it works, thats all that matters to me. =)Ive tried:Tea tree shampoos (dried out my hair, still itching). I tried the No poo method, dry and oily patched hair, still itching (tried for one month!). Dandruff shampoos, Sulfate free shampoos, expensive shampoos, cheap shampoos, for normal, oily, and dry hair. Nothing else worked..."
7902,1,Great price!_Took a couple of weeks to get.. But i know that. This is a great deal !! It cost $6 for 2 or 4 in the store..Definitely  durable for the hair . (not junk) I would recommend!!
8794,1,"hair pin_this one is really pretty.  the picture does not do it justice, much prettier in person.  thank you so much."
7882,1,HELPS ME A BUNCH!_GREAT PRODUCT!! Helps me outline my eye browns and all I have to do is wash them if they get dirty! Thank goodness!
2911,1,"Silky smooth and easy on the face_I have Roseacea and can't use just any lotion as they make my face break out.  Not this!  It is wonderful and I can't live without it.  Just a tiny amount goes a long way and restores elasticity after I wash my face.  I love it.  I threw out all of my Aveeno products that were supposed to alleviate redness but were filled with chemicals and I've gone completely to 100% Pure products and boy, am I ever glad I did."
8985,1,"Best product EVER!!!_I had to wait a little bit for this product due to its high demand but wow was it worth it !! I have only been using product for a few days but the results were pretty much instant.  Having work at Macys cosmetic counters I was able to try the latest and greatest from several lines, but this product literally blows them out of the water! I am so happy I found this product and can guarantee that I will continue using it.  Many thanks to Oz Naturals to putting out such a wonderful product and for unbelievable customer service  ... God bless.Diana M Devlin"
9580,1,"Suave is getting smarter_age: 56skin type: slightly sensitive and dry in winter.I'm loving that Suave is experimenting with its products! Making it affordable in a time when I need affordable products--not every beauty product has to cost a lot to be effective. I admit it's been years since I've tried Sauve products, so these new lines (I have some of their new shampoo, too, that I love) give me a chance to explore.First off, the scent is lovely. Sometimes scented products are too flowery, or have an &#34;old lady scent&#34; (okay, I'm 56, I'm in that category perhaps, but I'm talking our grandma's old lady products :D ), or have a slightly &#34;chemical&#34; scent mix with whatever they think smells good. But this Suave product really does have a wonderful scent that makes it a pleasure to apply . . . mmmmmmmmm! I'm wearing it now with nothing else -just the lotion - just kidding; I have on clothes - you don't have to stab your eyes out *teeheehee* . . . .It smooths on the skin pleasantly, and leaves my skin soft and silky.So, thank you, Sauve - I need some affordable beauty products until my novels make me millions (hahahahahahahaha - dang). Worth the five-star rating, yeah."
3280,1,good Facial Wash for troubled skin_Even at my age (I will not tell how old) I occasionally get minor breakouts.  My 23 year old daughter has very troubled skin.  We both have been using this Wash for several weeks now and it seems to be making a difference.  For my daughter it seems to be helping to get her skin clean enough that the other medication that she uses is clearing up her face (she is required to wear makeup every day to work).  For myself it seems to be helping me not to get a breakout.  I hae not had one since I started using this product.  Works great for us!
9610,1,"Love this product!_This is one of the best eye serums I've used.  Definitely can feel the tightening (i.e. lift) this product offers.  Some will still need to use retinal along with this product, but using retinal alone will not deliver as much as using it in conjunction with this product.  This is a must use!"
1541,1,awesome cream_This cream is awesome it takes care of drynesss with out clogging your pores i have very sensitive skin and have no problems with it.try it is worth every penny. i have bought creams for 3 times this amount that did nothing. and you can use it all over your body it is really nice has no smell or greasy after effect like some creams..love it!!!! and i have roscea and believe me it helps it
2402,0,"Waste of money_I have many items I use for my hair.  These were by far the worst ones I have ever used.  It takes a very long time to get your hair tied up and wounded down.  It isn't worth it.  If you have the long pipe item, then that is the way to go.  It takes two minutes for those guys as opposed to one hour for this one.  Don't buy it."
8073,1,Not much you can say here_Great quality cotton rounds. I use them for my facial astringent every morning-- much cheaper than in Target or CVS but same great quality. Love them!
8620,1,"Weightless Moisture Conditioner_I've been using this Conditioner with the Weightless Moisture shampoo. My hair feels clean and soft without feeling heavy. They keep the frizzies away, and don't leave behind any build up. The scent is clean, but not overpowering."
5201,1,"Excellent, affordable must-have for your brushes_I invest in professional grade brushes, so this product was a no-brainer.  The Shadow/Liner Package comes with an excellent variety of skinny Brush Guards which keep my investments in as-new shape.  I don't know how I ever did without them.  I can't recommend them highly enough."
372,1,"better than I expected_When it arrived I was very surprised by the color..it appears more pink in the photo...in actuality it is more bronze/gold, but once I applied it... it looks and blends beautifully...the blush color is gorgeous. I am sure it will enhance a varity of skin tones. I am very happy with the purchase of NARS Blush, Orgasm."
825,1,"Honeysuckle goodness!!_This is one of my favorite scents of all time. It's made with real honeysuckle. You know on a spring day when you walk pass a honeysuckle bush and you can't help but stop and take in that wonderful scent? You'll smell like that, but even better, because it's Estee Lauder :)"
5979,1,"Beautiful Colors_I received this package the day after I ordered it! None of my bottles were broken and it was packed very well with lots of bubble wrap and foam peanuts. The paint brushes are very fine wich is perfect for painting nail art, but you wouldn't want to use these to paint you entire nail. Great color range. Perfect for any nail polish collection."
5734,1,"MAC Cosmetics, watch out._I have a few MAC brushes that I have had forever.  They're good brushes and good quality.  I recently decided to get a powder brush, the biggest I could find.  I already have a MAC powder brush, but wanted something bigger and better, but didn't want to spend $40+ on a brush.I tend to avoid inexpensive brushes because they shed and the blending abilities aren't the best, but then.  WHOA, HOLD ON.  Real techniques brush just freaking blew my mind.  It is inexpensive and it works the same, if not better, than expensive brushes.I washed the brush before I used it and could not get over how soft and fine the bristles felt.Once the brush dried, I used it to apply Makeup Forever's HD Microfinish Powder and holy beautiful skin that will make people jealous, Batman.This brush and that powder are going to do some amazing things together."
2639,1,"Met all of my expectations_Feels nice on face when applied at night, although hydration seems to disappear by morning.  Will continue to use it and see how it goes"
7315,1,"Diggin' on this product_I am really really loving this product; yes, this is a smaller size, but when changing or trying something new, I like to spend as little as possible to see if I like it or not.  I really do like this......it's moisturizing and preps the face; it seems tinted slightly white but that disappears immediately; the perfect canvas for your foundation.  I'm very happy.  I am 54 and have been using Laura Mercier and it was fine, just wanted something a bit more affordable....love this."
4371,0,"Just Ok, Not Great_I have used Johnson & Johnson products for many years, due to having sensitive skin.  I don't have children.I found this head-to-toe foaming baby wash to be disappointing.  First of all, in reading the ingredient list on the back of the bottle, it seems to me that this product also has alot of the same ingredients that products that do not claim to be 98 % natural, like this one does.I would have preferred essential oils versus the scent that this product has, which I really don't care for.  This product is essential oil free.  At least essential oils tend to be natural, and smell alot better.  Maybe this is more an adult choice than if you were to use this on a baby, or small child.I wanted to get this thinking since it's a foaming baby wash, I could also use it to wash my hands, since it's milder, since I do tend to wash my hands alot with handwash, which tends to leave my nails brittle, then they break.I've also been using baby wash for years, to shave under my arms, and my legs.  It works wonderfully!  I never nick myself, plus baby wash does not clog up your razor, like shaving cream does.One last thing, I had a heck of a time getting the plastic off the dispenser top.  I think the product had been leaking when I received it, so I washed it off, but I still had a hard time getting the plastic off. It took me almost 5 minutes to do it!  It sure did NOT come off in one piece!I like Johnson & Johnson as a company, and would still continue to use and try their old and new products, however, I don't think I would buy this product for myself.  I do like their lavender and chamomile scented products tho."
2184,0,You too can look like a party animal with nice red eyes_The first time I used this product it burned my eyes.  My eyes were bloodshot and puffy.  I have never had this kind of a reaction to any mascara previously. Very disappointed.
6896,1,SMELLS SO GOOD_THIS ORDER HERE TOOK A FULL MONTH TO GET TO ME. I WAS GOING TO RETURN IT SO I WENT TO RETURN AND IT WAS GOING TO COST ME$36.SO I WAS LIKE NO .BUT WHEN I OPENED IT OMG THE SMELL IS SO SO GOOD SO I AM GLAD I KEPT IT .BUT WILL NOT REORDER TAKES A MONTH WAY TO LONG
1780,0,"Longer growth but not MORE growth_This product I used for months and months and didn't get more than a few new hairs and that could've been just due to the time spent using this. On the other hand it will make uour eyebrows and lashes grow longer so if you're looking for a cheap way to grow your eyebrows or eyelashes longer and that's it, then this could be a very cheap fix for you. And this product lasts a really long time without running out so it wouldn't be a waste of money for that purpose. But if you're trying to actually grow more eyebrow hairs go with Billion Dollar Brows instead. Brow Boost. I have used that for less than a month so far and it's already filling out the sparser parts of my eyebrows!"
2848,1,"Amazing scent_I've been using this for about a month now. As far as firming? Don't see even a slight difference. BUT, I will be reordering this for sure. The scent is amazing and it gives my skin moisture and a unobtrusive shimmer that makes it look very healthy."
327,1,"Wonderful!_I was really nervous about purchasing this product due to the fact that I have very oily/acne prone skin and not to mention the fact that I suffer from eczema. However, since using the product I haven't experienced any breakouts or reactions, the product smells so good, and it leaves my skin feeling so soft. When I wake up in the morning I seem to have this nice glow. Also I was a little concerned about the price since the product is a little on the small side however, this will definitely last a VERY long time so the price was well worth it.."
9542,1,"DOES WHAT IT SAYS_I have to admit I was skeptical, but I decided to try SUAVE PROFESSIONALS SPLIT ENDS RESCUE CONDITONER, 12.6 OZ, just the same. My daughter has dry, course, frizzy hair, with lots of flyaways due to breakage. I was a little more than surprised that after only a few uses, SUAVE PROFESSIONALS SPLIT ENDS RESCUE CONDITONER seemed to tame the flyaways. The fragrance is subtle, yet pleasing, the consistency runnier then most conditions I&#8217;ve experienced, which translates into rinsing out easier. The bottom line &#8230; it does what it claims to do.Product Description:&#8226; Salon proven to strengthen hair as well as paul Mitchell&#8226; Up to 70% split end reduction with 3 uses of split end rescue shampoo and conditioner vs. Non-conditioning shampoo alone&#8226; Enriched with PEC complex&#8226; Important Information&#8226; IndicationsFor questions, visit [...] or call us at 1-800-782-8301.IngredientsIngredients: Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Behentrimonium Chloride, Fragrance (Parfum), Dipropylene Glycol, Lactic Acid, Polyquaternium-28, Amodimethicone, Potassium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Cetrimonium Chloride, PVM/MA Copolymer, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, MethylisothiazolinoneDirectionsApply.

4873,1,Bold and Fun Lashes!!!!!_Want bold and fun lashes? Then place your order. These lashes are strong and hold up well. If you want a more natural lash then these are not for you. These lashes make a statement for those of us who want that full and bold lash look. Would recommend and buy again. Thanks.
6209,1,"LOVE LOVE LOVE_I love this product so much, it's PERFECT. I am a big fan of nail designs so i highly recommend this product."
3436,0,"Heavy cream with an unpleasant scent_I used Olay products for years and trusted the brand name for a long time. This product doesn't turn me off of Olay products - although I've tried to switch my health and beauty products to ones that have ingredients I can actually pronounce - but I really did not like the Olay Regenerist DNA Superstructure UV Cream.The cream is not so creamy. It's quite heavy and difficult to smooth on to my skin. Even when I use just the small amount dispensed by the pump, it takes a while to rub it in, and then if I am out in the sun, sweating makes the stuff run down my face. Also, there is a very strong perfume scent to the product (it makes me sneeze), and I found that not only did I have that same scent on my face, it was nearly impossible to wash off my hands after using the cream, so I end up smelling the stuff that makes me sneeze throughout the day.I had to stop using this product after a few attempts. It just doesn't work for my skin or lifestyle."
6246,0,"drying_This shampoo is extremely drying, I would only recommend it for fine oily hair. It doesn't seem to have any conditioner."
9472,1,"It took care of the problem._My little granddaughter had a little patch of eczema on her arm. You could hardly see it, but you could certainly feel it. I think it's something we caught early. We started using this cream on it after every bath and started noticing improvement within a few days. Within a week, we could neither see nor feel any roughness.The cream is not only effective, but it absorbs quickly and hardly has a scent. She made no complaint when we rubbed it in, so it obviously didn't bother her. (She's pretty effective at letting us know when something bothers her!) Even though the problem seems resolved, we continue to use it almost every day as protection because, for some reason, that has been a problem area in which dryness seems to come and go."
2437,1,"Really works!_Have been using this a while .Amazons price is better. Your brow will appear higher, and your eye more open. It lifts and highlights. Cant live without it. A must have."
3569,1,"Bought it again and again_I swear I have never used a brand of face toner a bottle after another. I have used Burts Bee for years and I love the smell. It feels clean after I apply it. I don't mind a little bit of alcohol if the product works on my skin. Tried many brands like Estee Lauder, Shishedo, Neutrogena, Clean and Clear, Ponds, etc but didn't feel clean or refresh. I have large pores and my T zone is oily. I cannot say Burts Bee Garden Tomato stops the shine but it slows it down. My T zone will be super shine if I forget to apply this toner or switch to another brand."
4592,1,"Smells good._Nice clarifying/cleansing mask. Smells more like chocolate than strawberries. Seems to do a good job of cleansing, and the price is right."
7530,1,"Love!_First off, the shipping was super fast! Now this color is amazing, very girly. Alot of pigment for such a cheap lipstick. Its a matte lipstick, so its slightly drying. The only problem I have is the packaging, but overall a great lipstick :)"
6907,1,"I wouldn't call this a sea salt spray, but it is a fabulous spray to make your hair silky._I love the pricey &#34;Davines More Inside Sea Salt Spray&#34; which makes my hair feel as though I've just come in from the beach. The Toni & Guy spray is less money, so I thought I'd try it out. It doesn't give my hair that just in from the beach feeling (i.e., wind blown, salty and curly), but it makes for a marvelous spray on conditioner that leaves my hair soft and silky and curly. I gave it four stars because it doesn't leave my hair with that wind blown feeling you get after leaving the beach, but instead seems to be a better conditioner spray than texturising product. Different looks for different moods!"
2861,1,Great color!_Very well packaged and shipped fast! I loved this color and couldn't wait to put it on as soon as I got it! Perfect spring color!
2671,1,"pampering lather_I love this richly lathering, skin-pampering soap! Your skin will be smooth and supple...soft and touchable. I enjoy the scent on my skin. I do recommend using an aerated soap dish which will allow the bar a better chance to dry between uses."
133,1,Excellent  but........._The zinc molecules are too large to absorb into your skin leaving the skin with a ' chalk ' like look.  Will without a doubt block the harmful UVA / UVB rays.If you're into protection 100 % this is for you. If you're vain.......don't complain.
474,1,"very cool brush_soft on the scalp, and in between the long bristles there are little ones that help straighten and remove and fuzz or anything in your hair.  This a great bush I use on my daughters hair as well as mine.  So gentle she does not mind it."
5538,1,"Love_I Love this product. It's great FOR your hair. It always leaves my hair feeling silky smooth, but don't put TOO much or you will just have greasy hair by the end of blow drying it. just a few sprays and your good. TRUST ME."
8476,1,Works great._This product works great and does an excellent job oh holding up spiked hair. Put this on in the morning and it was still working at the end of the day. Product leaves hair hard and spiked up. If you do use a little too much there might be some whit residue. A little bit goes a long way with product. Will definitely use again.
4107,1,love_love this gel eyeliner its so black super black which is awesome and goes on smooth this is second one im getting and the other still isnt dried out just running out love...
2438,1,Finally nails growing_After too many years of acrylics I wanted to be natural. Years ago I tried nail trek but it didn't work. Tried it again a couple of months ago and finally nails r getting hard and growing. I luv the product but certainly was surprised at how tiny these bottles are
4711,1,"Has transformed my hair's condition_This is the equivalent of going out in the sun with a cap on and some heavy conditioner.I put on a heavy conditioner, pop this hat on for 15 minutes, and my hair is in much better condition after a few weekly treatments."
5264,1,"Great_I had never been a fan of foundations, only used to wear translucent powder before.  So I can't compare with other foundations.  But I can say that I love the combination of natural ingredients that feed the skin plus the spf benefit.  I like this much better than an spf cream and the finish is much nicer, more matte, than the tinted spf moisturizers I had tried.I put one small dab on each cheek, one dab on my chin and one dab on mu forehead and I spread with a brush.  Works like a charm.  Ingredients include aloe, jojoba, rice powder, minerals like titanium dioxide, zinc oxide and mica.  I am a light medium complexion that is not dark but tans easily, and the golden peach blends in effortlessly."
284,1,"Very nice_Natural, not heavy, greasy, and doesn't have a perfume odor.  The only drawback is that it stings a bit when getting too close to eye."
8943,0,"Dissapointed_When this hairpins only come I was happy, because it looks gorgeous. But when I put it on my hair it just fall down. This hair stick does not work properly, it does not keep on my hair."
3899,1,"Shimmer_I am not a huge fan of shimmer, that's just my personal opinion, but I really like this palette. You get a good range of colors and there is a lot to work with to make any kind of makeup style."
2486,0,"Fake!_A friend of mine borrowed my Moroccan oil and accidentally took it home with her. Being that she lives very far away she said she would just keep it and buy me a new bottle. I told her just do Amazon it looked like a good price. Well, I have used this oil and put it in gift baskets for friends for years and this product is fake. If the price is too good to be true then it is. The label, the box, the smell, how it makes your hair feel. All fake."
6746,1,Easy for Traveling_NYX LOVE!
6569,1,Awesome product! Works perfect!_I had a couple of them in the past - and these one are my favorite now! They are double-side what I like the most.
2107,1,Review_Awesome scent my girlfriend loves it so I use it rarely along with my other Colognes cheaper then Wal-Mart price this bottle should last me for years
5792,0,"Disappointing purchase_So disappointing after everything Ive read on this 'snail goo' phenomenon. The smell is awful and too fragranced, over powering to say the least. But most importantly,  I didnt see any noticeable results that are claimed.. Maybe if I purchased one that was 100% organic?"
4806,1,"Great for oil absorption!_I love these oil absorbing sheets.  I found out about these from a fellow oily faced person that swore by them.  I have tried numerous ones in the past and they either did not absorb enough oil or they left my face with a ghastly white hue because they deposited powder. The fact that the sheet turns clear once it has absorbed oil is satisfying...so you know if you have to use another sheet.  Also, my makeup stays intact and appears refreshed after use.  I keep these in my purse and at my desk at work.  I definitely recommend them."
8023,1,"Buy it!_This is the best drugstore brand mascara I've ever had. No clumps, with 2 or 3 coats you will look like you have fake lashes. HIGHLY recommend, you won't regret it."
5335,1,"Love it!!!!_I love, love, love this.  This has helped my eye shadow stay on all day.  It didn't crease or disappear through out the day"
9615,1,"This stuff is awesome!_All I need is a few drops in my hand to keep my hands moisturized or to rub into the ends of my hair to keep my hair frizz free and fabulous looking!  And bonus, it has a very light scent, not overpowering at all like some essential oils!  A winner!"
3870,1,"Nyx will never let you down!_I wish I had known about nyx years ago, all the money I have spent on eyeshadow could be used for EVEN more eyeshadow ;)Great feel and the saturation is fantastic, very comparable to mac!"
9335,1,"Fekkai Essential Shea Shampoo_This shampoos worked great, smells wonderful.  Easy to use and no need for a conditioner afterwards. It left my hair soft and somewhat silky.  My wife really liked it but it is pricey and somewhat out of our budget range."
9028,1,"softens retains moisture well_I like this whipped butter. It  applies easily and absorbs well.  I live in the mountains where the air is very dry.  I have tried many products to help my skin from drying, cracking.  some products just dont absorb, some are too greasy, and some dont make any difference. This shea butter softens and restores dry hands, feet, legs...I use it on my face. I like it. It has a pleasant fragrance. fast shipping."
7146,1,"Another Very Nice Product from this Line_I have been pleased with every item I have tried from the Mtions Naturally You line and this hair masque is no exception. The 8-ounce container is a nice size and will last for quite awhile. I like how my hair feels after usage. Having color-treated hair, I have to be careful what I use, and I find this product does an excellent job in deep conditioning my hair. Would recommend."
2223,1,"New co-wash staple_This is great for co-washing my 3b/3c curly hair. It has great slip, nice smell and it's pretty thick. Price was nice and shipping was fast."
4548,1,"best oil controling spray_I bought this spray at Sephora some time ago thinking that it would be good for setting make up and oil control, as the name would suggest; but being combination skin,I found that it was more effective in reducing the oil production on my face than setting my makeup. It does not  keep my face oil free for the entire day if it is humid. Any other day, it works very well. It recommends 2-3 sprays but I use about 6, just because of my skin. I would highly recommend this spray/"
6291,1,"Will buy again._I love roc products, but I can't use them exclusively since I still need something to prevent acne. Ugh. Anyway, these disks are kind of huge; I can do my whole face, neck and chest with one. Might need to cut them in half like others do. I also use a neutrogena exfoliating cream wash, but I actually think this is somewhat more effective. I'm going to alternate them...this one is somewhat more time consuming to use.Update: Okay... I was wrong. These are the freaking amaze-balls super awesome perfect exfoliation product. I mean, this is the holy grail, right here. The price is right, they WORK. My skin looks better than is ever EVER has -- when I use them regularly. For me, maybe 2-3 times a week is enough. The other days I can cleanse with regular old Neutrogena Oil free acne wash or whatever I'm into at the moment. My skin is very acne prone, and this actually is helping to prevent break outs. It's also done WONDERS in improving the texture of my skin-- it looks more fine and smooth, almost like a pre-adolescent's baby face!! I went for some weeks neglecting to use this product and started wondering what the heck I wasn't doing right, because I just kept looking crappier and crappier, and then I remembered these. ONE week back on, I look fantastic again. AMAZING."
7775,0,HATE THIS COMPANY!_I paid for my palette two months ago and never received it! These people did not even message me back when I asked where it was and I had waited 3 months for it! You would be smart to stay away from this company and look elsewhere. Worst service I have ever encountered in my life and I never plan to buy anything off of this company again!
1799,0,"Too Oily For This Aging Face_I have to admit I suffered from oily skin all through my youth and young adulthood so maybe I shouldn't be surprised that now that I'm in my forties a product with the word oil in it is still too greasy for my face.  I will say Bio-Oil works fine for me as a moisturizer for my hands, feet, elbows etc. but I all ready have body lotion products I like that work as well and with a more pleasant scent for less money though granted a little drop of this stuff does go a long way.  I also tried Bio-Oil on some stretch marks and saw no improvement after a couple of weeks.  Everyone is different so I'm willing to believe this product may do miraculous things for some people but I am not one of them."
6112,1,"WONDERFUL!_My daughter loves changing her nail style often, and she likes to play around with mine, as well.I purchased some tools and some bead sets, and she's been having a blast.This wheel is perfect - 12 colors, tons of rhinestones, and so much fun!"
8880,1,"Beautiful color_This color is awesome, the online picture doesn't even do it justice. One of my favorites. Super pretty deep purple. Great for any season."
1808,1,"Bring' the 90's Back_I love these things.  I only wear  them around the house though, I'll admit.  In any case, they're comfortable, stretchy, and hold my hair very well!"
5049,1,My Favorite Drugstore Lipstick_Love this lipstick. It competes very well with my holy grailEstee Lauder Estee Lauder Signature Hydra Lustre Lipstick - Black Cherry(I love the full line not just the one color given in the link) though with a much smaller price tag. Kiss and Temptation are my two favorite shades but as I am now enrolled in a makeup school I have 13 different shades and they are amazing. I plan to buy the others shades and fill up my lipstick palette soon. They really add moisture to the lips and last a very long time. You will usually need to touch it up every few hours but not unreasonably so. The colors are gorgeous and I have not noticed any bleeding. Love them!
8774,1,"Another Great Dove product_Dove has long been known for a high quality skin care line , providing excellent results at a reasonable price. This latest offering seems to be no exception.The conditioner is meant to be used daily without damaging the hair. A very soothing , comforting feeling washes over you as you rinse this from your hair.Although used daily ,  only a small amount is needed making the 8 ounce bottle last for a considerable amount of time."
1060,1,"Great and very inexpensive!_This stuff is great, especially for the price! I use this along with Moroccan oil deep conditioner a couple times a week.  My hair feels a bit stronger and more shiny.  This has got to be the best bang for your buck out there.  Recommend and will continue to use"
6507,1,"No bother to me_Ok I have this product. No chemically smell, no chemical bomb smell, I think the bad raters got a bad can of it. Mine has no white residue neither. I used quick ' shots' or ' bursts' it brushed right thru! No oiliness, no residue, no nothing! This stuff really does work! I'd recommend buying it at Wal-Mart like I did though. It was totally worth $3 I spent. I tried Pantene dry shampoo. I hated it. It had tapioca in it. Left white on my clothes, sink, and hair. If it has tapioca in it, don't buy it! It's not worth the embarrassing white residue. Sorry some of you hated this product, but, I'd take my advice and go buy it in the stores."
758,0,"Looks like 100% aloe but isn't_Looks like 100% aloe vera gel, but isn't.  Didn't work at all.  Ordered the lidocaine version from the same company and it healed right away plus no pain."
3235,1,"hair clips_bought these awhile back, still use em every day. ive found, these are the only type of hair clips to actually stay in my hair. DEFINITELY worth the buy!"
4300,1,"Wonderful Product for Heavy, Thick Hair, too_I have super straight, thick, heavy hair.  A lot of styling aids like wax and balms weigh my hair down rather than supporting the syle. Powder Play keeps my volume without weighing it down.  It also keeps the shine in my hair.  Just lift hair at the crown where you want volume, sprinkle and let go of he hair.  Run your fingers through a little and top with a bit of spray if you want.  I have all-day volume, even in humid weather.  Highly recommend."
9575,1,"Great product!_Awesome product - I really love that my hair is softer and more manageable.  It has been a staple in my hair care routine.  The product is wonderful, doesn't have a heavy Argan Oil fragrance which I am very happy with and a little goes a long way with my very curly hair. Great product."
4121,0,"Substantial and Reliable Brand-Disappointing product execution_The eye shadow base doesn't work well. You can almost smell the attempted motivation and dedication towards trying to develop a good base while staying in the market of this brand's use of materials and formulations. With that being said, trying and effort doesn't matter when it comes to my face or makeup.Pro: Better than nothing and on the same playing field as many brands of shadow based with higher price.Con: the beige or sandy color doesn't blend well or mix properly with strong pigment based eye-shadow. Mac eye-shadow and wet eye shadow did not work with this.Overall, the only one that works well and is pretty much perfection: TooFaced shadow base (not the tube) the black circular pallet with the clear sparkly gel substance. It is amazing and apparently while I cant afford or feel right about spending over 19 dollars on eye shadow 'base,' it looks like it might be the only choice."
2909,0,"So disappointed!_After listening to all the hype I decided to break down and give it a try.  I have 3c, 4a corkscrew curls that are pretty well defined with a good leave in conditioner.  I have to say the curly meringue and the curl pudding have been officially placed on my waste of money list.  The cost is high, higher than justified, so that was issue number one.  Issue number two, the smell, not so great.  Issue number three, left my hair feeling dry and a little crunchy, even after putting some leave over the next few days to try and soften up the crunch and rehydrate my hair.  In the end, I was grateful I bought the stuff at Target because I returned it to the store with my receipt and got my reliable Kinky Curly leave in and curl pudding instead.  For those looking for a good alternative to Kinky Curly, go with As I Am from Sally's Beauty Supply or Darcy's Botanicals.  Both are less expensive, work excellent and have great moisture!"
4985,1,"Review for the New Smaller Falsies Mascara_Oh my gosh, if you haven't tried the new Maybelline Falsies Mascara you really need to give it a try.  It comes in a smaller holder than the old Falsies and it's much, much better.I thought the Old Falsies was 'meh'.  It didn't do much more than dye your lashes and I didn't care for it much.  The New Falsies is just awesome.  I mean I'm an older woman and I actually have to go easy because I'm sort of conservative make-up-wise and I don't want to look too made up.  This mascara really builds length for me -- with just one coat.  And I finally can actually see my lower lashes and my top lashes look like I'm wear fakes.The only downside for this product is that it's not waterproof.  It's not 'runny', but if you rub your eyes, you are going to see smudges.  Also, I should add that I have really sensitive eyes --allergies and whatnot make them itchy and watery-- and I haven't noticed any problems with this irritating my eyes.I'm really impressed.  But make sure you shop for the new smaller container.  Otherwise you are likely to get the old so-so mascara.Pam T~mom/fur mom"
8609,1,Worked on my coarse thick hair_I have very coarse thick hair that is also very dry. I am always skeptical when it comes to products that say they can do this or that for your hair.The conditioner is not as thick as those you usually get from other brands (Pantene etc) so I did use a bit more than was recommended because of the thickness of my hair and left it in for 2 minutes more as well. The result was that my hair felt soft and was very easy to detangle after using.It does have a nice fragrance that is not overpowering and although I gave it 4 stars I don't think I'll be buying this. For 1/2 the price my Pantene does just about the same job.
3845,0,"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT_I purchased NYX Cosmetics Mosaic Blush as I've always wanted to try a blush with a mixture of colors. I was so excited when I received it a day before scheduled. But after opening the box, the blush was smashed into pieces. I was so disappointed! What a rip off that was. In the future I think I will go to a drug or department store to purchase powdered cosmetics."
7962,1,great product_I did receive the product and it really works well. thanks alot i will recommend it to any one to use it
3755,1,Good_This product is wonderful for hot oil treatments. It also makes drying your hair easy and efficient. Overall it's a good product
2940,0,ehh_first off 38$ for this.. omg i swear its like nothing in the little thingy n i tought it was cream not powder &#62;:( ugh
5271,1,"pasty but good enough_I'm allergic to chemical sunscreen products - they give me red, itchy, bumpy hives and rashes that cause every pore to burn and ooze.THIS DOES NOT TRIGGER SUCH REACTION!Like most sunscreen sticks, it goes on pasty. The color if this one is white - chaulky and dry. It's probably not something you'd want to use over a very large area anyway. I don't wear make-up, so it does make me look somewhat like a vampire.Coverage seems on par with any other sunscreen I've used before. I'm not sure how water-proof it is, however. Water doesn't wash it off directly, but with a quick rub, it still doesn't stay. Then again, that seems to be a common problem with the chalky sunscreen sticks.Overall, if you have sensitive skin, I do recommend it. I didn't react to it, and I have extremely finicky skin. It doesn't smell bad. I know it says fragrance free, but I do smell a hint of something - very faint, almost like lemon."
1226,1,"My favorite!_I'm not much of a perfume person.  They are usually too floral or too potent for my liking.  Body sprays are easier for me to deal with.  But, I LOVE this perfume.  In Control is my absolute favorite perfume!  I'm not sure how to describe it, but it's not too potent or too floral for my liking.  I know that when I'm able to, I will definitely be buying more!"
4285,1,"I love it!_Awesome shampoo, I'm natural 4C type hair and this shampoo is so moisturizing and makes my hair feel so great before a deep conditioning. Doesn't feel stripping at all. I love it and the smell is beyond. This product is well recommended by YouTube naturalistas. Give it a try and I am almost certain, you will not be disappointed."
9223,1,"Luxury in a bottle-must have!_Excellent quality as I've tried many (it's on the high-end for sure) beautiful packaging,sealed well, very fresh, will re-order. This sinks into skin and hair leaving it velvety soft, love this stuff"
1832,0,"Does not work_I notice no increase in volume when using this, and it leaves a lot of build up.Considering the price, this is definitely not worth the money."
1994,1,"Like the feel of this_This product is great for your skin, stretch marks or not. The only issue I have is the aroma is less than appealing to me. Other's say they cannot smell it, so I guess it's just me. But the results are fantastic."
166,1,I love this product! It is amazing especially for scarring!_This is my favorite mask of all the different ones that I have! It works wonders for scars! I highly recommend this facial mask!!
4403,1,"Best natural facial lotion_I LOVE this facial lotion. It doesn't feel greasy at all and is the perfect texture/consistency to moisturize my very dry pregnancy skin but not too heavy or thick that I feel like there is something on my face. I am very picky when it comes to lotion as I hate the feeling of greasiness or something lingering on my skin, but this lotion gets absorbed immediately, fixing the dryness and then I forget I ever put it on. Until I can use retinol creams (for anti-aging!) again when my baby is born, this is perfect."
7082,0,"I wasn't a fan of this product to be honest_I had this product for about six months and frankly I wasn't impressed.  It didn't define my twist outs or braid outs compared to Roots of Nature coil creme, I didn't see any sheen and frankly it left my hair kind of dull and waxy feeling.  Which is odd because the ingredients looks promising.  I have type four and it is quite porous.  I passed it on to a young lady who is transitioning."
55,1,i love this color_but it is getting difficult to obtain.  my subscribe and save for this item has now been cancelled.  I get so many compliments on this color.
8901,1,"Works Well & Lasts Long_I use this on my shoulders, back, and chest during every shower to treat and prevent acne. I've been using it for around two months now. I had angry, fresh acne on my shoulders when I first began using it, and I saw improvement within a week of use. Now all of the angry acne is gone, and all that's left are the small, less noticeable red bumps that seem to stay no matter what. No new pimples have shown up in any of the places I've been using the wash, and the old stuff seems to be fading a little bit every day.What really surprised me when I first used this was the texture of the wash. It's very oily and it does not lather or soap up like most other washes. This somewhat turned me off at first, but now I am used to it and it feels nice on my skin. It also has a very neutral, quiet smell that doesn't seem to hang around after you've rinsed it off.As I said, I've been using it almost every day for two months, and I've only used a very small portion of the bottle. A half a tbsp amount is plenty for my back, shoulders, chest, and neck. I think that the bottle will last a long time, making this a very good product for the price."
3017,0,"did nothing for my hair_i am spanish and i have long, thin, curly, frizzy hair. This product did not do anything for my hair. i bought the small jar and finished it all. my hair is still frizzy and it did not even help with the tangles.I will not be buying again. i like miss jessies quick curls that product works amazing for me. i like using mane & tail conditioner. it makes my hair feel thicker and helps with the knots."
1664,1,"Miracle Product!_I recently got my hair cut by a curl expert, and she recommended this conditioner to me. It does it's job so well.My boyfriend can't keep his fingers out of my hair and my mother and sisters are all clamoring for my secret! Will buy again and again!"
5580,1,new to this_i can tell a difference but my face was really red and puffy after use and a little sore. but i think im going to do more research and use it again. i have a somewhat deep line going across my forehead (thanks dad) and im trying to make it less noticeable and this DID help i can tell with continued use it will disappear sooner or later.
1077,1,"perfect product_it takes the pimple out so dont be affraid if your pimple is bigger the first days it is just the beginning of the cure, functions on scars left by breakouts too"
666,1,"Love, love it!!!_This is great, makes your skin so lovable! It's hard, just take a tiny bit and rub it in your hands. It will melt right away. I mix it with my fave lotion and it makes my sking even better. It's great on your feet, everywhere. I don't have any dry skin problem, just love to feel and see my skin hydrated and this works. Your skin absorbs it quickly so there's no greasy residue and the smell is minimal, similar to cocoa butter."
1776,1,"Works..._This lifter helps to work the toe nail out of the skin with less pain.  You really must soak the toe in very warm water for 15-20 minutes to soften the nail and skin, in order to experience less discomfort when using this instrument."
9625,1,"Cleans well but can sting_I love Burt's Bees products, but was a little disappointed with this one. It cleaned my face well enough, but stung the sensitive areas. My nose tends to be dry and sensitive and this product irritated the skin. It does have a sweet lemony smell and lifted the make up off quickly though."
7027,1,"Nice smell_This is  a nice shampoo.a little runny,but it smells good too. I like this and would buy it again too."
6892,1,"Another Excellent Product from Cetaphil_For years I used Neutrogena branded face cleansers and always assumed that it was a quality brand despite leaving me with dry and 'tight-feeling' skin post wash and never really fully controlling pimple outbreaks.About a year ago I finally made an appointment with a dermatologist and that's where I got turned onto Cetaphil face cleansers. I've been using their regular, non-scented face wash daily in the morning and evening ever since. The results are awesome, my face is clear; no acne, or whiteheads. The formula is gentle and doesn't burn (post shave) or leave me with dry skin after.After trying Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash I'm equally impressed. This wash does have a light fragrant scent - it's not overly medical smelling or floral. Like the regular Cetaphil cleanser this product has kept my skin clear and a bit less oily than before without leaving me with the dryness that I experienced with Neutrogena products.Most definitely recommended."
1868,1,"Thick bubbles_The Rosemary Mint makes nice thick bubbles, smells crisp and herbal - a nice way to start the day.  I have found it to be non drying and a very pleasant product."
9279,1,"The flat top brush has a great feel to the handle and the bristles are dense ..._I recently tried BeautyJunkees Kabuki Brush and I have to say I am impressed. The flat top brush has a great feel to the handle and the bristles are dense but oh so soft. The bristles feel great on the skin and disperse powders nicely. I do not use foundation but it seems that the product should smooth on nicely from the look and feel of the brush fibers. Normally, I use Bobbi Brown brushes which do a great job with makeup application but this brush is a serious contender at a fraction of the price. My BB Kabuki brush was around $40 and I have used it for years so it was well worth it. This brush comes in at around a quarter of the price. Time will tell how it holds up.But certainly worth a try considering the price point and quality.The one drawback is the manufacturer recommends you wash the brush every day. Well I am sure that is best but it is not realistic for most. The packaging is simple but nice.The brush is synthetic - vegan friendly which is a consideration. Some other brushes are made of animal hair which does not appeal to everyone. All in all this brush boasts quality bristles, a nice hand grip, easy on the pocketbook price point and it works beautifully. What more could you ask more?"
3679,1,"Purchased the REAL Clarisonic and I love it._I debated on whether or not I should purchase the Clarisonic system for a long time until I finally caved and bought it (don't worry - I didn't purchase a counterfeit &#34;knock off&#34; and made sure that the serial number fit a genuine product). I'm extremely glad that I purchased it, as it has become a daily staple in my skincare routine. I use it on a daily basis (sometimes morning & night) with a gentle cleanser and it works extremely well. It definitely cleans my face better than a wash towel and gets deep in the pores to remove oils and dirt. This product is entirely waterproof - I love how it could be taken into the shower and/or bathtub. The only things I really don't like about the Mia is that it takes FOREVER to achieve a full charge and it dries out the skin a bit. Other than that, it's a great product."
8286,1,"Awesome product_I have curly hair that tends to frizz in the humidity and needed a shampoo to combat that. Unfortunately, I have very sensitive skin, so I have to be careful with what shampoo I buy. However, Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion is gentle to my scalp and works wonderfully to calm down my frizz. Plus, being a Suave product it is not expensive, so another great incentive to buy it. I really think this a great shampoo."
8745,0,"Poor packaging._I typically love this product. However, when I received this stick, the product had metled and re-hardend; rendering it impossible to use. The product just flakes out of the tube."
1270,1,"Nothing Better!_I started using the Batiste brand quite a few years ago.  I have used every dry shampoo out there, from the most expensive to the least expensive.  This is hands-down the best!  I love all of them, doesn't matter which 'smell', they're all good. (did not like the one with color).  I hope they never discontinue this."
3014,1,Great for brows_Not much to say but this is great for keeping brows in place! Great price point too -- not a product you need anything fancy for and this fits the bill.
8052,1,"Does the Job_This Pantene AgeDefy shampoo says it will fight  7 things: 'Breakage, Split Ends, Frizz, Unruly Grays, Lackluster Color, Thin Look, and Dryness.' Being as old as the hills, and having masses of unruly, frizzy, crazy gray hair, I figured I'd be a good test subject for this shampoo. The result after one wash  is quite good, though voluminous. My hair is soft and shinny, with less frizz, but simply a ton of curls. I look like an aged '80s Big Hair rocker. I mean Really Big Hair.The aroma is very pleasant, and the feel of the shampoo is lusciously creamy. The only thing I don't like, but I expected from a mass production brand like Pantene, is it is a chemical concoction with a lot of things I can't pronounce. Words like Guar Hydroxypropylyrimonium Chloride (acts as a conditioner). It also has Blue 1, Yellow 5, and Red 33. So as much as I like my '80s rocker curls, this isn't a shampoo I'll be using on a regular basis. If you don't mind a lot of chemicals, and have one or more of the 7 problem areas listed above (especially 'Thin Look'!), this Pantene AgeDefy shampoo will do the job."
7369,1,"Great for Gel Eyeliner_Although it took a bit of practice and getting used to, I have perfected my eyeliner using this brush. It's not too thin or too thick and I've never had any shedding or hairs straying off and sticking out of it after multiple cleanings.I can finally do my cat-eye quickly thanks to an awesome gel liner (the one by Clinique is the best and doesn't dry out!) and this great, affordable little brush. Well done again Real Techniques!"
786,1,"Does a Pretty Good Job_I think that Mychelle has some decent cleansers and this is definitely one of them. It works pretty well for a gel cleanser and does not overly-dry the skin. My skin is combination and this does a nice job of clearing the oil in my t-zone without completely stripping the rest of my face. A little goes a long way, so I just bought the small one. I've been using it for three months and I've hardly put a dent in it. For the price you can't beat it  (although now that I've tried REN's Mayblossom cleanser [which is AMAZING for combination skin!] I might just splurge and cough up more to have that instead)."
5632,1,Nice neutral color_I like this color a lot but it does make your tips look a little yellow. After about 5 days I got tired of the yellow looking color and stamped over it with my Konad and added black french tips.
1354,1,Best way to start your tan !_I absolutely HATE self-tanners but this product is AMAZING !! It is a wonderful moisturizer that gradually gives your skin a slow tan.  Absolutely no streaking and the color is perfect. NO orange at all. I will be using this product all summer. YAY
8559,1,Wow_This is my first time using mango butter for hair and add it to my lotion to give it the extra moisture that your skin will be looking for.I recommend it.
3180,1,"Amazing!_This is magical on my curly hair. My hair has always been a tad frizzy and after working this through my hair,  I can finally see all of my curls frizz free. Plus: a little goes a long way; you can't beat the price either! My wash-and-gos haven't looked better! .-_-"
2415,1,Love the Smell of This Liquid Soap...._The fragrance is too strong and smells quite delightful in fact. The soap lathers up nicely and cleans hands without over drying them!Great price for this product too through Amazon.
4075,1,"Very Nice Well Made And Looks So Nice In My Shop!_very well made, love it! I did order more, do wish the cost wasn't so much.Tracie Bobb, Philadelphia, Pa."
9679,1,"Decreases fine lines_My mother noticed that her skin looked brighter and there was a decrease in fine lines on her face. This product is very easy to apply. It comes with a dropper and you can control how much you put on your face, although not much is needed at all. This serum dries quickly but doesn't leave a greasy residue. My mother also noted that it didn't feel 'heavy' on her face after it was applied. She liked the pleasant citrus smell.Disclosure: I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
5878,1,Works for thick african-american natural hair_I bought this for my daughter to use on her african-american thick curly coarse hair. She swears by this stuff so I have purchased about four bottles for her since they are only 4oz.
5060,1,Love it!_It matches my leopard print luggage! It fits all of my make up brushes in it! I love it! Will buy another one!
9506,1,Love the Suave Kids_I love all of the Suave Kids products.1. They are mostly tear free.2. They are combination products meaning we don't have to have separate shampoos and conditioners- and sometimes body wash.3. They are less expensive than many other hair care products even though they are just as good or better.I really liked this new Peach scent and my girls did also.
5259,1,Seems to be working_I have only taken these for about a week but I can say they do curve my food cravings. So far I have lost about 2 pounds and will continue to use. I am happy will the results so far.
6856,0,Disappointed_I used this on dry hair in hopes that it would add and keep moisture and luster to both my son's natural hair and my relaxed air. It didn't help either hair type. Both of our hair was left just as dry and as if there was nothing on it. Ths was an expensive waste for me.
2329,1,HOLDS GREAT_Smells wonderful and holds my thick hair.  And the price can't be beat.  I will buy this again and again.
8809,1,crack for the skin!_I am hooked. I love this stuff. If you are a makeup user like me then you know how important it is to have the right powder. This is perfect and I use a smaller brush under my eyes over concealer and it makes it look so natural. It immediately takes away shine Can't recommend it enough.
9294,1,Best mascara ever_This mascara is amazing I've tried several different mascaras from drug store to high end and nothing compares this gives me the most volume as well as length & doesn't flake of at all. I would suggest getting a very good eye makeup remover however because this stuff can be tricky to get off.
5438,1,"Reasonably priced natural tanning product_There are many self-tanning products, but, this one is one of the nicest, for any price, that I have used, so, I'm thrilled that something, so reasonably priced, is this effective. First of all, it is by NIVEA, so, it's first and foremost, a fantastic moisturizer. It leaves the skin as soft and well-conditioned as the best moisturizers out there.As a tanner, it's amazing. It is a gradual process, and it doesn't leave that horrible orange-y look, but, a subtle, but, noticeably golden color and almost a glow. I have gotten so many compliments on how nice I look tan, that I would buy this if it was double the low price.I don't like to lay out in the sun to get a tan, but, i live in Florida, where if you're very pale, people think you're sick. This product is a godsend, and I love it. I would very highly recommend this great product. Why pay three to four times more when there is a product that is this nice, that leaves your skin soft, golden-colored, and without any unpleasant streaks, smell or weird color?"
358,1,"for both men and women_I enjoy the fragrance of 'CK One,' and am female.  It was a little difficult to find in stores, since they don't really know where to stock it (Mens, or Women's fragrances?) I bought mine at a 'big box' store (found it in mens area) and paid around $25 for 1.7 oz (50 ml.)"
8807,1,"These are so cute_I ordered these bows and they are so cute! They send you 10 of each design and they are the perfect size for real nails or fake nails. I will be ordering me more of these in the future. I love the designs, you get cheetah in different colors, zebra in different colors, and you get different patterns in black. Love love love them!"
9815,1,Really good for bags_I gave this to my friend who has really bad bags under her eyes and she loved it and it even took some of the darkness out to
7430,1,"Excellent for Dry Hair_I have very dry brittle hair and this product is the best one I've found to moisturize my hair without leaving it heavy andgreasy feeling.  It has a pleasant smell and easy to apply and my hair doesn't feel heavy afterwards.  Most moisturizing products make my hair feels like it needs washing, this doesn't.  It seems to be helping my hair become less brittle and dry after 2 weeks use."
3415,1,"Good cleanser, but strong perfume smell_This is a very gentle yet effective cleanser. Perfect for my combination skin. The only complaint I have is the strong smell. It smells like a drug store shampoo. I'll finish using this bottle, but probably won't buy again."
7294,1,Smells great_This shampoo smells great and my scalp feels amazing. My hair feels clean but not overly dry. Also it smells awesome.
1907,1,"Pillowy Cloud of Wonderful Goodness :0)_This scent is a pillowy, sweet, fragrant cloud of sweet, sugary goodness that will leave your heart light and without a care in the world.  You will be teleported to a time once spent only dreaming of what you will become and when your next meal will be served.  Santa Claus would be scented like this.  It is the scent dreams travel upon.  Billowy and light, yet lasts for hours.  Opens with fresh berries and vanilla and then on into sugared powdered candy fluff - sweet but not too sweet...there is mention of musk but only a whisper.  Normally I am bothered by musk but not in this case - I don't even notice it.  I You will find yourself respraying if only to gaze upon the  tender pink elixir that will spritz upon your skin pure love.  Ok, I realize I am not probably making any sense but I really enjoy this cologne and I do hope they plan on keeping it a part of the line.  I am a forty-something female and this scent refreshes me in a 'I'm still a little girl at heart' way ...without screaming TODDLER.  Please give it a try.  You might surprise yourself!  If you do not care for it...send it to me!  It is an inexpensive adventure either way!  ENJOY!  P.S.  if you find yourself wanting to love Pink Sugar but something about it puts you off - the musk perhaps...burnt note maybe?  Give this a try....perfection!"
8591,1,"The Best Disposable Razors You'll Ever Use_I am always a little hesitant when it comes to disposable razors. My skin is very sensitive, and I often get little red bumps on my thighs after I shave, or I end up cutting myself around my knee or ankle. Those little nicks are painful, and the only way it seems to avoid them is to invest in a good quality razor. Those, unfortunately, do not come cheap.Since Shick is one of the leading brands for women's razors, I decided to take a chance on their new disposable razors. It's not just the blades that are disposable; you can also discard the body of the razor as well. If you've stuck with the same razor for some time, you know that after time build-up appears on the handle of the razor and it looks kind of scummy hanging out in your shower cartridge. I think this is a great alternative for someone who doesn't want to put in the effort of cleaning a razor body, but wants a smooth and effective shave.The Hydro Silk Disposables comes with a money back guarantee: if this is not the best disposable shave for your skin, they'll refund you. I've tried a handful of disposable razors, and this one is by far my favorite. The handle of the razor has slip proof rubber that contours to your hand for a better grip; it won't slip. It's not as high quality as some of the permanent razors you might own from this brand or its competitors, but it is most certainly the top of the line for disposables.The razor head contains five blades that will love your curves. They glide so smoothly along your skin that you won't believe the hair has been removed until you run your fingertips across it and feel the results for yourself.You get three disposable razors in this set, each with their own protective guard for the blades so they won't rust or dull when covered in your shower. Each blade also has what Shick calls a 'water activated moisturizing serum', which does indeed contribute to softer, smoother skin. After my first shave with the Shick disposable razors, I noticed I had none of the little red bumps that normally occur with shaving--even when using a sensitive skin shaving cream.The Shick Hydro Silk Disposables have completely changed my opinion of disposable razors. If you have sensitive skin or even if you just want a close and smooth shave, invest in these razors and feel the difference."
9753,1,"I have noticed a difference_I have noticed a more even skin tone throughout my face, after using this for 3 weeks.  It didn't happen over night.  I started noticing it after about 2 weeks.  My skin looks brighter, and not as dull.  I am 40 years old, and my skin has become more dull in the last several years.  It just looks tired.  This cream does make a subtle difference in my skin.The consistency of this cream is light with a medium scent that dissipates fairly quickly.  A little goes a long way, and it spreads really easily.  It isn't greasy, and it soaks in quickly.  It leaves my skin feeling smooth.I'm going to give it 8 weeks, as suggested, before I decide if it will join my facial regimen permanently."
1096,1,"Great smell_Great smell, strong but very feminine, gives me confidence. It is not fake, smells and lasts exactly the same as bought from the store  for the double as much."
4398,1,Nice!!!_I was nervous to buy this because of reports it smells. I don't find it smells bad. it doesn't have that sweetness like other products but its great. Oils scalp nicely. I really like it.
4460,1,"Fine hair_My hair is fine and thin and a little past my shoulders-it gets tangled instantly even if a puff of wind blows into it so I got this stuff hoping it would help me comb through it after showers and not leave it greasy or heavy during the day. Check on both accounts. I only had to use the tiniest pea sized amount, rub it in my hands and then kind of comb it through my hair with my fingers. It worked very well!! Definately recommend and will buy again."
9717,1,"Nice clean scent - easy on skin_The Aqua Sparkle scent of the Caress Body Wash line has an eye-opening clean scent. It reminds me a bit of Coast soap mixed with a floral scent. It seems a bit strong when using, but after the shower, it leaves a soft lingering scent. The body wash itself is easy on the skin and doesn't dry it out, leaving it soft and luxurious feeling. The bottle is a nice size, easy to handle, but the top doesn't always open easily, especially with wet hands.This one's a keeper in our home!"
1822,1,best  ever_Love them. Own two plan on getting all. Blends into shadow perfectly. I use them all the time. Cute packaging also.
2860,1,Five Stars_It's a very different color I like it.
178,1,"Great product_I have eczema and use the &#34;free products&#34; mostly. The dermatologist recommended I use the Aveeno body wash, which does the trick for those stinky places, sparingly. I've had no problems."
1694,1,The best_Hands down this is the best hair mask/ conditioner for dry hair. Worth every cent.
9353,1,"Great Vitamin C Serum_I have a really awesome Vitamin C Serum to share with you today from Amara Organics. You will love this serum because it really does work and it's not as expensive as some of the other name brands that I have tried in the past. So, it's a good cost effective serum that you can feel good about.If you have some environmental skin damage, then this serum can help without you going thru those costly and painful procedures at the dermatologist's office. I used to go every few years to have some of the minor ones, never did the lasers, but those others still were quite painful. I decided to stop and just seek out the best skincare and just let nature do it's thing. I am so glad I did because it's really not worth all the stuff you go thru plus the cost when you can get some of the same results with good quality skincare products."
8824,1,GORGEOUS polishes!_These nail polishes are awesome! I have over 200 bottles in my collection but these are my FAVORITE! They also got here very quickly and were carefully packed! Love them!
7188,0,"Sally Hansen polish strips_I have been a fan of these saloon effect strips since they were introduced in 2011 and I have used many of them. But this particular set, although very nice, was completely dried out. The strips did not separate from the protective slide at all and I had to peel them using tweezers. Then I applied the strips i managed to save on my nails using base and top coat to stick them on. The result looks nice, but I gave me a very hard time trying not to destroy the dried strips, canceling the easy application idea of this product."
1921,1,"Leaves here shiny and silky_My hair is color treated and as I've aged it has gotten more coarse. My hair is also long as I'm growing it out for Locks of Love (children's wig making organization). Saw this product and thought I'd try it! My major complaint is the way it feels when it goes on...basically it doesn't really feel like it is doing anything as my hair feels as though it is rather gummy and thin feeling. So the first time I used it I must say I didn't have much hope that it was working. Wow, was I wrong. Usually no matter what conditioner I use except for the tubes that come with the hair dye, I have to carefully detangle my hair. With Motions I was able to run the brush right through my hair. Upon drying my hair was very soft and silky. The conditioner coats the hair really well and my hair felt and looked fuller with the product's use. Definitely recommend!"
4195,1,"Goldilocks says this is 'Juuuuuuusssttt RIGHT!'  Not too stiff, not too flimsy!_I have bought more than one of these, 2 for me (1 for each bathroom), and more for gifts, all well received.  Mild bristled brush perfect for light exfoliation and just generalized body cleansing more effective than a washcloth.  One step up would be the Kingsley Sisal Body Brush ($7.99 Amazon.com for Prime members free shipping).  One step down would be a rough washcloth."
4648,1,"Mom loves it_My mom was buying sunscreen from the dermatologist. However, theirs is quite expensive, so she asked me to find an alternative. This is so reasonable, is good protection, doesn't smell like sunscreen, and has a great texture/feel. I will be buying more!"
2512,1,"Best box color I've found_I have dirty ash blonde hair. I hate how dull it looks so I lighten it. I've used lots of box dyes and none were perfect, I always had to use toner or purple shampoo to make it a nice cool/ash color.I was so happy to find that this shade is a one stop shop! It comes out perfect the first time. a perfect natural looking cool blonde. It smells better than most too which is a plus. I do leave it on for a little bit longer than called for. It usually says 25 mins and I might do it for 35 or so.A couple of notes though: I highlight my hair too, so sometimes my highlights turn out a little blue but a couple washes later with some clarifying shampoo and my hair looks PERFECT!Also: if your hair is longer than about shoulder length, you should probably buy two boxes. Yeah, its more expensive but its waaay cheaper than the salon.Happy dying!!!  :)"
132,1,"Fantastic Coverage & Protection_This is the best foundation I have ever used.  It is easy to apply, completely covers and evens the skin tone, and stays on all day without clumping up.  Like the other reviewers, I appreciate that it dries matte.  I tried it because I have lupus and live at a high altitude, so I need extra UV protection.  So far so good.  The ability to lighten and darken the tone is great, although I do wish there were a way to add cooler/pink tones, since it is a tad yellowish.  That being said, I get lots of compliments about my skin when I wear this and, hey, I feel pretty!"
425,1,"Helpful for PUPPs_If you have PUPPs, I am so sorry. I've been there. So bad that when my husband was putting steroid cream on me, I turned around and he was actually crying. My midwife at one checkup called the doctor and didn't realize she left the door open a crack and I heard her say, 'I've never seen it this bad! Ever!' So yeah. Bad. And it can last for a few weeks after you deliver (mine did) which I didn't know until my doula told me -- so in the end I'm glad I didn't get induced early, but I certainly considered it. A lot. The oral steroids which I held off until week 38 (I wasn't sleeping much by then so there was not much choice) did help a ton, but before then this soap helped (although it was terribly drying so use a very rich bath oil and cream afterwards). And to sleep a few hours I actually would take a hot bath scrubbing with a brush and this soap -- which would make the itch worse (the theory is, when that much histamine is released all at once, your body then fights it for a few hours at least) and that is how I was able to sleep. But I don't recommend it unless you're about to lose your tentative grip on reality. The steroid cream really did nothing (but make my husband cry lol). The oral steroids were amazing and I'm glad I waited so long because my DD has no ill effects. I also have NO scarring despite my itching in my sleep wherever I could reach. So it will not last and you will barely remember it a year or more down the road. And even though mine lingered in a few areas after delivery, it was nowhere near as bad as week 35-38! Hang in there, Momma! Try this. And try to remember, it does get better!"
5464,1,"Good rollers!_These rollers were pretty good, but they are a little flimsy. I find when I am putting them in at least 2-3 come apart and I have to redo that section. Then when I wake up in the morning after setting them right before bed the night before, at least 2-3 have fallen out, and I wear a beanie to try and prevent that. In fairness, I move around a good amount.Other than that, these rollers are great. I have very fine hair, and don't like to use heat to curl it as it is easily damaged. I'm rocking curls for the first time ever because I've finally got a good way to get nice heat-less curls."
5135,1,Very happy_I ordered this and it was back ordered but customer service was great and in contact with me. I got my product super fast once it was back in stock.i just finished using this for the first time and I have to say it smells nice it's a tropic scent. I have had it on for about twenty minutes and there is no self tanner smell. I am not orange or streaky. I am tanner then I was and I am very white but I am not dark. I will apply it again tomorrow night and build the color. When you spray it it does splatter so lean over a towel. Overall I am happy  and love the mitt I just wish it was double sided.
8685,1,"The best eye makeup remover I've tried!_I love these Simple Eye Makeup Remover Pads! Not only do they remove even waterproof mascara and eyeliner well, but they also don't make my eyes burn--a problem I've had with most of the remover pads I've tried in the past. I also love how big they are--one pad can easily remove the makeup from both eyes."
9395,1,"Thumbs wayyy up!_This stuff works WONDERS! Like, holy moly, fountain of youth serum here! Within days I noticed that my skin looked tighter. Lines diminishing. I wanted to scream from the hills about this stuff!! It's been clinically tested and proven to stimulate collagen and reverse the effects of aging. It's all pure natural organic ingredients (WOOHOO!) It's packed with antioxidants too. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff!!! Go buy it up ladies!!!"
6410,1,"I love Sigma brushes._I got the premium kit but it didn't have my favorite style foundation brush, so I bought this one to complete the set."
3196,1,"Heavenly scent! I want to eat this stuff :)_I was literally standing in the drug store smelling this stuff like a mental patient! This scent is amazing! It's like a yummy brown sugary/vanilla scent.If anyone from Caress is reading...PLEASE make this scent into a lotion, body spray, hair spray, room spray, dog spray... I want to smell this ALL DAY LONG.The only downside is that the scent disappears very quickly!Oh yeah, it's moisturizing too. Don't have to lotion up after my showers. Although I WOULD if they made this scent into a lotion.Just sayin' :)"
73,1,"Tried and True_This is the best bang for your buck when it comes to inexpensive mascaras. It definitely gives lashes dramatic volume but in a way that draws attention to your eyes and not your makeup. It doesn't clump at all, and it only flakes if you really start rubbing your eyes. My only complaint with this product is that it is very difficult to remove...but it's a waterproof mascara. It's supposed to be long lasting! When I shower and wash my face each night it will not budge. It doesn't bother me, but if you are someone who must remove every speck before bedtime, this is not for you!"
6551,1,"Great for primers and concealers_This precision brush is perfect for around the eyes or blending out concealer! I like to use this with paint pots, eye primers, concealer under eyes and spot concealing blemishes. This is defiantly a multi tasking brush."
7972,1,"Skin care_I've been using Mary Kay for years and have been using some of this particular timewise line, because I was finishing off my other timewise products so now that I'm using the whole line I am very happy with the results. My favorite is the cleanser, it feels so luxurious. It took some getting use to the gritty feeling from the night cream, but hey with the results your suppose to get with this I'll make myself get use to it. Lol. Oh and I saved $50.00-60.00 by purchasing on amazon."
5725,1,"Works_Don't be afraid of this product being greasy and sitting on your skin. It absorbs, and any serum is worth the extra price; with regular use."
7162,1,Smooth and Silky_I'm impressed with how smooth and silky this product is.  The color blends in well with my pretty normal color complexion.  I'll have to wait a couple months before I can judge how well it works as a sunblock since I live in northern Minnesota and it's only March right now!
320,1,"Lovely scent_Don't know yet if this product is actually helping my skin in any way but after I have thoroughly washed my face and rinsed off with cold water I put some of this on with a cotton ball and let it dry before putting on primer (if it's morning and I'm going to wear makeup) or before putting on my night cream.  What I like best about it is its scent though, I don't know that it's actually making any difference in the overall quality of my skin."
2023,1,"A Classic Bath Staple_I've tried many bath products in my life.  No matter what, Rainbath will always be my favorite little luxury.  I suffer from both allergies and extremely sensitive skin that tends to be a bit dry.  Rainbath contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (unfortunately), so it isn't organic,  but otherwise it is kind to my skin and doesn't give me a migraine with heavy perfumes.I would describe Rainbath as a unisex product.  Some women complain that it is too masculine, but I'm the type of girl who loves oriental and woodsy scents.  Rainbath is golden-brown in color, with the light consistency of gel.  It has the most gorgeous herbal scent.  It makes me think about being in the Maine woods, with the scent of trees and rain.  It is just very natural and earthy.  I feel like a sexy hippie when I shower...meow!Rainbath is simply lovely.  It can also double as a facial cleanser, too."
1,1,excellent_Good product. Use a little bit on your spot and the next day its already shedding the first layer of skin. By the 3 rd day the spot is almost gone. Cant get these results from the most expensive products
5449,1,"Yummy scent_Love this stuff. It's basically just coconut oil with a bit of vitamin e oil, vanilla fragrance and a tiare flower in the bottom. The smell is AMAZING. It smells like baked goods, and lingers for around 12 hours (not strong or overpowering even on initial application, just yummy). It is very moisturizing, can seem greasy if you overapply, and sinks in quickly. I prefer it to 'regular' extra virgin coconut oil because it seems to go on smoother for some reason. The packaging is meh - when you first get it, it has this inner lid thing that has to be removed- it's hard to remove/not get stuck inside the bottle. It has a screw top lid and I really wish it had a flip top lid instead. I've almost tipped and spilled the whole thing mid application many times so packaging leaves something to be desired. But the product inside is amazing. A bit spendy compared to 'regular' coconut oil, but worth it."
2153,1,Nice Sunscreen for Adults and Kids_This sunscreen goes on dry as described.  We use it on the entire family and are happy with the protection.
5119,1,"Does A Good Job In A Pinch_I've been buying this product for a couple of years now. Since I go to the nail salon no more than twice a month and am no manicurist, this is used when I am in maintenance mode. I don't know about other people's cuticles, but mine grow like crazy and are thick and hard. It'd be nice if I used cuticle cream at night before I went to bed, but I more often than not don't and that is when this product really cones in handy.The trick is to apply this to the cuticles and underneath the nail pad. Let it sit for about a minute and then use an orange stick to push down the cuticle and clean built up skin and debris under the nail type. Wash your hand immediately with warm water and soap, rinse and dry, and then repeat the process on the other hand.This stuff dissolves the cuticle and leaves the nails looking clean. I file my nails when I am through and buff out any ridges and then apply a couple of coats of OPI nail gloss. If you do this once a week, it will maintain your nails between visits to the nail salon.I use these on my toe nails as well. Works fine. My only advice is to watch the clock and never exceed the recommended time the manufacturer provides."
5623,1,"I'm Hooked..._Not impressed... The first few days of using it, I was not impressed, but continued using it anyway.  After about a week it seemed to transform my face.  Wrinkles seemed much less noticable.  Overall color improved.  Compliments came from many people. I'm hooked."
5847,1,Worked better than Wen_I wanted to try Wen for years but did not want to spend that much money.  I found this at Ross around 10/2011 for $5.00 and have used it until 10/2012.  The first time I washed my hair with this it was amazing the difference. I have very dry red hair and this made my hair shiny and bouncy. Even more amazing was how fast my hair grew in a year (pixie cut to touching my shoulders) and this when I am 49 years old and spent five months on 500 - 1000 calorie diet. I wanted to try Wen so I ordered it about a year later and my hair did appear a little shiner but after about three weeks of use my hair started falling out in hand fulls.  Stopped Wen and now back to this cheaper version.
8291,1,Awesome!_I've been using Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Shampoo for a month now and the change in my hair has been remarkable. I have corse think hair that I straighten daily. After using this shampoo for a few weeks my hair maintained shine consistently. I know longer have frizz or fly aways! I would recommend this to anyone with complex hair.
5057,1,Great Product because..._This is a great product because it smells absolutely wonderful.  I use it when I want to air dry my hair for a natural curl usually for the first 2 months after a fresh perm.  It leaves my hair smelling so great!  I use a lot of heat on my hair otherwise so I use this product after a shampoo to protect.  I have to add a shine serum when blow drying because this product isn't going to add any kind of shine to my hair.  Sometimes I use just a tiny amount (and I do mean tiny) on dry hair to freshen up the smell of my hair and protect against the humidity.  My hair gets really frizzy when its humid but not when I have Cantu in it.  It's perfect for me!
8426,1,My hair feels great after a shower_It must be since it contains methanol and caffeine that my hair feels wonder after each and every use. !
5321,1,Will buy this again_I have dry combo skin. I like this mask it helps calm breakouts. Does not dry skin out. Leaves it hydrated and feels tingly.
9426,0,"Uh, No._I don't know where all these glowing reviews are coming from, but this product is a pain.I used it, and it stains your skin. You have to be very careful not to get in on your scalp. After just a few moments in my hands (from bottle to hair) I looked like I had been murdering chickens. And my hands looked like Lady MacBeth's nightmare. It did put a little glow to my hair...but it wasn't worth the trouble.I'd just look elsewhere, but I seem to be in the minority."
7934,1,"Heats up fast! Very professional looking!_This is my first good quality flat iron that i have ever purchased. I mistakenly bought 2! But i guess i'll keep it or give it to a friend. Anyways it arrived on time works very well. It has a digital display lowest setting is 300 highest is 450. The color is a beautiful baby blue,swivel cord comes in handy preventing the cord from getting all tangly. So you can move around with this do curls etc. Very long cord. The plates are really nice and makes my hair smooth and straight. I didnt have to wait long for it to heat up either. No heat damage was done to my hair at all. I would definitely recommend this item to a friend"
2812,1,"Nivea creme.......the ahhhhhhh for skin_I  live at altitude where moisture does not stay with us long.  This creme keeps my skin (not face--body) soft and supple without making me feel like I am drowning in oils that come off on everything. Without this creme, my hands look like a logger's hands--chapped and DRY!  I even use this sometimes on my lips in the winter...better than waxy sticks...and lasts!In the winter it is great to keep off the wind burn too.I like being able to buy this product in 4 packs and save some money."
5650,1,ALWAYS WANTED THESE_I have been seeking out for these nail dotting pens for quite some time and when I spot them here on amazon I made sure to grab them at this steal of a deal. I started doing my own nail to save myself the extra money and began to build my very own 'at home nail salon'. These dotting tool are a must have is nail art. The items are exactly as advertised and will fit in well as a addition to any first 'do it yourselvers' out there. Good product and shipping. Thank you.
9262,1,Very gentle and simple to use_I have very VERY sensitive skin so was hesitant to order this. I'm glad I went ahead and ordered. Follow the directions and pre-wet the sponge. Then it is very gentle to use and leaves your face so clean and smooth.
1992,1,"Nice Deep Conditioning_I have thick but fine hair, easily tangled and color treated. I got this hoping to just keep my hair from drying out too much after getting highlights. Well, the directions suggest you cover your hair with a plastic cap and put under a dryer for 5-10 minutes.  Of course, I didn't go to all that trouble - I'm not a professional stylist. I just used it as regular conditioner and left it on for a bit. It took a while to wash out, and it felt a bit greasy. But my hair was then MUCH easier to comb out.  And after drying, my hair felt nice and soft. Unfortunately, the feeling doesn't last after that one use. So, continual use is recommended. But it's a nice large jar, especially for the price."
4616,1,"Shellac Polish_I used have used this polish base now for almost a year with no problems. I am allergic to the base that is used with them. Very easy to use, and does the job its intended to do...prepare you nails for the polish....."
8269,1,"My husband gave it a thumbs up!_I got this for my husband, who swears by Cetaphil. Cetaphil is a great product, but it offers zero protection from the sun. My husband shaves his head all the time, so it's really important to use something that actually helps with all the dangerous rays out there, not to mention preventing unnattractive spots in the future! So according to my husband, he liked this Dove lotion. It's not a moisturizer per se, but it's a great alternative. Because the spf is only 15, it goes on smoothly, without feeling too thick or greasy. It doesn't smell like anything really, which we both like, because I can't stand really strong lotions/perfumes and and he is a guy and doesn't need anything smelly that stands out so much. The price is great, though it isn't a very big bottle. I like that more and more men's products like this are being released because I think it's nice when guys make an attempt to look after themselves. He doesn't  use it on his head every day, but when he does(after shaving) he says it doesn't burn him even if he nicks himself, so that's always a plus. It's not a miracle product or anything, but he seems to like it so that's good enough for me!"
576,0,No Thanks_Sticky residue; it's really not good for wood.Try the Seventh Generation Wood Cleaner - 10x better and it smells nice too.
4363,1,"i love ivory shea butter_this is my second order from this seller and i have become hooked on shea butter. i use it for everything from hair to skin (WHOLE FAMILY). orignally ordered it for my teenage son's eczema, his is very bad. started researching natural remedies, 20 years ago i never heard of eczema now everyone seems to have it (something in the environment and foods i think)  i also add coconut, Jamaican castor, emu, and jojoba oils to my butter to reap all the benefits. the only issue i have like others is the packaging. i think it could be better. it was wrapped in plastic and with these summer mths ahead im a little wary on how it will be delivered in extreme heat.thats the reason i gave 4 instead of 5 stars otherwise great product, quick ship, great price. will definitely be ordering in the future, definitely recommend to others to use. rite now i store my unmixed portion in my fridge til im ready to mix another batch. i hope thats ok i dont want to lose any of its natural benefits."
3943,1,"Very pretty colors_There is such a wide range of colors, you can find a color to go with anything, it is a really nice set."
7337,1,Line 'Em Up_I dig them. Got two mahogany unfortunately. Wouldn't recommend for the chocolate skinned goddesses out there though. I've pale lips and they *just* show on mine. Smooth consistency though.
430,1,"Great price and a really nice oil._Super oil, super value. I use this all over after a shower and have even added some to my facial cleansing oil. It is good and runny, no smell and a little goes a long way."
1818,0,"ugggghhhhh they changed the formula_mannnnn I hate that they changed the formula, I can tell because when I go to put on my eyebrow pencil my eyebrows feel too slick, Where as before I could literally draw them on, now I don't know what to do."
9889,0,"Hmmm :-/_I received this product free of charge as part of SalonGuys' Market Research Program and sincerely do state that it's the most disappointing product I've received thus far. My review on this product is being written in the most unbiased form possible, and to be fair I had my father try the brush on his hair in order for us to compare and contrast our experiences.What I found disappointing is the actual assembly of the brush itself - I feel that it was made from cheap materials and although you do get a nice grip from its considerate ergonomic design (which they did construct nicely!), that's as much grip as you get! I have naturally curly hair that is only evidently curly when wet, since I always dry it straight, and noticed that it managed my hair better when straight (and already dry and detangled) than when wet (when knots tend to occur during the washing process, especially after shampooing).The bristles are weak and a bit too flimsy for my liking, but when my father tried it on his dry hair, he loved it. My father has a full set of medium coarse hair (with a standard short haircut) and he is constantly brushing it, a detail which allows him to be a fair judge on this brush's performance. I ended up giving him the brush (much to his delight, despite maybe the bright pink color not being his favorite thing :-) and I continue using my standard and very generic detangler brush that my mother gave me many years ago (those which you find at 99 cents stores).In conclusion, I do not recommend this brush, but am grateful that my father has a new brush he loves!"
8733,1,"Prettier than photo shows!_~This clip is MUCH PRETTIER than the photo shows!But it is very heavy because of the size & materials used to craft it...So unless you have a lot of hair it will not work as a hair clipThankfully hair is one thing I have a lot of but even if I didn't I'd still enjoy this beautiful clip for clipping on my dark peacoat as a pendant & on the outside of my black boots.Again, THE PHOTO DOESN'T DO IT JUSTICE!"
525,1,great foundation_I've tried alot of mineral/powder foundations and this is the only one that doesn't cake on my face. I am 52 but still have oily skin so I need a foundation the doesn't settle into the creases. This one is the best.
2334,1,"Great Semi Permanent Dye!_Pretty red shade. Not to intense, more like a tint if you have dark brown hair. It washes out with each wash and didn't damage my hair. Would buy again. Great shade!"
3281,1,"For The 'Mature' as Well_Ok, I am far removed from being a teen with whom acne is usually associated. Not to say that I am old enough to have been around when Hippocrates first extracted bitter powder from Willow bark for his version off salicyclic acid. But acne is still a reality for those of us whose teen years are far behind us. A 2% salicylic acid solution is a fairly common ingredient in acne treatment and Clearasil is no exception. The advantage of Clearasil in my view is that it does not have an overpowering harsh odor and it does not irritate my skin. It performs its primary purpose of acne control as well. There are numerous similiar products available and ones personal preferences for odor and other characteristics will dictate the brand of choice. For my purposes the usage of Clearsil meets my requirements and I recommend its use."
1562,1,"Saves me from 'bad hair' days!_I have 3b curls that look more like 3c in high humidity, mostly corkscrews with some botticelli waves too.  My hair is fine, but there is lots of it.  Past my shoulders.I really love this product.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because, unlike most other reviewers, I find the smell to be too strong.  Granted, I have lots of allergies so my nose is probably more sensitive.  But I deal with the scent as this works so well.I use this product 2 different ways:1. On dry hair, this will fix a bad hair day (frizz, stringiness, some curls fell straight, etc.).  Sometimes I spray in my hands then smooth over the offending sections of hair, give it a little scrunch, and it will dry in 30 minutes or so into shiny curls, like magic!2. On wet hair, after leaving most of my One Condition in, I will scrunch out some water, then spray my hair thoroughly with Set It Free (maybe 12 pumps).  This was my routine when I lived in humid Florida and I actually had shiny, bouncy curls that would last at least 2 days with some slight refreshing with the spray.  Only thing I don't like about this routine is that your hair stays wet for a long time (I don't diffuse) and it is expensive.So my routine with it now is to fix bad hair days on dry hair.  It's just more affordable and I live in a colder climate now and don't want my hair wet all day.  Angell and B'Curls didn't work for me but I Love SIF."
7796,1,Its Thin but the cuality is good_I got this and I thought it was going to be Thicker but it really is very Thin and I have lots of hair so maybe with 4 packages of this would do. The hair looks nice and Sleek. Chinese Type.
8084,1,"Lasting scent._It smells fruity, but in a fun and non-cheap way.I think the target demographic for this scent is about teenage to mid 20s, I am in my 30s and I cannot resist it. I love the smell. At first it is a bit too strong, but the scent stays even if I washed my hand with water.I used a tester so I am not sure if the tester perfume was a lot stronger than the regular perfume. Still, the price is super unbeatable. I can daresay this is one of the BEST celebrity fragrances. I bought lady gaga's fame as well but I got bored of it quick."
2514,1,"ATTENTION MOMS: Help your teen prevent pock-marks!_ATTENTION MOMS - GET THIS FOR YOUR TEEN!  About 3 years ago we noticed a black-spot on my son's cheek. We thought it was a mole or an ingrown hair, until today. After a warm exfoliation, my son used the Body Toolz Loop and realized he actually had a nasty black-head on his cheep - he now has an indentation (pock-mark).  I really wish I had known about this product a long time ago."
5812,1,"Great mirror_What a great value.  This is the best shower mirror I've used.  Pretty large field of view, nice and light, easy to rinse, pretty strong.  I've dropped it a few times without apparent ill effect.  After a month of use, the silvering on the mirror is starting to come off along the bottom edge, but it will have to get a lot worse to make any difference.  At this price point, I'm very impressed.One word of caution--the included hanging hook is permanent and nearly impossible to remove.  I placed it too low, and don't use it--instead, I use an inexpensive suction-cup hook, which I like better.  That also makes it easy to travel with the mirror."
6693,0,"Bad bottle._This Just Gel polish would not cure properly and smelled strongly of solvent. Apparently someone who had the bottle before me attempted to thin it with remover or nail polish thinner. Pure gel polishes shouldn't have a strong odor and even though I understand dark colors can be trickier and take longer to cure, they should still cure after a reasonable time to the same glossy, hard finish as any other gel polish color. Mine left a thick film of uncured, pigmented polish, and the part that cured was dull and porous. I had the same problem with some clearance Gelishes from Sally Beauty. I was new to gel polishes at the time and imagine my frustration trying to get them to work!I will still buy this product again, because it's obvious the one I got was defective or tampered in some way.Purchased from Beauty Chain, who immediately approved the return, though I still need to research how to legally ship back a nail polish containing a flammable substance.Update 2014-02-22: Amazon (not BeautyChain) credited me for the purchase after I explained the dilemma, and they didn't require me to mail it back."
5348,1,"The jury is still out_I have used this 1 or 2 times so far over BB cream, I have very oily and shiny skin so I was hoping this would set my BB cream but Im not sure if this fits the cause. Will try it some more but it was a good buy to add to my makeup collection"
6370,0,"NOT A GOOD LIPSTICK_I do like other E.L.F. products, but not this paticular one. I usually put a coat of chapstick over my lips before i put any lipstick on, so maybe thats why it wouldnt show up. Well anyway, i attempted to put the lipstick on, but  for the life of me i could not get it to show up on my lips! I guess i cant complain for paying 25 cent lol. I am going to try it without chapstick, give you an update."
6840,1,"luv it!_First of all, the product arrived much sooner than I expected. When I used it, it was better than what I thought it would be. I can dry both hands at the same time.(both feet as well). Now I do my own gel nails at home. This product does exactly what it says, I feel like it's a great investment. Luv it!"
291,1,"Great product._I love this cream.  It is pretty strong, though.  Be careful at first.  I can only use it one or two times a week, and I need to keep it off my neck because it's just too harsh for that delicate skin.  Also, it will eventually bleach out your eyebrows and the hair around your hairline.  Nonetheless, this cream keeps my skin looking fresh and is having good effects on the areas that have a few lines.  I used to get a glycolic acid peel every month, but that got expensive.  I think regular use of this cream is nearly as good."
554,1,I get so many compliments_This is a great color and I love the matte finish. If your going to have Russian Red lips I don't think they should be shiny (for me anyhow). It took awhile to get this delivery but I will buy again.
1008,1,"Worked well for a good amount of time_This stuff was a lifesaver for awhile. I wore it in replacement of my standard face lotion and it certainly helped to clear up my face without drying it out. Unfortunately for me, about a couple months after use, my body grew immune to its wonderful effects and my acne came back. I have crazy acne so I assume this won't happen to other people, but it was certainly effective while it lasted. I would definitely recommend this to people who have the issue of feeling &#34;greasy&#34; halfway through the day."
3897,1,"GREAT PRODUCT._The product is great, however, I will have to look for something with the dropper instead, you waste too much product trying to shake it to get a drop out of it.  So the product itself is great, the delivery system SUCKS!"
5248,1,"BEST MASCARA EVER!_This is a classic. Buy it. You'll not regret it!. Great color, great volume, it's not clumpy... my favorite mascara so far!"
1014,1,"Big Bar_This is a big bar of soap and does cut easily into four bars.  I like it, it is gentle and does not smell too strongly, but each section does not seem to last very long.  Since I don't think it qualified for free shipping, I don't know if I would order it again.  Not sure it is any better than the olive oil soap I can buy for much less in my health food store with no shipping cost."
721,1,"I love my CHI Straightener_I've been using mine for years and it still works :D I love love love it, keeps my hair straight all day."
5416,1,"works well for sticking gems to your skin_I got this to use with glitter I got from a makeup place, but never ended up using it.  I did use it recently to stick nail gems to my face, and they stayed nicely.  :)"
9993,1,"Love how it makes my skin feel!_I have been using this product for a few days now and i love it so far, it has left my skin radiant, love how soft my face feels.  I have spoken to a few friends and family members of mine and have shared how much i love this product so they can see how it makes their skin feel.  I would purchase again!"
405,1,Thank you neutrogena_This is the best I ever used. I like it very much. It makes my life full of good-hair day.
115,0,"Thick and kind of grossT_This has the exact consistency, color, and smell as room temperature butter. It is moisturizing but it doesn't work well for my skin since it makes me break out. Plus, it made me feel like I was smearing butter all over my face, which turned me off to this product.Will not purchase again."
1209,0,"Drying cleanser_This cleanser did not do what it says it does - hydrate. Instead, it left my skin dry & ashy looking even before pat drying my skin!!!!!! Complete waste of my money. Will NEVER buy this again and no, I won't be telling anyone to try it."
5963,1,"Fantastic!_I ordered this product on a whim, as I've recently begun a somewhat frantic search for products that would give my hair some volume and style without heat. My hair is mid-back and very damaged due to daily heat styling and monthly coloring. It's also very thin, straight, and frizzy with lots of breakage. I tried this product not expecting much, but WOW am I surpised at the results. I sprayed it liberally on damp hair after shampooing and then scrunched it really well. It took a while to dry and during this time I occasionally added a little more product and kept scrunching (not constantly, but now and then throughout the drying period. I mention this because other reviewers have said to spray and then leave it alone to get the best effect. I defintely didn't leave it alone, and the effect is awesome!). But the time it was dry, it looks like this is someone else's hair! It looks healthy with amazing waves and texture. I am so happy that I just ordered another bottle so that I don't run out! Having my hair look so fantastic with no heat styling is a small miracle. Very happy!Also: I didn't experience any of the stiffness or crunchiness that others have experienced. This likely is a factor of how much is applied (though I certainly didn't skimp). And, as nearly everyone else mentioned, the smell is amazing. I think I've met my new best friend! I will be using this most days, I suspect."
2126,1,"Good value_I usually buy these in CVS drugstore, but on here you get three.  I travel very often so take these with me. If I lose one or forget one in a hotel- no big deal. Have extras."
7149,0,"Didn't work for me_I have some mild acne scars and uneven skin tone with slight redness on my cheeks and sides of my nose.  I've been using this product for a few months.  It works ok as a serum, but I don't observe improvement in the dark spots and redness.  Everyone's skin is different, and I'm Asian, so I can't conclude that it won't be effective for someone else.It is worth trying because it's inexpensive, and as I said, works ok as a serum in general."
2963,1,"Luxurious_I love this product.  I've been using it about a week, and it was a perfect way to get rid of my dry winter skin.  My skin is softer and smoother.  This is very luxurious, it's the consistency of a cream hair conditioner.  It doesn't lather up too much, but enough to feel like you are getting clean.The smell is nice -- clean and fresh, but not too strong.There is a slight shimmer -- nothing that would excite a 12 year old girl, or embarrass a thirty-eight year old woman.  It barely shows up, but might have something to do with the 'better skin tone' and appearance that it promises."
8981,0,"Nope, didn't work for me_The first time I took it out of the tube the tip was just blobbled with mascara, more than any other I've ever used.  More blobs stuck in the bristles.  I tried and tried to get some of mascara off the brush, but it was still too blobby, and went on very clumpy.  I wore it once, and it just didn't do a thing for my long, but light lashes.  Threw this out after one wearing.I'm a mascara junkie and won't buy this or recommend it."
647,1,Love_This has made my damaged hair more healthy and shiny.  Works immediately and smells great too! And no alcohol added.
1223,1,Wonderful cleanser!_Obagi make great skin products.  The Cleanser is gentle on the skin.  I have been using Obagi products for years.  If you buy these products from a dermatologist they are much more expensive.  These are very reasonably priced on Amazon..
4619,1,"Simply the Best!_I've been using this product for 2 weeks now. And I can say my oily hair and scalp is well cleansed! Seems to bring out the color of my hair leaving it shiner, tangle-free and better managed. No soapy or waxy residue. I also noticed that this shampoo balances secretion of oil glands very well in my scalp leaving it itch-free and my hair oil/dirt free. Amazingly, NO other conditioners needed. The composition of this shampoo is excellent!Simply the best natural shampoo I've ever used. Will buy again. Highly recommended for those of us with normal/oily hair and scalp.Just a small note: it may take a week or so to 'detox' hair and scalp of common chemical residue and buildup as stated on bottle which is true if you have used other shampoos that contain parabens, propylene, butylene glycols, petroleum, sulfates, alcohol, PEGs, TEA, DEA, NPE, phthalates, GMO, silicones, pesticides, artificial dyes or fragrances."
5218,1,Watch the videos on Youtube and see for yourself_This little roller is cheap to buy and works very well.  I believe it does the exact same thing that the Radio Frequency machines do.  Not as sophisticated but it get the job done.  It does what it says.  Watch the videos on Youtube and see for yourself.  I try and use it more often than I do however.  I think I would be able to give a better review.  But I like it and think it would help fine lines deminish if used regularly.
5482,1,"Better than regular bobby pins_Between the fact that I have heavy, baby fine hair that bobby pins fall right out of and the fact that I suck at doing hair, pinning up my hair is next to impossible. I had high hopes for these spin pins, and overall I'm very pleased. While I found the claim on the box that you only need 2 pins to put your hair in a bun to be completely false, they do actually hold my hair if I use enough of them. I used 4 and my bun lasted all day. Putting the pins in is very easy, but getting them out can be a little complicated."
2269,1,"Pricey, but Well Worth It_Although this little tub of powder can seem costly, a little goes a LONG WAY, and the results are well worth it.  It puts a final polish on my made up face, and when I'm in full daylight I've had friends comment about the appearance of my skin.  If you knew my skin, you would know why that is so remarkable.  Just a fine dusting using a dense powder brush over my made up face is all I need.  I touch up throughout the day by first using oil blotting sheets and then dusting another light coat over my face.  Love it."
8727,0,"OMG_I read the reviews on the smell of this product and should have listened.  I don't know if this product works or not because the smell is like Vicks Vapor Rub.  It is truly nasty and strong.  So if you don't mind smelling like a medicine cabinet, go for it. Otherwise, go with something else.  The only good thing I can say about this product is that the spray bottle works good."
8209,1,"Lasting color_I bought these for my teenage daughter and she loves them, I ordered another set for my Mother and she loves them, so next I will order for myself. Amazing lasting colors."
9287,1,works great_Exfoliating towels you say?  Yeah I had never herd of them either until I agreed to review them in return for a free product and let me tell you they worked very well. You can literally feel and see the difference as they clean the dead skin off you. Though they are a little rough so don&#8217;t push to hard.
2393,1,Great Products_These work together for your skin. I saw a local Dermatologist was having a special on these products.I figured if he was selling them they must work. They do. My skin looks amazing. Will purchase again.
5679,1,Great Lotion_Makes your skin very soft.  Not oily or heavy.  I like having my sunscreen in my moisturizing lotion.  I also us CeraVe PM lotion.
5987,1,"Well designed hair dryer - quiet and powerful_With so many hairdryers out in the market right now, it is difficult to decide between so many different models.Some thoughts:From my own and my wife's experience with this hair dryer, we've found that the design and the performance is what sets this apart from other good mid-range hair dryers ($30 - $50). This hair dryer is powerful, but not overbearing. Oddly enough, neither my nor my wife's hair feels burned or hot. The airflow is efficient and effective.It's perfect for personal use if you're looking for some extra 'oomph,' as well as the option to keep your curls and preserve silky hair with the ceramic attachment. Excellent choice for personal  use, and perhaps good for simple tasks at salons. This hair dryer is not for the weak ;)DesignWow! Conair really did a good job designing this dryer. The handle, the feel of the dryer is fluid, comfortable, and very intuitive. There are three heat settings: hot, warm, cold. This may seem odd to point out, but each heat setting is accurate. Other hair dryers I've tried had heat settings there were off and inaccurate. The switch for the heat settings are caved in, preventing any accidental switches.Overall, a very well designed hair dryer that offers reliable and good performance.You also may want to consider the older model of the infiniti pro: Infiniti Pro by Conair AC Motor Styling Tool, Orange and theConair 213XP Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, BlackCheers and treat your hair well!"
8332,1,"Shield_This face wash doesn't have the strong Axe Effect smell that I am used to in Axe products. I guess that is good because you will use the same face wash every day, unlike a deodorant or a body wash where you may have multiple flavors on hand. This is a very mild moisturizer, but it works well enough."
3686,1,"I adore this - easy for tomboys!_I am not a girly girl at all. I wish I was, but I have never seen the value in investing great amounts of time in hairstyling when I could be doing more productive and pleasurable, such as sleeping later in the mornings. Usually I just wash, condition, dry, and I'm on my way, the most effort I put into my hair is pulling it up into a ponytail or making one of those nifty buns with an office pen stuck in the back, so I look studious.Lately though, I've wanted to play around with my hair more often, and was toying with the idea of a perm. My best friend/stylist suggested that I try using a curling iron first, to see if I liked the idea. I bought many standard curling irons - I have like 5 now, languishing in my junk drawer - but never had any luck. My hair would not hold a curl regardless of the amount of product I used. I finally had my friend come over and try as well, but even with her expertise and professional tools, my hair is so fine it would only limply hold curls, and looked pretty pathetic.So, I figured I'd try one last time. I spent quite a bit of time on Amazon reading reviews, watching tutorials on Youtube, etc, and finally decided on the HerStyler. My main deciding factor - I could get it in purple.I am SO glad I got it, as well! Used prime shipping, so of course it was at my door in two days. I immediately began playing with it, and was shocked when I was able to create beautiful soft tendrils WITHOUT product in my hair. And they stayed until I washed my hair the next morning. It's an awesome way for someone to quickly do their hair - I just put a few messy beachy looking curls in and call it good. It looks amazing, my hair is shinier than ever, and it barely takes any time.My only complaint about the HerStyler is the glove. It's not heat resistant at all, I found myself burning my fingers by the time I'd done about 3/4 of my head. I ended up using an Ov-Glove, and while ugly, it works much better."
4542,1,"Not too bad for thick/coarse hair_Every hair stylist I've been to has always told me to steer away from products that list alcohol among the first ingredients, Pantene being among them.I've tried hair products that cost between $3 and $60 with so little difference.  I don't know if it's because I have thick hair, but there's only so much that topical agents can do.  Like others, I've not noticed any difference in the end result with this conditioner.  What's surprising is that I haven't had to use as much conditioner as I normally do.  It goes a long way.This has a 'clean' scent to it...not flowery or perfumey.  Does well in detangling hair, and it might be more economical than other Pantene conditioners since less is needed.  No matter what your favorite is, you always need to rotate products to avoid product buildup."
1940,1,Great Product_This is a very good product.  I use it on My face and in the shower.  Deep cleans and softens.
9018,1,"I love this set!_This set is much better than the 1st Pueen set. I fell in love with the design of this set, it's very elegant and just beautiful. They stamp really good and no more pesky half moon curve. They are all full nails which I love! Overall I'm very happy with it! Well done!"
1213,0,Whatever_Well its just a bad smelling soap. Nothing more nothing less. And god forbid you use a white wash cloth to apply the soap. I will never buy again. But it is black. So 2 stars for not being complete liars. LOL
7512,0,"Didn't receive what I paid for._I purchased the 45 piece mix bows for nails, and received only one color, green.. Not only were they only one color I had no interest for, They only sent me 20!! Very disappointed.. Wish I could return them, but instead going to try ordering another batch to see if that one was just a mix up."
1107,1,"Very nice_I decided to try making my own body butter,  I did a little research and found that shea butter is a really great thing and an excellent base for this project.  I now use it from face to foot instead of all the seperate moisturizers, lotions oils, and butters.  With that in mind this 4 oz tub has lasted over a month.  I also gave a little to my husband.  He suffers from sever patches of dry skin on his legs in the winter that itch so badly he scratches til they bleed.  He uses this every time it starts to itch and that is the end of that."
774,1,"Great Moisturizer!_I have eczema and need as much skin hydration as possibly from a body wash.Have tried Axe products and others, but so far Dove and Olay get my votes as hands-down the best moisturizing body washes that you can get most anywhere.The scent isn't over-powering, it works in easy, and my skin feels like it retains water without getting dry an hour after a shower.That's all I ask from a body wash, and Dove delivers."
4874,0,Yuk_I never wore these eye lashes because they look to fake. They don't look good. I wear eyelashes all the time but don't waste a penny on them. They are not good.
3588,1,"Bang- Ginger Blonde_I think this is the neatest thing ever!!! I like having the option to have bangs without the commitment of cutting my hair. I did have to curl the hair since it has flat in the box, but doing what the directions said I was able to curl them with no problem."
419,0,"Itchy, uncomfortable_These patches remind me of pieces of envelope paper with glue on them. They have hard edges which I find uncomfortable and itchy. It's difficult to sleep with them on and in the morning, yes they temporarily flatten lines, but at the expense of a border in the shape of the Frownie showing all around the area they were plastered to. A few facial expressions later and, voila!, you have the border AND the wrinkle. Don't waste your money."
4258,1,"Cute and high-quality_This is a high-quality, sturdy, well-made shower cap with an adorable design.  The pink micro-terry lining is a nice touch.  I got one for myself, but it would be a great gift."
5995,1,"Pretty Good_As long as you cut the &#34;stringy&#34; ends off, they work just fine. They do not come with glue. Over all I am pleased."
9929,1,"Love this cream_This stuff really does a good job of controlling breakouts. I tried it on a spot that was coming out and the next day the redness was quite reduced. It won;t completely get rid of the pimple, well not in my case but helps reduce it and along with the other products in this line, drys the acne out faster."
4521,1,"They work for a few seconds_These cool off toilettes work well when you first use them, but of course the cooling effect does not last long. I used in a recent trip to Europe and they help in situations like in the back of a taxi that doesn't have air conditioning, but it is only a temporary measure."
5708,1,"Pleasantly surprised!_Really wasn't sure how I'd like this one, but it's one of my many favorites. I absolutely love the rich plum color - very classy. I would not describe the color as berry at all - it's a beautiful subtle plum. As with all gelish colors, thin coats all the way!"
922,1,"Tea Tree Junkies_We started with this and later incorporated Dr. Bronners Tea Tree Soap which we now use for shampoo, body & face wash.  We add this to water bottles to clean with or to the laundry.  Great Stuff!btw my daughter bought some BeeBee (sp?) &#34;hair tonic&#34; from the salon for $21 and I tried it and what do you know?  smelled like tea tree oil!  sure enough, 1st ingredient!"
5376,1,"AWESOME._omg this plate are probably the easiest thing to use they are so simple. and they just gives your nails a little cute design it takes literally no time at all, and they are so affordable."
9677,1,"Valentia C Serum_I am a firm believer In using good natural organic skincare on our delicate faces, I have been using this Valentia Skin Care Even Glow Serum for about 2 weeks now, and I personally enjoy the smell the way it quickly absorbs into my skin. Even Glow Serum has a nice orange citrus smell to it and a thick Serum. I personally have been using it every night after washing my face!!I apply it to my clean face and make sure my face sit for a min or so for it is completely dry, and then I apply the serum to my face and let it soak in to my skin, I have been applying all over my face and my eye area, Side note when applying to your eye area use your ring finger that is your weakest finger, and tissue around the eye area are very thin skin and much more delicate so use TLC there. I also applied it to my decollete area that area somehow always gets left out I notice some people never apply there!! Important to apply there!! Love the way this serum seeps into the skin leaving it with a nice healthy glow.Also I will start applying this in the morning, I just did it at night for I wouldn't have to apply makeup, But it is meant for both Day and Night!!  Because Vitamin C helps Smooth and Firm skin and fades brown spots by inhibiting the free radicals that trigger wrinkling, sagging, the many things we get to look forward to as we age lol, So for that reason you should apply this even Glow Serum in the morning to protect your skin from free radicals caused by sun damage!! I highly recommend this Vitamin C Serum ***** 5 Stars"
2141,0,VERY strong scent_I received a sample of this body milk and tried it today.  I would not put it on in the morning as I think co-workers would be able to smell it. The blood orange scent smells more like the chewable baby aspirin we had when I was a kid.  Note that it is a 'body milk' - so it has a thin consistency and doesn't moisturize as much as a lotion or cream.  Between the overpowering scent and the high price I am not a fan of this product.
65,1,"One of my favorites_This is a great item for a gal with oily hair. I try other things, but always go back to this shampoo. Totally affordable, cleans nicely, but doesn't strip my hair. I love it."
8698,1,"Moisturizing, cleansing, well priced_I really like these wipes. They are easy to dispense from the package and the package reseals easily preventing drying out. The wipes are very soft yet strong and cleansing. They are wet enough to clean but do not drip or cause a mess. There is Mango extract in these wipes and you can faintly smell mango. The wipes are unscented but the touch of mango from the mango extract is really nice and refreshing. The wipes held up without tearing or pilling. They left my face feeling soft, clean and with a lingering moisturized feeling. The ingredients are simple and easy to understand."
260,1,"Color is different than my usual choices_You can't go wrong with OPI.  The color is different than what I normally buy.  Nice for a change. Nail polish is all about the base coat and top coat, but doing everything right OPI lasts better than most."
1232,1,"Great shampoo and conditioner_I use this on myself relaxed hair and my girls hair who is relaxed and natural, It doesnt leave a heavy build up and leaves it moisturized. It also good at detangling. I love matrix products."
1502,0,"Oh,i wish_I loved this product as much as other...I wanted to I really did but it left my hair so dry like weeds or hay I I had to wear my hair it in a pony tail and then a lot of my hair came out because of the dryness. I'm not sure who hair this is made for but not mine and I have curly hair so I thought it would be perfect. Better luck next time..."
4009,1,"Good stuff!_It works.  It smells good and keeps me from getting sunburned, which is what I ask of a sunscreen lotion."
1203,1,"My second favorite tanner_I was told that this came with a mitt, but it didn't, so that was disappointing.However, the color is great. Once I mastered putting it on smoothly, it's a nice dark color, but not too orange. My favorite self tanner is Fake Bake Flawless, but the color takes more applications to get as dark as this one.The initial smell is fine. It's pretty sweet smelling. However, on my skin, the self tan smell is pretty apparent after it starts working.I love the fact that it has the color guide. It makes application soooo much easier.A word of advice: If you get sunburned and peel, do NOT use this (or any other self tanner). I didn't even think about it, but when it developed, the color was super dark and long lasting where I had already peeled and light everywhere else. Exfoliate, exfoliate exfoliate."
8080,0,"Very poor quality makeup._This product is not worth buying, even if it is just a buck or two. I used it for winged eye liner and within 5 minutes the entire eyeliner peeled right off as if it was a sticker!. Complete waste of money."
8963,1,"Keith Urban Fantastic_Heard that this was a good spa like deep cleanser. I have no breakouts ever and never did, but is great for exfoliating....and after your skin is SO SOFT!!! Gone are the dry top layers."
9997,1,Great supplement - my skin looks and feels tighter - ..._Great supplement - my skin looks and feels tighter - I was really starting to see damage after years of sunning - its nice to see some reversal
5470,1,Makes me happy when I put it on :)_I really like this blush. I don't normally wear blush which I should since I am so white (haha) but I have never really found one that doesn't have a lot of shimmer to it and that doesn't make me look like a clown. This one doesn't! I am so happy about that too since this is such a cute little blusher that I just really wanted to like it. I got it in Natural because I felt that Rose would be too pink for me. The natural really does look natural. It gives my cheeks a very nice natural looking color and I don't look painted up or anything. It goes on really smoothly and is buildable so if I want a little more pop of color I can achieve that.
4716,1,nice_This was perfect for what I needed. It does the job and its lasting for a long time. I've had it since last year
3136,1,Adds some volume to hair and is sulfate free_My daughter liked this because it did add some volume to her hair. I liked it because it is sulfate free and will do less damage to her hair than other shampoos.
2147,1,"It's our favorite sunblock_We've been using Neutrogena sunblocks in the summer for several years now and, given that most of our summers are spent in the sun, by the pool or at the beach, I think I have some authority to state that I am happy with this product.The SPF 45 spray features:- UVA/UVB protection- Helioplex for keeping the product effective longer- a very fine dry mist- low odor- seems to stay effective for several hours- I don't need to re-apply it after swimmingI disagree with the maker's claim that it 'resists running into eyes'. My personal experience is that you should not apply this anywhere near your eyes unless you have easy access to an abundant water supply to wash it off. Use some dry stick for the areas near your eyes or for your entire face if possible.Besides that, this is definitely our favorite sunblock. We buy a dozen or so spray cans of various SPF levels (we use SPF 70 in Florida) and a few sticks and out family of 5 is good for the season. We haven't experienced any sunburns lately.Since this is THE sunblock we use and we don't use anything else, I am compelled to award this product the 5 stars it clearly deserves.__________________________________________True story. I know it's true because it happened to me, a few days ago.One lazy Saturday afternoon, having completed my 100 or so laps, I am in the back of the house, reading a book and sipping some drink, Scotch and soda. A bunch of kids are splashing in the pool, dogs running around, over-excited - they are not allowed in the pool area. And I notice T., circling around, making herself look busy, a hesitant, uncomfortable look on her face. She's my wife's girlfriend, a neighbor, and she's married too, 3 little girls. Her 6 yr. old one of our 6 yr. old's best friends. I keep reading, enjoying the day, sipping my Scotch.To make it short, she seems to find the needed energy to address me directly.A., she says, what are you wearing?Svimvear I says (a joke, she's from Russia).No, no, no, she says, what perfume are you wearing? Or is it your aftershave?T., what are you talking about? No perfume, says I. I just came out of the pool.But, A., you smell soooo good, says she. My husband never smells like this. Why can't my husband smell like you do?Ahhhh... I finally realize, it's GOT to be the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Body Mist Sunblock Spf 70 5 Oz. I'm wearing.True story."
7142,0,"Made my hair look unwashed._My curls may have been shiny after the product application, but they were shiny like unwashed, greasy hair is shiny.  The healthy shine was not present at all.  Also, the product is heavy, such that my hair was still greasy hours after I put it in.  I was hoping for an alternative to mousse, which though it keeps curls in also renders hair 'crispy' feeling.  I cannot recommend this product."
832,1,"BARATO E BOM_Este &eacute; um exemplo de um produto bom e barato. Pelo preo voc no d&aacute; nada, mais &eacute; muito bom."
8991,1,"Great moisturizer_I purchased this to help with my sensitive, dry winter skin. This has a pump and administers a small amount so no contamination of a jar and is opaque so no degradation of antioxidants with light exposure. the thin moisturizer blends in well and leaves my skin feeling dewey. would definitely recommend."
190,1,"good cream, good dispenser_Good cream, it cover well my face, the dispenser control really well how much you want to use.The system of the dispenser protect the cream of not being contaminated, because it never expose the cream to the contact of the hand or air."
711,1,"Would purchase more_It is not greasy, and absorbs quickly. I have used itfor two months, and I did see the improvement around my eyes. It is one of the best eye cream I have ever used. I would purchase more for sure."
6575,1,Super girly!_I love these!! I get to be extra creative with my manicures every week!!! This lasts a LONG time too. :)
4549,1,"I LOVE this face wash!!!_I LOVE St Ives green tea face wash! (I bought 5 bottles because it performs so awesome!) It has really helped clear up my skin and be less oily. It is non-drying, and smells amazing! It has some great natural ingredients in it, and I love that there are no parabens! And how can you beat the price!?!!? St Ives performs just as well as brands that are 5x the price. I definitely recommend it!"
3444,1,"Olay?  Okay._Rather than go into my normal diatribe, I will keep this review short and simple.  The results are representative of good anti-wrinkle treatments (no miracles, but tangible softening of fine lines) and contains a good SPF.  Unfortunately, it also caused breakouts.  If finding the fountain of youth also requires going back to teenage acne, I guess it would be worth it.  However, for a normal mid-range product, you may want to stay away if your skin is sensitive.  If not, this could be a good product to try.  Everyone's skin reacts differently to these products and I hope your experience is a positive one."
8017,1,"No clumps_This mascara is billed as a no clump product, and I have found that to be true.  The brush allows the mascara to be applied lightly.  I consider this the perfect casual or office mascara, as it gives lashes some definition without an overdone look.  This is not the one to use, though, for a night out when you want a really 'heavy' lash look.  Recommended."
8051,1,"A DREAM COME TRUE!_I have used this product only a few times. But I LOVE IT SO MUCH! It makes my hair appear thicker and healthier, full of bounce and body, without making it sticky, gooey, stiff, or anything else. Fifteen tiny squirts above the earline rubbed into my hair and then a quick blow dry and I have the head of hair I've always wanted. Just plain incredible! Honestly, I do not work for the company. I do not get any benefit by saying nice things about this treatment. For my thin, aging, long, limp, graying hair this product is absolute perfection!"
8440,1,"It Does Tame That Frizzy Hair While Conditioning_Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control Nourishing Daily Conditioner actually does tame frizzy hair when used with Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control Nourishing Shampoo.I noticed a difference after using it one time and the look of my hair only improved with each additional shampooing followed by the use of this conditioner. Even the ends of my long hair feel soft and nourished instead of feeling like brittle, dry, straw.The scent is very pleasant and not over the top strong. This conditioner is rich and silk smooth and rinses out well.Excellent product."
5236,1,Nice color_nice color when used with a eyeshadow primer and  it shows up great it a light color so you should add it kinda heavy
3552,1,"Really Like These Brushes :)_Immediately upon receiving these brushes I washed both the case and each brush (thoroughly) with a gentle, mild soap. The case is nice but has a really strong smell and I found that washing the case and letting it dry really helped cut that down. I used Dr. Bronner's Magic Soap (diluted) to wash both the brushes and case as it's my probably my favorite soap ever (I use it on practically everything...). After that I used a bit of olive oil (any kind of kitchen oil would probably work, my favorite is pure olive oil though) to coat the brushes a TINY bit (I rub a little oil on my hands and then gently go through each brush coating them lightly). I do this method on all my makeup brushes after washing them. This helps makes them softer, helps them keep their shape better, and replenishes a bit of the natural oils the brushes have (made from goat and badger hair).After that I let the brushes air dry -each one in their slots with the case rolled out on my kitchen countertop. It took about a day (overnight) for everything to dry completely.Really love these brushes. They are made of all natural goat & badger hair (which I love &#60;3). Also love that SHANY is a member of PETA and so I know that the animals didn't suffer at all, which I really, really love.I recently switched a lot of my makeup to mineral based and need my makeup brushes to work well. These do and help me create all the looks I want and help me stretch the boundaries of a lot of my mineral makeup. (BTW, my favorite brand is Honeybee Gardens. Their mineral foundation is AMAZING. It has better coverage than any liquid foundation I've ever use and makes your skin look so nice, glowy, and smooth, while controlling shine. I also use their loose mineral eyeshadows (stackable pots) and these brushes really, really come in handy in using them to create my different looks).Really pleased with these brushes. :-)"
4990,1,"Natural looking_I have long, thick, and black eyelashes and was looking for falsies to enhance their look during special occasions. I didn't want lashes that looked fake. These lashes did exactly what I wanted them to do."
208,1,"Works great!_My skin is softer and more supple.  It has reduced the appearance of lines and improved the texture of my skin, making it softer and younger looking.  It has also managed to reduce the darkness of my under eye circles, something that many other products claiming to do that failed at! I highly recommend this!"
7884,1,"Perfect and Nice price_It's really nice, works well, and came quickly also very reasonably priced! I would definitely buy again or recommend to a friend!"
6695,1,"Perfect contemporary natural color_I love this polish. This shade is the perfect shade for my pale skin with pink undertones. And I find IBD better than CND. Well, some of my CND works very well, but some I find shrinks. This does not shrink at all.The only &#34;complaint&#34; I have isn't really a complaint, but is more to do with application and my learning curve. I applied the two color coats a little thicker on the first hand than the second and they look different. I wish I had noticed before I applied the top coat! Not sure if I can apply a color coat atop the cured top coat.I guess the good news is it's easy to apply thin coats to achieve different looks.Love this polish and color! Will purchase again and look forward to trying other IBD polishes."
2128,1,"AMAZING!!!_I absolutely love this product! My eyes are very small and crease very easily. I used this product under the NYX jumbo eye pencils (and if you've used those before, you know those are famous for how bad they crease) and my eye shadow lasted ALL DAY with NO creases!!! :O Very pleasantly surprised! Love it and will be buying the glitter glue shortly!"
9728,1,"Great Fresh Scent_I personally love body washes, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  It has a fresh grapefruit scent that will make you feel very fresh and clean.  I will say that I think that is very comparable to more expensive body washes.  It lathers up well, and a little goes a long way.I would definitely try more of these Caress Body Washes."
8299,1,"Shampoo and conditioner combo work well on my thick hair_I dye my hair a very dark brown color each month to help cover the grey hairs I've been plagued with since my early 20's. Because I use a dark hair color, when it starts to fade, it's very noticeable. After years of trying different shampoos, I've found that ones that are formulated to help retain hair color, really do help some. It's not going to keep your hair color from fading at all, but it does fade it less than shampoos not formulated in the same way.Before trying out this shampoo and conditioner, I was using Pantene shampoo and Garnier Fructis conditioner. My hair is quite thick and currently pretty long, and I try to find hair care products that help keep my hair smooth and easy to manage. If I use something that helps retain my hair color and doesn't provide any kind of smoothing or shine, my hair becomes dried out and frizzy. So I was eager to see how my hair would look after using this Suave Moroccan Infusion Color Care shampoo and conditioner. Neither have a lot of color or scent. The conditioner has a sweet scent that's unlike any other hair product I've used. The shampoo has a very mild scent, that's also unusual. More of a soap or mild perfume smell, than the typical citrus or floral scent.The shampoo bottle opens from the top, and the conditioner bottle opens from the bottom. So even though they look very similar, when the bottle are setting beside each other, you can easily tell which bottle it which by how they open. After using them on my hair, the first thing I noticed was that it was a bit easier to run my brush through my hair while it was wet. So the Suave conditioner made my hair less tangley after washing than my Garnier Fructis conditioner. After drying my hair, I was quite pleased with how it looked and felt. It was smooth and reminded me of the was one of my favorite shampoos makes my hair look, Pantene Ice Shine. I would normally always use the Ice Shine shampoo, but it doesn't help hold in my dark hair dye. So I'm very pleased to find that this gives my hair the same look and feel as I get when I use my Pantene Ice Shine, but with the hair color protection as well. So while it might not have bright colors and bold fragrances like some brands use, the shampoo and conditioner do work very well."
5978,1,love all the colors_used product for nail art - stamping and it works great.  colors are vibrant and thick consistency for nail art.  great price
5284,1,"Life is better._My hair LOVES this stuff! (so do my knees and elbows when I'm done lol) This product does exactly what it says, and it will smooth out and nourish your hair wet or dry, I can't believe I found it at such a good price! My newest staple product, for sure."
7276,1,"Top choice_By far the best self tanner i ever used, no smell, no stickiness, inexpensive, stays on for a reasonable amount of time ,,, about 4 days for me, def recommend it!"
5395,1,"LA VIDA LOCA_I am pleased with the scent.  I love, love the bottle. I purchased this for my oldest granddaughter for Christmas and I am sure she will love it. The price was great and I received it in a very short time. I am very picky when it comes to parfum and this one is a winner. Great costumer service!"
1959,1,"Nature knows best..._Okay people - I always do my research before buying a new product. I read up, down, sideways, and backwards before buying this. I have been making my own facial masks for years, using ingredients that we all probably have located in our kitchens. Natural is the ONLY way to go in way of skin care, some people might disagree with my there, but to each their own. No one knows your skin as well as YOU do - you are the one living under there. Anyways, I am a licensed cosmologist, and unfortunately through the every day use of harsh chemicals found in everyday products, I developed a major allergy. All things from shampoo to lotion to body sprays, make me break out and itch, turning red from head to toe. It was quite embarrassing and annoying to say the least. Over the years, I have weeded out almost all of chemical products to replace them with things that are all natural, and that I can make on my own. Not only has this saved me lots of money, but I have almost completely rid myself of my skin irritations. I am always on the look out for new, natural products that I haven't tried before. I came across this clay through Amazon, and like I said, I researched till I was blue in the face. I decided to give it a shot.WOW. You really can feel the mask PULSATING against your skin, drawing out whatever lurks deep down in there. I have a pretty clean, chemical free lifestyle, but this mask was still able to reach down deep and draw out impurities. I peeled the dry mask off of my nose, and could see my blackheads coming with it, like you would in a Biore pore strip. It was pretty amazing.Ladies and Gents, if you break out after using this product ONE time, please do not feel discouraged. Simple, as other reviews have stated, the mask is drawing all of the dirt to the top of the skin. Hang in there, it takes time for your skin and body to push out all of the  gunk. Give it a chance to really work.You can also use this product to take a detox bath, which I have yet to try but will definitely do so soon. You could also put it in a foot soak, make it thinner to do hair/scalp treatment, or put it over any part of your body you'd like to detox.My next goal is to find a good food grade clay, to take to detox the inside of the body. People (and animals) have been detoxing with clay for centuries. Unfortunately, Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay, is not food grade, and for external use only. But I would 100% recommend for anyone to try this clay. Our skin and bodies are not meant to have chemicals slathered all over them from night till day! This really DETOXES you, so be prepared. Also - I would recommend to put a moisturizer on ASAP once you take the mask off, as it can be drying. I used organic jojoba, or my second fave organic coconut oil. Happy detoxing!****UPDATE 12/14/13****I still LOVE this mask, and I even got my man to used it. I must say....PLEASE do not OVER USE. I did make that mistake. My skin shriveled and dried up, and was very flakey. I got over excited at the wonderful benefits that I saw in my first few times using this product. This mask REALY gets in there and SUCKS out everything, so please do not over use. I would say after your first few times, maybe once every 2.5 weeks will be enough. The healing process took a while, but I was able to speed it up with my dry bush. After the flakes were gone, my nice healthy skin was back. I highly recommend, just please do not get too overzealous with this. Its far too powerful! Hope this helps :)"
5657,1,"So worth the money._The only reason why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the plastic handle is too wide for some of my nail polish bottles so I have to manipulate the bottle so the metal tips can reach the polish inside the bottles. I wish the handles tapered in or the metal parts were a little longer to help with this problem. However, considering the price, it is really worth the little I spent. I love it! Highly recommend."
176,1,"I love Aveeno!_Great product!  Made my skin smoother without irritating is (unscented version).  I really liek Aveeno and the price on Amazon was cheaper than the store, plus it was delivered right to my house!  I will definitely purchase it again!"
9373,1,"A wonderful serum my skin_A wonderful serum for my slowly aging skin, I love this product. Added vitamins help me stay young as I add drops to my face every morning for my skin routine.Light, non oily, and easy to use, I love this little pink labeled bottle. A little goes a long way,and my facial skin looks bright anew.I love it."
589,1,Biolage by Matrix Hydratherapie Hydrating Shampoo 33.8 Ounces_This is one of my favorite shampoos of all time I have used it since my grandmother turned me on to it. I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS ONE FOR SURE. doesn't take much for a person with short hair. Last for a great while. GREAT VALUE.
3637,1,"The best of the store brand moisturizers_One of my favorite daily hair moisturizers.  I'm black with arm pit length relaxed hair.  I usually prefer all natural moisturizers but those can be a bit pricey.  This is a great store brand moisturizer.  It doesn't have mineral oil or petralatum. One of the first ingredients is Shea Butter. It actually has coconut oil in it (unlike the products who say coconut and it's just mostly mineral oil and a coconut fragrance).  And it smell divine.I use a nickel sized amount each night before I go to bed and then seal my hair with pure extra virgin coconut oil. The next day my hair is shiny, moisturized, soft and not greasy.Just don't go overboard with it and you'll be okay."
4752,0,"Maybe it's the formula?_I had a deep suspicion why this product wasn't available in stores and I found out the hard way. Basically, my hair came no where near the color on the box. I got mixes of orange, mahogany and dark blonde. Needless to say, I wouldn't recommend this."
1304,0,mychelle eye cream fabulous_DO NOT GET CLOSE TO YOUR EYE. OUCH!!!! The consistency is very thin so it spreads too easily and gets into your eyes and hurts like heck. MINIMAL HYDRATION!!!!!!!!!!!!
703,1,worked great_I would recommend it. I have natural curly hair but this product helped enhance my hair. Made my curls look more natural.
2095,1,More effective than Sally H_This stuff is the perfect medium. It does soften and dissolve cuticles but it doesn't sting or soften and dissolve nails.
418,1,"Good product for the money.._RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream has actually helped my pores look smaller, which has been almost impossible with the other products I've used.  I think I'm going to like this very much!"
521,1,"Not going to rave yet, but pleased so far...._Just bought the flat iron today. I am pleased with the results so far. I'm not going to rave yet because the last flat iron which was also a remington I bought worked great at first also but quit working completely only 3 months later. I bought this from wal-mart also, not amazon but when I went on  wal-marts website to review it, I couldn't find this exact one. Anyways, haven't used it yet on wet hair but worked pretty well on dry hair. I have thick wavy hair."
1996,1,"my husband's fave for years now_He simply won't try another despite cheaper options out there.  It doesn't tingle his skin, smells nice & helps the indoor tan deepen."
5827,1,"Acne prone sensitive skin_Have suffered not only with a sensitive skin but with acne all my teen years and adult life as well, am very wary of any product that touches my face. So as a BzzAgent when I got the cleanser I did not think twice, as Burt's Bees is synonymous with natural and not so harsh ingredients. I love putting makeup and due to my acne scars my foundation goes on really thick, I need to wash my face at least twice before it feels cleans. But with this cleanser, a required very little and it cleaned my face and it did not make it feel dry. The skin is still soft and feels clean."
2943,1,"Great back up set!_I personally love all Shany's products!  This set of brushes is serving as a backup to my main set.  Sometimes as an MUA, when you are on set, you really need a variety of brushes as you may not have time for cleaning properly.  Thanks so much for this great set!"
4450,1,"Actually does work well!_I'm a skeptic & usually don't find things like this that actually work for me....I was happily surprised by this....I have fine hair which doesn't hold curl easily...this is easy to use, doesn't catch on my hair, kinda fun, and just gives me one more styling option....my hair goes about 2 inches below my shoulder....this would look great on people with long hair....if your hair is short, don't buy it, you need at least about 5 inches of length to use it well"
2274,1,"Been using for 2 months now!_I have very coarse, dry, curly hair. My stylist is trained in dry-cutting and all of the curly girl methods. She uses this on my hair in the salon along with the entire Deva Care line. I use this low-poo cleanser 3-4 times a week, and follow up with One-Condition. Two months later I am ready to post this review. After using these products my hair is not dull -  it is very shiny and strong. I am very pleased with this cleanser and just purchased the 32oz version. If you have dry, curly hair you should definitely never use products like Pantene, Garnier, Tresemme, etc... you really need to choose a moisturizing cleanser like this. I used Pantene as a child, into my teens, and when I moved out of my family home and remember how my hair felt like straw. So I switched to better products a few years ago including Avalon Organics (AO) Lavender shampoo and conditioner which are both very good. However, I do like the idea of &#34;low-poo&#34; cleanser because my hair needs to retain a lot of the natural oils that regular shampoos strip away. I don't think my hair days are any better than with the AO products but I do think my hair is well-moisturized and shiny with very limited frizz. Definitely buy this to try in combination with One-Condition. I shampoo, rinse, condition, rinse, and then add a little more conditioner back into my hair without rinsing. This is now my routine and it works!"
2241,1,"Good Quality Atomisers_I have no complaints about this product. I ordered a pair of these, and they work great, spray well, and do not leak. Come with two funnels that work fine as well. As usual with Amazon orders, fast and easy."
14,1,"Inexpensive Perfection_As long as this eyeliner is applied correctly there should be no peeling, fading or flaking.  The only time I get some flaking or peeling is if I apply it too thickly. I put this on early in the morning (7am or so) and don't take it off until 11 or 12 pm.  And in all that time it stayed where I put it and the color stayed true.I have horrible allergies and I also have tear producing issues...combine these problems and there is really nothing I could wear to line my eyes-until I found  Maybelline Lineworks.  My eyes can and will at times ooze tears all day.Sometimes it looks as if I'm having a crying jag. BUT even through all this, my liner never goes anywhere! I use Ponds to take it off at night.  Easy peasy!The only thing I'm upset with is that Maybelline seems to be  dis-continuing many of the colors and while I can understand it, I don't LIKE it."
1353,1,"really nice!_This does what far costlier moisturizers do. It feels great, relieves dryness and personally, I like the scent very well, though some may not. Otherwise, you will find it serves the purpose as intended. Glad I bought it."
9282,1,"Scent too strong_I'm a long time WEN fan and regularly use cleansing conditioner, remoist, styling cream, and volumizing spray. Because of the amazing benefits of new hair growth and healthier scalp, I'll continue using this product. Nevertheless, I find the scent strong and annoying. As long as I apply it an hour before bedtime to allow the scent to dissipate, it should be ok in the future. Everyone knows rosemary stimulates hair growth by increasing circulation to the scalp. It has other herbal and hair/scalp beneficial oils.  If I can't get over the smell issue, I'll make my own similar blend sans artificial scent."
2192,1,The Best out There_I have been using this for 4 yearsthis is the best stays on until y takeoff if y have long thin lashes this is for yy wont be sorry trust meits great
5839,1,"Fabulous and long lasting_Cabron is such a great color, it's like eggplant, so purple it's almost black, not to mention fabulously matte and long lasting in one step. I love it!"
6417,0,Bottle Size_Most of my nail polish bottles are square or circular so it doesn't fit so well. I thought the bottom of the nail polish holder would have more grip.Buying this wasn't necessary.
7177,1,"Excellent variety and color_Beautiful product, lots of variety. There is a flower for every color of mani, look great with both colored french tips and solid manis."
4359,1,"Amazing Stuff!_This is my first time ordering shea butter from Amazon, and I chose the right seller. I love the amount I get for the price. I think I either got a deal or the price fluctuates, because this product was 16 dollars when I ordered it. I came back in two days and it had gone up to 26 dollars. O_oAnyway, I like the fact that it's unrefined and has it's normal smell and properties. The 5 pound bag really had a lot in it. I'm impressed because I made my hair and body batch with various oils and still have some left over to store. It was half melted when it arrived at my door, but considering that it's nearly 90 degrees and it was riding around in a hot truck, that's to be expected.The only problem I have with this product is the packaging. It was wrapped in plastic, and had another random plastic bag holding it. They should at least use a Ziploc bag or something so the shea butter won't look so sloppy and unorganized when it gets to the customer. But other than that, I will be using this seller again. Good amount for the price I paid and good quality!Check out my blog about natural hair![...]"
252,1,"It'll work, but be prepared for 'side effects.'_Over the past five years, my hair has gotten quite thin, and the difference is especially noticeable in my ponytail, which is less than half the thickness it was only five years ago.Wanting to halt the hair loss I've been experiencing, I began using Rogaine for Women a few months ago.  I haven't yet noticed any hair GROWTH (that can take many, many months), but I have noticed that my hair isn't falling out at nearly the speed it had been.  That's a very good thing!There are a few 'side effects' of the Rogaine that do bother me, but not enough to make me stop using it.I religiously apply 1 ml of solution directly to my scalp twice per day.  I generally apply it about 30 minutes after getting out of the shower/bath, so my hair is damp, but not wet.  I am careful to measure out the solution and apply it to my SCALP, not my hair.However... it still gets all over my hair and makes it ashy-looking.  My hair is dark auburn, but where I put the Rogaine is now an ashy whitish-gray.  That's definitely not a look I am trying to acquire!  And, in addition to the ashy look, it also makes my hair flat.  Very flat.  It is supposed to have the consistency of water, but it acts more like oil when it hits my scalp.I had read that Rogaine can change hair color and/or texture, and I am beginning to see that.  It seems to be making my hair much more 'wiry' than it ever has been.  I'm needing to use much more product to control my hair now that I'm using Rogaine.I'll continue use for at least another five months to see if it helps my hair actually grow/thicken, but I'm hoping the ashy look and greasy feel will be temporary!"
2120,1,"Drys Long hair FAST_This dries my extensions super fast. I have use it on my natural hair (I'm african american with coily curly hair) and it just straightens it very quickly! I do not use the combs however. The brush attachment I use for my wigs but otherwise, I just use it alone! and it's awesome!"
4805,1,I love these_I am very loyal to this product. It works incredibly well. I use this in the summer and winter. I like that I can tame oily skin without removing all the natural moisture as a cleansing wipe or face was would do.
1058,1,"LOVE IT._I have confused hair that is naturally fine and curly/wavy.  I've tried many over the counter products that all seemed to work the same. Because I have good curly hair days and bad, it takes me awhile to determine whether I like a product.  Until I found this. I've used this product in combination with Loreal Everstyle Curl Creme and I've had great results for a week straight.  Doesn't sound like much, but that is huge!  I use about 5 sprays for my fine hair and comb through with a wide tooth comb.  Then I scrunch my hair with an old soft tshirt.  After that, I apply my curl creme (sparingly, too much of anything is not a good thing with my hair!) and defuse on low/warm. I find that the less I pay attention to scrunching while defusing, the better off I am. Actually, sometimes I check my phone while blowdrying and it comes out even better weirdly enough! This product did not make my fine hair fall flat.  In fact, I notice much more volume if I concentrate first on the top/sides of my head and save the bottom for last.  It does make my hair slightly crunchy, but I wait until my hair is completely dry (since I don't blow dry all the way with the diffuser) and I just scrunch out the crunch. The curls/waves stay.  Sometimes I finish with a little hairspray....but otherwise, I love it!  As a side note, I've tried the CVS knockoff as well and that works the same way..."
6592,1,"Oh, yuck!  The dirt!  The slime!_You can see that I've been busy using my new Precision Tips Q-tips.  I've used the original Q-tips for cleaning forever 'cause they're perfect for those small spaces that you can't fit a paper towel or sponge into, but these tapered tips are even better.  I used them in my washing machine lid and the top and around the edges, especially where you add liquid bleach or whatever.  (I wet them to really clean there.)  And, of course, the kitchen sink strainers--Yuck!  Slime!  Especially if you have one of the kinds that has an opening between/in the thingie on the bottom; it's essential to have a tip that cleans that out.  And when I cleaned my computer keyboard, I saw dirt where I never saw it before.  (Nope.  Never looked, I confess.)  I removed lots of dirt and dust.  I also came across two buttons that I'd never seen before.  Hmm.  I'm afraid to experiment with them.  And then there are cosmetics and paint.  These precision tips are perfect for touch-ups.  I see there are people who clean window sills and molding with them.  They probably dust too.  Anyway, I wasn't aware of these new Q-tips until now, and I will be using them a lot!  Oh, wow, there are more useful tips than the ones on the back of the box on their website."
9547,0,Didn't work for me_I had high hopes for his product.  I was disappointed.  I used this product exactly as directed as saw noticeable difference in my hair.  I used this when my hair was just a little oily and never saw the oiliness dissipate.  This spray left my hair feeling and looking exactly the same as before I applied it. There was no extra volume.  I also did not like the smell at all.  I think I will stick to the dry product in between shampoos.
3835,1,"I like it!_The powders are very pigmented so a little goes a long way even on sparse brows.  Using the wax to seal down brow hairs makes this brow powder even more effective! This product is great for a soft brow look, i like it. Just dont use it if you have very minimal eyebrows."
5651,1,love it_im having so much fun with these dots making desing almost ever day... and love the fastthat i got them fast
402,1,"Clean and Fresh for Summer!!_This is a very pleasing scent that does last most of the day. It is fruity and clean with a strong tone so its perfect for daily use. This is great for being around people so, you smell clean, fresh and are pleasing to be around, not over powering. My favorite part is that it is not common for other men to where it so, people always ask what it is?........It's Happy!!"
2242,1,"great organizer_It's hard to tell from the picture what exactly you're getting but it's worth the mystery. I've gone through so many makeup bags, trying to find the right one. Although once everything is in this bag, it looks pretty ugly, it's still amazing. It has 4 seperate sections so i can easily divide my makeup (eyes, lips, face, brushes) and i love that it's clear so i know exactly where everything is. i cannot tell you how much this has sped up the getting ready process. it's wonderful not having to fumble through a bag anymore. I also love how much I can fit in this thing, it's really unbelievable how many palettes i keep in here. the only thing that would make this bag better for me would be if there was a handle. but i highly recommend it, it's not that expensive as far as makeup bags go so even if you dont love it like me, its not a big waste of cash."
8646,1,"This is fabulous stuff!_I was skeptical about this product that was recommended by a friend, but use it every time I wash my hair.  I hardly have to usea flat iron anymore; just blow drying my fine somewhat wavy hair after applying this makes it really smooth.  It's amazing stuff.After I towel dry my hair I put about a quarter size in my hands and rub my hands together then apply all over and comb through.I also spray in my usual It's a 10 leave in keratin mist, but that is more for conditioning and has no effect on the product.My hair is in such good condition and growing faster simply because I am not experiencing the breakage from so much flat iron use.  I've cut that down by 90%.  Would highly recommend.  It's reasonably priced too,"
438,1,"Has become a regular in my beauty regime_Initially I began but putting this on my face after washing it. I must say that it can't be used alone. The product dries (not absorbs) pretty quick but after a minute it feels like my face has a mask on it and it looks like my skin is peeling. I put my regular moisturizer ( which is olive squalene or shea butter) over it and everything was fine.I've been using the product on my face and now my body for more than 2 months and I'm on my second bottle and its really working. My skin heals faster from acne scarring and hyperpigmentation  , it prevents my skin from getting aggravated if i use something harsh on my skin, and it doesn't aggravate my eczema (but it does not prevent it flare ups from other factors). I also must say that since i've been using the product my eyebrows, eyelashes, and some other unwanted facial hair grows back a little faster... its slightly annoying but not enough to stop me from using the product.Other random things about the product... I don't refrigerate it and it lasts. It also mixes well with oils and natural moisturizers but if you use it/mix it with lotions that are thin (not creamy and absorb quickly) i find that some of the flaking will still occur.I would recommend this product but you have to use it under a compatible moisturizer."
9166,1,"Son's acne is cured finally_My teenage son finally has one product to put on, after washing with Basis liquid soap, that keeps his acne in check. Poor thing, I wish I had found this sooner. It really works on reducing inflammation and pimples."
1028,1,"Grreat for color treated hair_My aunt uses it all the time -- so I got some to stock her up,  Only issue was that one (of 2) lid came lose and a lot spilled out"
2653,1,Love this polish remover._This polish remover is great and I love that it has a self-dispensing container. It really makes it easy to use. :) Also has a great smell.
1130,1,"Really Nice!_This is a really nice color. I have a deep coloring with red undertones, so it's perfect for me..I hope this helps.."
3193,1,"Great bands_I use them when I ride my horse without helmet and they stay on place, hold hair back and don't squeeze my had, so great stuff"
4216,1,Wired Looking_I got this in the mail today and it looked really nasty I was kinda scared to touch it but any way I did and took a nice size chuck out of it and made some liquid soap for my face I used it for the first time a few hours ago and it was pretty nice for me it dried me out a little bit but a lot of face soaps do that to my face but other then that it was all good I won't have to buy any face soap for a long long time Great buy
8962,1,LOVE!_Beautiful color. goes on really nice and smooth. I have it on my nails as we speak! I have had so many compliments on the color!
1312,1,"Have been using it for about 3 weeks now...._This lotion goes on nice, without greasy residue. It has a nice light scent (maybe a bit too sweet for me). The feel of moisture lasts a long time. My dryness has improved. I even use a little bit on my face.I have not experienced any &#34;kind of firming of the skin&#34;.However:I highly recommend it."
6345,1,Super fun._I love this wig its perfect for nights out! super fun! I havent worn it out and about during the day for the fact that it does look a bit fake. So i usually wear it for nights out on the town.
7178,1,"super tiny_super tiny, super cute. these are hard to make out... because of their size. super cute tho.  great for nails. will order again."
3117,1,"I got complimented on how straight my hair looked!_My hair is very frizzy and non-cooperative, so when my sister-in-law remarked how great my hair looked, I was confused for a second, but then remembered I had been using this conditioner! So I am giving credit to Nexxus, since nothing else had changed about my hair routine. Thank you, Nexxus!"
881,1,mattifies_does what it is said to do.after u av applied ur makeup and the T-zones start getting shine just dab a little on ur T-zone and u r looking all fresh again.its not heavy
9978,1,"A Must Have!!_I really really love everything about this soap, from the way it leaves my skin soft and moisturized to the wonderful smell of it. I am always looking for soap that not only cleans my skin but also leaves it soft, hydrated and doesn't leave a film on my skin. The product met all my requirements! I love feeling like I am treating my skin with spa quality products. The more I learn about Dead Sea minerals the more love this product! I love the fact that Dead Sea salt contains 21 minerals key minerals for skin health and beauty. A must have!Disclosure: I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion."
8140,0,"Scent may cause an allergic reaction_I've heard wonderful things about this product and was pleased to have the opportunity to try it.I was very surprised when I first applied it and found that it was scented. I checked the package and it doesn't say that it's scented, but, or course, it doesn't say it is unscented either. Within a few minutes of the first application I was sneezing and my nose started running. I washed my face to try to remove it and took a couple of Benadryl and that took care of the sneezing. I did try again just in case it was something else (I am a bit allergy prone) and the same thing happened. SO, if you tend to be allergic to scented things, this might be a problem for you. I have this problem with some scented hair products (especially Aveda products) so I usually avoid scented hair and facial products.Aside from that, I liked the pump as it really dispensed just the right amount. It felt a little heavy but probably would have been a good moisturizer if I had left it on. I guess I'll never know."
8164,1,"Good results and very bad smell LOL_OK. I have the curlformer package (long and extra wide) by HairFlair and there are some differences I want to point out in comparison with these ones:1. I'm supposing this curlformers are stiffer because they form tighter curls. Anyways, the plastic from the other ones is softer and more manageable.2. They work! Exaclty as the ones from HairFlair. You get pretty tight curls and I would recommend to put this on and sleep with them, though I guaranty you won't have a tight sleep. They are soooo uncomfortable.3. They smell pretty bad. They have a cheap plastic smell and that smell kind of stays in your hair. So I would recommend to wash them and let them dry out before putting them on.4. The hook that comes with this package is cheap. I would highly recommend to buy the HairFlair hook, since it's easier to pass through the curlformer.5. Watch you eyes! I had a couple of hits when passing the hair through the curlformer, since they are spirals they tend to bounce, so just be careful :)Overall, I would say, don't buy the HairFlair curlformers but only the hook. Be patient, putting these on took me some hair pulling and pain but practice made it simpler."
9856,1,"Great Organic Argan Oil_I received this product to review. When I started to use this oil the first thing that I did was to smell the product itself. Some Argan Oils, have much to be desired when it comes to fragrance. This oil does have a little smell to it that is of a very subtle fragrance.I have used this product on my hair, skin and nails and so far after five days of use, I found my skin and hair so soft! I did learn that one drop of Argan oil on your hair is plenty. This product comes in a 4oz bottle so it would last you some time. I tend to use argan oil after I shave my legs, so I decided to try this brand out. It worked perfectly. I had no breakouts, what so ever. My legs felt moisturized!I would recommend this product! I feel that it is a great quality."
3419,1,"Loved It!_I have oily facial skin with dry patches as well as dead skin buildup in certain areas. This works amazing with a face scrubber to not strip the skin of it's natural oils, yet gets the over oil production gone. It reduces the dead skin buildup with no problem.This bar of soap lathers up quite perfectly, I have to say. I have used it on my face all week and it works spectacularly because it doesn't dry my skin out like some other facial soaps I've tried.So far, it seems to be brightening up my complexion and emptying and unclogging my pores as far as I can see. It seems to be clearing out the few small zits I had, which is a plus. It also seemed to reduce the redness around the zit so it was easier to cover-up with concealer.The hardest part about hiding zits is the redness. It still shows up underneath concealers unless you use a huge glob of it. When the redness is reduced, it seems to be SO much better.You do not keep this on your face for an extended amount of time. You wash and rinse, simple as that. Some cleansers stay on for awhile for 3-5 minutes. Not this. If you leave it on, it may cause dryness. It works best when used like a regular facial soap.I let my mom try this out as well, and she also liked how it worked. I let her use it because we have different skin types. Where I have oily skin and dead skin built up in areas, she has dry skin and very sensitive skin. So, if she could use it without it breaking her out or giving her redness, I knew it was a go-to product.She loved it. She had recently been going to the tanning bed and was looking for something to rid her of some dryness she was getting on her nose. Her nose was peeling (not from the tanning bed) but just because she has dry skin. She tried a ton of other stuff to try and get rid of this and nothing was working. When I let her test this out, within 2-3 uses the dry skin and redness on her nose was absolutely gone.She was even putting moisturizers and lotions on it and it wasn't helping. She was even trying to cover it up with makeup, but it was making her makeup peel off. She raved about this soap. It works AND smells AMAZING."
1266,1,L'oreal Serie Expert Vitamino Color Shampoo_I absolutely LOOOOOOOOVE this shampoo!  It is very gentle on my thinning hair.  I also love that it does not strip the Natural (vegitable based/herbal) hair color I use.  In addition it smells great!  All around a great shampoo. I recommend the conditioner that is the same brand but comes in a 'Yellow' container instead of the Pink like this shampoo. Sorry not in my shower right now and cannot remember the exact type.  It's for hair that is damaged.  Hope this helps.
8249,1,"AMAZING!_In just 3 days time, I could start to see a big difference. In a weeks time the difference was simply AMAZING! By simply applying a light layer to my freshly washed face at bedtime, my face began to even out color, lose some fine lines and look years younger. I had friends and family remark at how young and radiant I was looking!"
4078,1,"Oh how I love this primer!_This primer makes my face feel like silk. It is so nice to apply tinted moisturizer or BB cream over it, but I have also worn it alone. It just makes everything on my face smoother--it smooths over pores, any lines and creases, and even makes blemishes easier to conceal. I only need to use a very small amount, just a little more than the size of a pea for my whole face, so a tube usually lasts me a couple of months. I am not sure how well it would work with oily skin. I have combination skin with some dryness, and it is perfect for my complexion."
1230,1,"Nice and easy fitting system, though a bit uncomfortable_Pros:- The system which is used to custom fit these to your teeth is simple. If done right they will fit snugly on the teeth and look pretty cool. If you mess up there's plenty of extra solution to retry.Cons:- Even with proper fitting these fangs can get uncomfortable after a while. I found my gums to be a bit irritated as well as my cheeks. It's nothing close to excruciating or anything, just a bit uncomfortable; it just depend on how dedicated you are to your look!**Overall these are a good product. Fun."
1912,1,"Cerave Moisturizer_I love this moisturizer!  I use it along with the hydrating cleanser.  It immediately moisturizes my skin and leaves it feeling fresh, smooth, soothed, and calm. It never irritates my skin.  It makes my skin feel wonderful.  I use it along with the medications my Doctor has prescribed for me.  It has never harmed my skin in any way. It works great on sensitive skin with execema and acne!"
2290,1,Pretty Great_Definitely strengthens nails. Stopped my nails from peeling and breaking as often. I would recommend investing this if you have problem nails and are trying to get them to a better state.
5680,0,"Disappointed =(_I've purchased the Naughty Travel kit before and I loved it so much I decided to get this full set of brush.I purchased it in September, I was excited when I first got them, I washed them before using them and right away I started having problems with a couple of them.-Large Powder Brush: it started bleeding, i washed it a couple of times but the bleeding didn't stop. It stained my towels when I dried them.-Large Duo Fiber Brush: after washing it and drying it the black bristles would bleed through the white tip, the customer service told me to wash it with half teaspoon vinegar and water, I did but that didn't stop it from bleeding through again. So I had to toss it in the trash and use my travel size.-Large Angle Contour Brush: this was my favorite brush, it fits my cheeks for contouring and blush but it sheds like crazy! That was annoying.-Pencil Brush: this also was one of my favorite brush, but again a lot of shedding.Overall the rest of the brushes are fine, they get the job done, but I was disappointed with this set, I was so pleased with the travel kit and I thought this was one would be a better quality. I wouldn't repurchase this again."
2412,1,"Truly GREAT product_I was sceptical when this arrived. It was smaller than I thought it would be for some reason. Guess I misjudged but still VERY HAPPY I ordered this.  It is not a cream, lotion but more like a hardened product that melts on any area you put it on. I love using it on my feet and heels. 1st time use on feet made a huge difference. Very impressed. I have also used it on my face and it does make my skin softer. I also have used it on rashes and the rash cleared up right away.  I love the smell and it just feels good.  I'm now using it to see if it will heal something on my hand.  I will update on that in the future.  Arrived early and very pleased."
8610,0,Ouch!_I'm not happy with the effect this product had on my hair.  I have very long wavy hair that tangles easily.  This conditioner (used along with the same type Nexus Shampoo) left my hair feeling rough and worst of all it was extremely difficult to pull a comb through it either wet or after it dried.  It did leave my hair fuller but with lots of fly aways.  I intend to experiment by leaving more of the product in after shampooing though I'm leery of that for fear it will weight my hair down and cause limpness.
3589,0,Really........dumbest thing I ever purchased....._You get a generic hair piece to clip onto existing hair and if you don't have much hair in the front to clip the hair piece onto.....it's impossible to keep in place.  The piece also needs major trimming.I feel dumb for having bought this.  Go me........
5816,1,"ok_feels good on skin, absorbs right in -  maybe I need a little heavier cream, this is very light - does not irritate - will give it a few months before deciding if I order this again"
6352,1,"The best hair styler!_Love this stuff!!  Have tried many many products that claim to do what the KMS Hair Play does but none do it as well and it's priced right....will always use this product.  Holds all day, no stiff feeling and looks natural all the time...love it!!!"
7347,1,Sharp!!_These instruments are sharp.  Not sure if I know how to use the needle side properly.  It should have had some instructions.  The extractor side works great though.  Warning...be careful...the needle is sharp and can go deep into the skin very easily.  Great tool!
6837,1,"So far so good_This was a Christmas gift for my 22 year old daughter.  The is in the cosmetology profession.  She has used it several times, and it works pretty good.  It does exactly what she expected it to do."
1675,1,I have this along with another product that I like to_take turns using....  it works well for the ends of my hair and smells nice too.  Always put it on after shower and wrap head in a towel to let it soak in.... combs right through.... I love it!
5350,1,"the good ratings are deserved_I bought this stuff because the ratings were so stellar and it's so cheap that I figured i mind as well.  I love it.  I have very light skin and this may make it a teensy bit lighter, but it does give a really nice finish.  If you get too much, on your face it blends easily.  I also have bare minerals and i prefer elf. The only bummer is that if i have a highlighter like becca or benefit hi beam on then this sort of obscures it."
4260,1,It Hold every thing inside_Love this cap so much. My hair is long and thick and finally I found the right shower cap to hold my hair all together inside.
2548,1,Decent product_This is a nice unit when I do use it. My only two complaints are that it doesn't come with enough pins and it is hot as heck if your finger somehow touches one of the heating units.It appears to heat up in minutes and renders nice curls. I just wish it had more pins or clips included.
512,1,Open Eyes_I had previously used a similiar product from Yse Saint Laurent that's been around for a while and although that was good at highlighting Laura Mercier's has a more natural pinky tone and can be used directly on dark circles under the eyes and also above the cheek bone to deflect light. Although you have to apply it with a light hand under the eye or it can have the opposite effect and draw too much attention to the area. It imparts a very natural youthful look. It also opens up the eye and adds a pearly dewiness. It takes off a few years which is great for a not so young woman but is also nice on those who still have the bloom of youth as it will make the eyes pop out and give off a little gleam. It's not an artificial shimmmer but a radiance that flatters in every light. I use it with Laura Mercier's concealer  . I put the brightener mosltly around the eyes starting at the top of the cheek bone and ending at the temples.
6741,1,"Great for oily skin._I use this sulfur soap about once a week to give my skin a real good cleaning.  I use other products the rest of the week because if I use this every day it dries out my skin and makes it flakey.  However, I do like this product because it helps reduce breakouts."
2480,0,"Got one use out of this_This polish separated about one week after I got it. Maybe I got a bad bottle or something, but it looked horrible. Not the China Glaze quality that I expected."
9228,1,"works for fly aways but didn't give extra volume_From my wife's perspective:I have shoulder length, thin, flat, professionally colored/highlighted hair.  I was expecting a very light product because of the whip name, but it wasn't. It was thicker than a mousse, but lighter than a cream. It does have a nice texture and scent. They recommend using a walnut size amount. That may work for thicker hair. I found the more I used, the more I felt like I had a heavy hair product on my roots, even when my hair was dry. This product did not add any extra volume to my flat hair than a normal blow dry would. It does control fly away hair. Even on a second day blow out, it still kept the fly aways under control.I would recommend this product depending on your hair texture and needs. Right now it's winter where I live and the temperature has been low twenties. Which means lots of static and fly away hair. So I have been using this product, just in smaller amounts than recommended."
5592,1,lovely!_I have this matte lip cream in the color Stockholm. It is such a lovely peachy nude color. The best part is that it smells like cake! It also feels very velvety on my lips. I plan on buying more shades of this.
4690,1,"so far, so good. now just need to guts to try it!_Haven't had a chance to try this yet, still a little scared .... but as for everything else, I can't complain. Packaged nicely, with what seems to be very good instructions."
1045,1,"Good product_I like this product but found I had to use a ton to get the result I needed, thus the 4 stars. Still, compared to other lotions which didn't do what they advertised, I am happy."
2533,1,"It is a wig cap,_This is a wig cap.  It is exactly as it appears in the picture.  It fits tightly and appears to be good quality.  It's basically just hose for your head."
1682,1,"Sugared Honeycomb_Sugared Honeycomb is a great layer able scent. It's extremely sexy. Smells just likes dripping sweet, syrupy honey but settles into an almost floral skin scent. It's a must have for your perfume collection."
8235,1,GREAT NO SPILLS!!_The reason I wanted this pack of two was for different types of remover. The pump works with no problem and they hold alot at one time.
6645,1,I Like this apron_because it reminds me alot of the mac apron it has so many pockets for brushes now I don't have to search thru my case any mre for loose brushes.
4367,1,"Where's the baby scent?_This was okay, but it didn't have as much of a baby scent as the regular baby wash. I love that fresh scent when the baby just comes out of the bath tub. I also prefer to use the regular baby shampoo. It leaves a much cleaner smell to my grandson's hair."
6849,0,Junk_Granted these were only a little over $1 but the metal wire is so stiff inside them you really can't do much with them and the foam feels like it's gong to rip if you try to maneuver them into a position that might actually hold you hair.  Waste of time.  Spend some more money and get some decent ones.
4856,1,Nice Color_Upon ordering this I was expecting the polish to be black or in that close proximity but instead is a dark plum/purple color. I love the color its just not what I was expecting. Besides the color confusion the Gelish polishes are wonderful as always. Great product & would recommend to everyone.
587,1,"Keeps my hair frizz-free!_I was watching a youtube tutorial on how to keep hair healthy, manageable and shiny.  The person mentioned about this product so I purchased a small bottle just to try it out.  I just used two tiny drops of the product, rubbed it with my hands, and applied it to my above-the-shoulder-length hair.  I couldn't believe how much frizz was gone by applying just a small amount of this product to my dark brown, thick, curly hair. Every time I use this, either to wet or dry hair, my hair shines and becomes more manageable.  Did I mention about its smell?  Oh, it's so heavenly and romantic! It smells like roses--but not the annoying, but captivating, smell.  As a matter of fact, I put some product to my skin as well.  It gives me a nice subtle glow.  I have been using some hair (and skin) products.  So far, this is one of my favorites.  =)  A tip when buying this product:  Buy it here.  It's a lop cheaper than buying it from Walmart.  I find this out from experience.  ;-)"
7229,1,"Simple_I am yet to use them, but when I do I am sure I will learn to love them. I'd say it was a dollar well spent."
2807,0,"No thank you!_I have never used a Nivea lotion before so I was happy to give this one a try. I normally like lotions that are kind of thick so as soon as I pumped this into my hand I wasn't impressed. It is a pretty runny product and has a very strong floral scent (another turn off for me, I usually lean towards the fruity smelling lotions). This is something they should put on the bottle, I had assumed it was unscented. The scent lingered on my body for several hours after putting it on. The lotion does a great job of moisturizing, almost too good because it left my skin feeling damp and greasy for about an hour. In the winter time this would be a plus but with the heat and the humidity of the summer it is no good."
501,1,"Really turiffic prodct, well worth the $_After removing my acrylic nails which I've had for well over 20 years, I found myself searching for natural nail care products.  I came across this oil after seeing a 'natural nail care' video on YouTube.  The manicurist in the video highly recommended this product.  I hesitated a bit cause of the price & so I started using olive oil with pure garlic in it.  This did do a nice job.  But finally my hubby gifted me this product & let me tell you, ITS LIKE BUTTER! The difference is like night & day. The olive oil did work ok, however, I did notice that it took a while for my cuticles to absorb the oil.  However, this product is so silky & buttery that my cuticles absorb it immediately & it smells terrific. I am sold on this product.  I will most definitely continue using it, LOVE IT! I do plan on continuing to use the olive/garlic oil through the day, & this product at bedtime."
1677,1,"Great price for the shampoo._Really outstanding shampoo for the price that I paid.  If you are starting to show signs of thinning hair, you should consider this, as it has helped me maintain hair that began thinning out some time ago."
9572,1,"Get this, AND Denture cleaning tablets!_If you've never used one of these before, the idea behind it is that a slight irritation to the skin stimulates collagen, and therefore can reduce the look of skin imperfections like scars and wrinkles.Before I write another word, I have to stress that it is indeed slightly invasive, so cleanliness has got to be a priority.Denture tablets? Yes! This roller has a removeable head, you can clean it with a fizzy denture tablet. One of the things I really like about this model, as well as the company, is that they seem to be as obsessed with cleanliness as I am. The box arrived shrink wrapped, as did the unit itself. It comes with a plastic case.Anyway, to use you lightly roll across the skin in every direction, the head swivels.Then apply your facial serum and cream. And yes, it does work, at least for me. Like everything similar, you need patience, it isn't an instant fix. And it is not a dramatic difference. If it is painful, you are pressing too hard.UPDATE: A few people (ok, a grand total of 2) emailed to ask about denture tablets for non-traditional uses, so while not a direct part of this review, I'd like to share how handy those fizzy tabs can be.I hate to throw out useful things, and a dear friend passed, leaving behind a box full of Polident tabs. I started thinking, dentures are made of a material like porcelain, so I tossed a few in the toilet. So long as the loo isn't overdue for a scrub, they work great! A quick Google shows lots of other ways, I now use them to clean myEmsa Eleganza Stainless Steel 34-Ounce Insulated Carafe, which btw, I can't recommend, please see my video review for safety precautions...jeez, there I go all off track again!Back to this roller! Remove the head, place in a cup, fill with water and drop in a denture tab. After it sits, place the roller back on the handle, rinse in very hot water, and shake all the excess water off. The heat will quickly dry any remaining moisture.Hope this review helps, if not, leave a comment!"
4650,1,Veil Bare Mineral_A must for the Bare Mineral user -- it smooth out the foundation and blush.  Good product.  I love it.
3504,1,"Love the fragrance_I have been using this and other doo grow products for over a year now.  I am a caucasion female with fine, easily damaged hair.  After cleaning my hair, I apply 1-3 drops to my palms, rub them together distributing the oil to my fingertips.  I then work it into my scalp and apply the remaining oil on my palms to the ends of my hair.  It leaves my hair very soft, fragrant and tangle free.  I have finally been able to get my hair length past my shoulders.  It also leaves my hands feeling smooth and soft."
7595,1,"Want the Natural Look this BB is for You_I recently purchase this awesome BB Cream at my local grocery store under $8.00. This is my first BB and been a great experience so far. If you are looking for a BB cream to take the place of your powder or foundations this cream isn't for you.Heres what I like about the wonderful cream:* Its light, oil free and non foundation like cream.* It smooths and blends on the skin really well.* Right color for olive skin. (Probably not the best for someone who has fair skin.)* Love the natural look it gives.Only Cons I have is:* Wish the tube was bigger.* Doesn't really help with scars. (Seems to be too light to cover scars.)"
7613,1,Pretty_This is a very pretty color.  I bought it for myself but my daughter felt like she needed to use it 1st.  It's very pretty!!!!
9752,1,Great Item_It was in great shape when I received it!  And it was exactly what i needed for my collection. Thank you!
3045,1,"Nice unit_Honestly, I'm tempted to say that the Remington Airwave does what it was intended to do and leave it at that.  After all, how much can be said of a hair dryer?  If it dries your hair, it's fine, at least in my opinion.  But it does deserve a bit more attention than that.  It does come, after all, with attachments which focus the heat on sections of your hair, something I don't normally make use of.  However, for the purposes of this review, I did give them a shot, and found them a bit confusing, and difficult to affix to the dryer.  Still, if I had longer hair that needed any sort of serious styling I suspect they might come in handy.  It requires a lot of power, and might well trip a circuit breaker on a loaded line, but most decent dryers do.  There's a price for all that heat.In all honesty, I don't see why you'd ever need much more than this.  It's a decent unit and can be easily hung out of the way via a handy hook on the handle.  That clutter-busting feature alone makes it worth your consideration."
3550,1,Great for at home use_This is a deal in so many ways! If i had tried to 24 of MAC's Brushes it would cost me about 130 or more!
2610,1,Great sprayer bottle_This is just what I needed and it works great. I have a few liquid things I can put in it and it does the job!
3556,1,So Small and compact_Another great stylish brush case with so many brushes for all your needs. They are so soft.The price is so right and inexpensive for such quality.
6051,1,"Works well_I haven't used it much since I got it, but I've got no complaints. My hair is super fine so it doesn't behave well. My body's still working through to the anti-cancer after drug-hair takes a beating! This helps me provide body and allows me to control the curl/wave."
1439,1,"Smells great!!_I was kind of nervous before getting this because of the smell... I have a really good sense of smell, i mean like a dog and I dont like to smell like a fruit or like vanilla.. I like the clean smell...and this is exactly that!!! I live in Florida so I was also worried it would be too thick because thats also why i dont like other lotions and this is perfect!! I will forver buy this!!!"

9017,1,great nail stamps_These are great nail stamps. They work very well and I really like the designs. I would recommend these to others that like to do nail stamping nail art
9522,1,"good inexpensive shampoo_This shampoo lathers well, has a delicate, nice fragrance, and leaves hair soft and bouncy. It has all the usual suspects as far as ingredients go, the sort that end in  -ate (I've never quite worked out why shampoo as a simple cleanser needs the lengthy list of additives but there it is, even back-to-nature shampoos seem to have them), but I have encountered no ill effects from using this one and usually I am very happy with Suave's products, as I am with the Awapuhi Ginger and Honeysuckle."
306,0,"Overhyped and outdated design_I bought this brush based off the amazing reviews on amazon but im failing to understand why. I've had this brush for over a year and it just sits in my drawer. I have long hair with average thickness and this didn't impress me at all.Pros:Good weightComfortable handleCons:Adds staticHard to cleanNot preferred for wet hairAverage detangling abilityLackluster designI think the biggest selling point is that the brush lasts forever...well since then newer brushes have been made that imo outperform this standard design. I now use tangle teezer (also sold on amazon) and it detangles my hair without any pulling, doesn't give my added static, less hairloss, and is great on wet or dry hair!If you're looking for longevity then consider this brush but if you're looking for performance then go with tangle teezer."
6234,1,creamy_The perfect creamy white eyeliner to make your eyes pop. Super easy twist up design with a fine point. This is perfect for lining your lower lashline with to make your eyes seem bigger. No skipping or tugging and it stayed on my waterline for 12 hours WITHOUT any kind of primer. That makes it a winner in my book.
5381,1,"Very pleased with results and application_This was my first experience with at home hair coloring. Until now I had always gone to the salon and got my hair dyed but dropping $140 for color and a cut was becoming too much. I decided to give this product a try because of the easy foam application. I have an old shoulder injury and figured it would be easier than trying to apply cream for the first time.My hair is very thick and goes to the middle of my shoulder blades so I decided to get 2 boxes just in case. I'm glad I did because I used up almost both bottles. I had no problem with the foam coming out the way it should and it spread throughout my hair very easily. I had no dry spots and my hair was very saturated. I was a little scared when it was developing because it looked like it was going to turn out black but when all was said and done it was a rich, dark brown and exactly what I wanted. I was also afraid of red tones showing up but it didn't show any signs of brassy or red notes showing up even after shampooing several times. My hair didn't feel damaged or dry either.Overall I am very happy with this product. I think that results of hair dye depends on the individual. I decided to use Garnier cream dye to try something else for my second dye job and it was terrible! A pain to apply and it turned my hair a flat black color with the consistency of straw. But many people have been satisfied with the same product. I've learned that my hair does not like Garnier products and I found the cream application much harder than the foam. My shoulder was killing me by the end of it and I kept finding dry spots. I will NOT be trying the Garnier foam. Their products just don't agree with me. Even the shampoo and conditioner made my hair feel like hay.I can't wait to give my hair some time to rest and then dye it with the John Frieda foam again. I used color 3N, Deep Brown-Black and it was perfect.NOTE: I decided to dye my hair with the foam again and chose the 3VR Deep Cherry Brown color this time. Since my first experience I have cut about 4 inches off my hair and one bottle was plenty for my super thick hair that still requires 2 whole bottles of traditional cream color. I am VERY satisfied with the color that came out and have posted pictures of the outcome. It is a dark cherry brown- just like it says! Plus my hair doesn't feel damaged like when I use other products. I am definitely a loyal John Frieda Foam Colour girl from now on! Plus you can't even compare the ease of application of the foam to the traditional cream."
9049,0,"Mostly Silicone, It Smoothes the Hair at a Ridiculous Price_The first time I used this I thought it was so slippery it must have silicone in it & after reading the ingredient list, it does. I use pure Argan oil nearly every day on my hair & my face & I knew right away that this is not the '100%' stuff. Argan oil is the third ingredient in this treatment after two types of silicone.  It has a slightly heavy cheap perfume that I'm not crazy about but yes, it does smooth out the hair without making it greasy but.....so does pure Argan oil at much lower cost and without the cheap perfume scent.I personally don't like to use a lot of hair products with silicone because I find they build up & dry out my hair if used too frequently.  If you do like the effect of silicone products on your hair, it is a good idea to use a shampoo with 'sulfate' ingredients such as 'sodium lauryl sulfate' to remove the buildup.  Dimethicone is an especially non-soluble (won't wash out with water) silicone & may even take more than one wash to remove.  Sulfate shampoos can be more harsh on hair so if you are prone to damaged/dry hair, you may want to avoid those shampoos or use them occasionally to remove buildup. I could still smell this stuff in my hair after one shampoo & it was a shampoo with sodium lauryl sulfate.I won't be using this Arganesse on my face (too much silicone!) but it is OK on my hair.  I wouldn't pay $115 for it - that's crazy money for this product IMO.  A slippery glass green bottle & a velveteen bag are not worth the extra expense.  There are several Argan hair treatments with similar ingredients for a lot less money.  This is a 'good' product at a ridiculous price.I also do not like that there is a built-in donation for every bottle you purchase. I prefer to decide where I donate my money.  'Arganesse donates $10 for every bottle purchased to Christian Foundation for Children and Ageing ([...]  That is not currently mentioned here on Amazon & you have to go several clicks in to the Arganesse website to find this info.  CFCAUSA may be a fine organization (I really do not know) but I find it very misleading that it is not mentioned on the packaging or on Amazon's page.  This should be stated clearly.Ingredients are listed on the box (not the bottle):Cyclopentasioxane, Dimethicone, Argana Spinosa Kernel Oil (Argan), Tocopheral Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), FragranceSo what are some of these ingredients?-Cyclopentasioxane: This is silicone in liquid form. Evaporates so doesn't weigh down hair or leave a 'greasy' feel.-Dimethicone:  A silicone-based polymer that provides smoothness.  Can cause acne breakouts in some people.-Tocopheral Acetate:  A form of Vitamin E that is more stable.Update 10/22/2013:  The stinky perfume in this finally got to me - it stunk up the room even with the cap on.  When my husband walked in & asked 'what is that stinky perfume smell?', I tossed it in the trash.  Besides, after using it 2 times, I couldn't bring myself to put that stink back in my hair.If you like silicone smoothers, I would suggest either of these (you can always buy 100% pure Argan oil & add the amount you want):John Frieda Frizz-Ease Sheer Solutions Control, 2 OuncePantene Pro-V Heat Shield Heat Potion Serum 50 Ml, 1.7-Ounce"
843,1,"BEST I have EVER had!!!_I'm very picky when it comes to fragrances and smells in general. This was such a successful buy. The smell is not too strong, it is so pleasant. It has a citrus flavor to it, which I like a lot. I had this years ago and have never seen/smelled a better one, so I'm going to buy it again. Plus, the bottle that it comes in is so unique."
9393,1,"Makes your skin feel GREAT!_This product is very easy to use every day, all you do is rub it into your skin (make sure your face is clean first) and you only need a few drops to get the job done :)I have very oily skin and lots of acne.  After using this product my skin feels great and my acne has been lessened after just a few days of use!This is a very fresh-smelling product, you can smell the citrus which I personally LOVE!  No pain or burning during application occurred.  The serum itself is a milky white smooth and silky liquid.  You just pull out the applicator, drip some of your finger and rub it into your face!  Couldn't be easier to apply and takes less than a minute to do.  Best time to do it is morning after your shower or evening after washing off the makeup :)With sensitive skin it is very hard to find a product that works, actually nothing has worked like the Vitamin C Serum.I promise you won't be disappointed in this product, it is not extremely expensive which is great for most people, and it is easy to get at Amazon!***I received a complimentary product in exchange for an open and honest review - no other compensation was received***"
2085,1,"Great stuff_We all know how good vit. C is for the skin but with most products made with vit C in it, in a short time you will notice the Vit C will start to oxidize in the lotion and start to turn it orange. With this product you can apply this to the lotion that you put in your hand just before you apply it to your body. You get a fresh dose of vit C to your skin each time. Yes you do have to mix it in your palm with your fingers but a small price to pay for the benefits to the skin. I have noticed some firming and toneing effects to the skin on my legs, arms and hands. Improved texture as well."
5026,1,"It works but it isn't magic_So I got this instead of waiting to save up for a clarisonic, so I can't compare this to a clarisonic.However, I like it.  It leaves my skin clean and soft, has cleared up my blackheads pretty well on my nose and in the corners of my nose.I do not like the cleanser it comes with AT ALL.  I use Burt's Bees cream cleanser, the chamomile bark one.  I think a cream cleanser works really well with this product because the nature of the device is to exfoliate and the cream cleanser can keep the skin hydrated while that is happening, but that's just a personal opinion, no medical evidence.  I have heard people using cetaphil and things like that too.If you are using this often, you are going to chew up batteries.  Invest in re-chargables.Don't overdo it, use it only 2 minutes or so and only once a day, even less if you start feeling irritated.  This is going to be different for everybody, just telling you how it is for my skin, which admittedly, is sensitive.I like that the replacement brushes are easy to find, but obviously the clarisonic has more types of brush heads to choose from.Overall, I like the product, it gets my face clean, but don't expect it to make your skin perfect overnight.Pros: Keeps skin soft, cleans out blackheads, easy to find replacement brush headsCons: chews up batteries, lack of different type brush heads, icky cleanser comes with it"

8354,1,"Lovely rainbow effect_This polish is very lovely and true to its holographic title. I've ordered China Glaze's holo in black and it has almost no rainbow effect so I tried this. It wasn't any more expensive either which is very nice. However, unfortunately it takes 3 coats or more for it to be a solid shade, at least in the silver color. I haven't tried any other colors yet. Also, it takes a VERY long time to dry. I had a lot of accidental smudges because of going to bed thinking it was dry. It does seem to have staying power though. I wore it on my toe nails for a couple weeks and it never faded or peeled. I highly recommend this brand."

If you love to curl your hair and have it STAY all day and into the next one or 2 days........spray this product on each section, curl with a curling iron, and then go on to the next section.  Once all the sections have cooled, BRUSH THROUGH the curls...YES, I said that.  These curls will beautifully.  I will never be without this again!"

3554,1,"Amazing Brushes_I got these brushes today and let me tell you, they are really great high quality, the brushes are very soft and they did not shed whenever you felt them. At first though it had a smell like most brushes do, but once you deep cleanse them there will be some hair that sheds maybe like 4 pieces, but other than that the brushes are really amazing and they feel very soft, no dyes came off after the cleanse. I recommend deep cleansing them with a brush cleaner by e.l.f or if you don't have that, you could also cleanse them with your foaming makeup cleanser/remover (cheaper)."
857,1,For mature women_The fragrance is really nice and lasts long. It is musky . Maybe its just me but i felt the perfume was more fit for a maore matured woman. I am in my late 20s and i felt the perfume would suit someone around my mm's age. And she loves me.

7776,1,"nice, but a bit bulky_This mirror has an adjustable stand. You can adjust the angle from fairly upright to about 60 degrees from the table (which is quite a steep angle. I'm not sure how that would be useful). Anyway, the mirror rotates easily. It has 1X and 5X magnification. The light has 4 different filters. The daylight one is the best. It is simply a white light. I don't really find the 3 others (office, evening, and home) useful for me.A nice feature of this mirror is that it has an electric outlet on the front of the unit.The thing that bothers me the most about this mirror is that it is rather bulky."

718,1,"THE best flat iron on the planet!_I have very thick, very hard-to-deal with hair that has a messy, random sort of wave that I hate. The Chi iron is the ONLY flat iron I've ever tried that really gets my hair looking sleek and stick-straight. (I've tried several cheaper products and the Solano Sapphire, as well.)The 1-inch model is a great size, I think, because it's so maneuverable. (The 2-inch might be a bit much unless you have a really massive amount of hair.) This baby gets HOT, so I like the smaller iron because it makes it less likely for me to burn my clumsy self when I'm doing my hair!The temperature on this isn't adjustable, but I don't find that to be a problem -- it doesn't seem overly hot to me, and I haven't noticed that it causes any damage to my hair.One caveat that others here have mentioned as well: If you buy from Amazon, the warranty won't apply. That said, the price is so much better here that unless you're REALLY hard on your hair appliances, it's probably worth it to go with Amazon anyway. (I've never had any issues with my Chi, incidentally.)"
6992,0,Not Impressed!_I am not impressed with this brush set. The bristles continuously fall out and they are very stiff. The old saying &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; is definitely true with this item. Another thing is that there are several of the same brushes. Very disappointing.
2883,1,Nothing Better_This is by far the best topcoat I have ever used.  The finish is amazing and my nails never chip.  I will use no other.
3139,1,"INCREDIBLE._This product is a gem! It smells amazing and works like a charm. We dry haired ladies so lucky it is around. I have blonde hair that is highlighted with platinum pieces and frequently styled with hot tools. This masque really re-conditions and strengthens my hair to a glory its never known, even when it was virgin. And boy does it shine! People have stopped to ask me how I got my hair so shiny and soft.  I definitely recommend this product."
2231,1,"This is now a summer staple_I have white skin and tan easily except my legs. I have a little Indian in me and so I am a white girl with dark hair and eyes. I thought this product was not harsh or orangish. I liked the color it made my skin, but the whole less is more concept applies here. Do Not smother your legs or you will look like a Dorito."
7555,1,"Gorgeous professional looking manicure at home!_I've been getting my nails done for years (usually acrylic) but my manicurist turned me onto gel polish and I loved it! Gel polish stays looking newer for a longer period of time because it keeps its shine. My acrylic could last for weeks if not for the surface polish (regular nail polish) that will have chipped or dulled in less than 2 weeks. With the gel polish over acrylic I could go much longer without a fill because my nails still look new and shiny even after 3+ weeks of nail growth.Though I haven't gotten acrylic lately I still enjoy polishing my nails at home. Polish usually lasts about 5-7 days for me depending on how much effort I put into prep work and the type of polish I use. I first saw this kit at Walmart and thought it was too expensive to try. Finally saw it at CVS instead with a $10 off coupon next to it recently and bought the kit. It came out to something like $40.Upon opening box I was pretty impressed with the UV lamp - it looked high quality. I was less impressed with the other tiny, tiny, bottles of gel cleanser, base/top coat, gel color, and primer. It would have been nice to have larger bottles of product. The instructions were LONG. Not that any of it was complicated, but there were a lot of steps involved. Half of these steps I already do when I put regular polish on anyway. (File, clean, etc.) No big deal really. It's helpful that they give you a summarized reference card in addition to detailed instructions so you don't have to read the long instructions over and over again.The process:1. I took my old polish off using regular remover and cotton. This will prove to be a huge no-no later with the lint from cotton.2. Using their lint free wipe, clean nails with 'Gel Cleanser'.3. Applied 'Gel Primer' to nail in a circle (though I did a box shape) around my nails. Air Dry.4. Apply thin layer of 'Base/Top Coat'. This is clear so I couldn't tell whether I was applying thin or not. At this point I notice little fuzzies  everywhere on my nails from cotton earlier. Doh! Oh well, must keep polishing! Cure for 30 seconds...the lamp beeps after 30 seconds and turns off after 60 seconds.5. Apply thin layer of 'Color Gel Polish'. As I am doing this I accidentally swiped my other hand with cured base coat against my sweater sleeve. Not only do instructions not tell you that curing doesn't set your base/top coat but your nail surfaces are quite sticky right now and you have to be very careful. Grrr..More fuzzies all over my nails. Must continue color gel polish. Cure for 60 seconds.6. Repeat with second coat of 'Color Gel Polish' and cure for 60 seconds. The fuzzies are annoying me but thankfully since my nails are not set I am able to remove some of them as I am applying polish. At this point nails are still super, super tacky. Stay away from dirt, lint, everything!7. Finally, apply one more thin coat of 'Base/Top Coat' and cure for 30 more seconds.8. Take the lint free wipe, put some 'Gel Cleanser' on it and wipe it over surface of nails. This takes away that tacky/sticky layer. Viola! Done!Pros:- Gorgeous, mirror like shine, gel manicure that looks incredibly professional. Shines like crazy.- No strong odors at all. I was surprised that it barely had any. No odors on nails after either.- I figured out during process that if lint sticks to polish after curing you can clean it up with the 'Gel Cleanser' and continue on to next step of polishing. It turns out that the polish IS set underneath the sticky layer on top and you can just wipe it away with the cleanser.- Polish color has depth, no streaks at all.- Read instructions once and just referred to reference card afterwards. Pretty easy.- Nice UV lamp.- Though it seems like long process, it's not. Remember you are not curing each finger, you are curing one hand at a time (minus the thumbs).- Save money in long run (maybe not time because of removal).Cons:- Probably should have mentioned in instructions that your nail surfaces will be sticky through entire process until last step.- Not much product in kit.- Price is sort of high. Bottles of polish cost around $10. Refill kits I think are slightly higher or around same price.- Removal time and effort is expected to be high. It's a given whether you get acrylic, brush on gel, etc. I have not tried a product that did not require the use of a Dremel, literally, to take the manicure off. If this is a concern of yours, you could still purchase this kit and do a clear gel overlay on your nails instead. Let your nails grow out or do your own fills.- Not good for people that like to switch colors often.- And last, the whole UV lamp thing does concern me. Is it dangerous to be using this thing?Conclusion:Though I'm dreading the removal part because I've had to go through similar process with brush on gel before, I am overall very satisfied with the outcome. It's my first time using this and my nails came out great despite the couple of snafus. I still have fuzzies in my nails but you can't even tell because it's so ridiculously shiny. I'll upload a picture for everyone.***Follow up 7/25/12I am still a VERY happy user of this gel kit. I just wanted to update on removal methods (and it's really not that bad!)Pure acetone soak:I went and purchased pure acetone from the beauty shop (it comes in plastic bottle in different sizes). Poured some into a glass bowl and soaked for 10 minutes. (This is after I had filed the shiny layer off surface of nails). After 10 minutes I noticed gel had softened on nails. Taking an orange stick I scraped the gel off one finger at a time. It was not difficult whatsoever. Your hands don't look pretty during this process. The gel doesn't come off in one piece, it sort of shaved off...like if you were to take a chocolate bar and a peeler to get some chocolate shavings lol. Even when I soaked other hand for longer I still had same experience. Some people put the bowl of acetone into another bowl of hot water. I have not tried that method yet. If you try this method make sure you have a good surface to work with and a glass bowl. I originally put it in plastic and it melted the plastic. Also the acetone can eat away at your furniture/laminate. I'm sure adding heat would have helped but I have a small apartment and not much workable space to do anything. Other reviewers seem to say that is key to easy removal.The peel off method:I know, this is not the 'prescribed' method but I just scrape it off my nails without the acetone. I found that this was less messy and since gel wasn't soft from acetone soak, came off in bigger chunks. Any remaining gel I just filed away. The traces of gel normally stick to where you had placed your primer. So don't go overboard on the primer! I have not used acetone since and I've done my nails several times since then. If your natural nails are pretty strong then you can probably get away with this method as well.The other peel off method:This is the fun one. I skipped the primer when I put the gel on. The resulting manicure looked just as good though didn't last as long. And when you are tired of your manicure all you do is peel it off each finger in one piece. It reminded me of the polish we used as children that peeled off in what looked like a layer of vinyl. It was fun but don't expect it to last weeks or anything. Great for anyone with commitment issues :)Final tip:Watch out for that primer. The more you put on, the more difficult it is to take off gel. It's like super glue.9/11/12Just a quick update. (Still loving the system btw!) They have a new tool now that looks like a scraper, costs about $5 and works GREAT in helping remove polish. Looks sort of like a mini curved spatula. I have not gone back to using the acetone at all and continue to just remove polish by scraping it off dry. With this added tool I can remove my polish in less than 10 minutes. Do use care when using the scraper not to dig in and damage natural nail! I use primer sparingly....so if your polish is not coming off easily you will need to soak your nails in pure acetone to soften if you have trouble."
4688,1,"Very nice._I use this for red spots, and acne marks. I also use it on my eyelids to even out the redness before I apply eyeshadow. The only thing I don't like, is the slight shimmer to it. It would be great if it were matte. Overall, I love it!"
2582,1,"A must for the fight against Acne_I used a very similar product in the past, Jan Marini Factor A+ lotion, w/ good results; but after time it caused more problems than it was worth.  I would get reactive pimples around my chin, so I discontinued it's use.  Six months later, acne returned b/c my skin was not turning over as quickly b/c of aging.  I have since added this to my routine, along w/ the cleanser and BP; and I am very happy w/ the quick results.  So far, no reactive pimples.  I also like this in a tube rather than pump, b/c I can control how much is dispensed.I must mention that I am not using it exactly as prescribed.  I started using the AHA at the beginning of the regimen, b/c I am already very accustom to AHA.  Prior to this I was using Jan Marini Bioglycolic wash, which I had to eliminate since that would be excessive chemical exfoliation.  I also found that applying BP prior to adding moisturizer was too irritating for me.  My current routine is first DK cleanser, then Moisturize (Decleor Iris Night Balm),  add a light layer of DK's AHA all over, then spot w/ DK's BP to trouble areas.  No irritation, only results."
8015,1,"Lasts a long time_This nail polish really did last longer than most.  I was able to get almost 2 weeks out of an application.  I'm not crazy about the color selection I made however.  The Almost Naked, looked more gray than nude.  I would like to try another bottle in a different color."
4326,1,"Thick lashes with no smudging_CoverGirl LashBlastFusion Mascara does not indicate that it's water resistant, so I was a bit concerned that I would end up with racoon eyes by the end of the day.  Well, I had nothing to worry about.  Not only does it dry quickly, but it doesn't run and comes off  easily.  The wand is chuncky and does not taper.  It's a bit odd working with it at first because the standard mascara wand gets slimmer at the end.  But, with the LashBlastFusion wand I didn't have to worry about getting poked in the eye.  I'm sold.  With this mascara, I have thick lashes that open my eyes without smearing, smudging or running.  The only problem I have now is figuring out what to do with the other two mascaras I have."
5122,1,"works great!!_I used to have really strong nails.  After a series of moving and helping friends move...it was terrible.. and left my nails chipping all the time.  I bought this after weeks of frusteration.  Its amazing!!  It makes such a difference.  I started by using it as recommended.  The bottle recommends two coats and then reapply once every 3 days.  I now use it once a week, only one coat and its just fine.  My nails haven't chipped in a long time, and they seem to be getting back to my normal strong, long nails.  For the price, its amazing!"
2852,1,"Soft skin!_I bought a 4 pack of these gloves after succumbing to itchy, flaky winter skin. When they arrived, I didn't have high hopes, but I was pleasantly surprised! The gloves are fairly rough and they take a little while to get used to, but my skin hasn't been this soft in recent memory. Even my elbows are smooth!I will continue to order these. They have solved my problem of winter skin. They do seem a little weird to others when you leave them in the shower, but they do the job of exfoliating better than any scrub I have ever used."
8851,1,"New Favorite!_I LOVE this polish! I'd compare it to China Glaze's discontinued OMG collection. I have most of them, but they are super expensive. This color is a gun-metal gray, as described in a previous review, and it has a great holo effect in sunlight and indoor light. It went on smoothly, dried quickly, no streaks, chips, or smudges. I used 2 coats, even though it looked fine with just one. Obviously the color and holo effect were more defined with the second coat. I'd highly recommend this to anyone!"
2835,0,"Just bleh_I am transitioning to natural and wear my hair in twist outs or wet sets most of the time, so I am looking for products to use now and to take me into my curly-hair when I am ready to chop off the relaxer.  I bought the 2 oz jar of this product from the beauty supply, along with the Curly Buttercreme, just to try it out.  I must comment on price, since price is one of the things I consider when buying something.  I am one of those people who is willing to pay top dollar for beauty products...if they work.  I paid $10 for this 2 oz jar, which is $5 an ounce.  That is outrageous, even for me.Now first I'd like to say - I didn't use this incorrectly.  I wasn't trying to make my hair 'look like a Jheri curl' and I didn't use half the jar at once - I followed the directions on the jar and the Miss Jessie's website.  My 2 oz jar has a small dent at the top where you can see I used the product, but the vast majority of the jar is still there, and I figure I could probably get 5-6 braid outs out of a 2 oz jar.  People shouldn't assume that just because something doesn't work for others the way it works for them, that those others must be using it wrong.  I know how to do a twist-out on my own hair.  I'm not super vigilant about product ingredients - I prefer natural products if possible but some of my favorite products do have silicone and other no-nos in them.  I'm a big proponent of 'if it works for you, then it's great.'  But the fact is Miss Jessie's uses mineral oil in the Curly Pudding, which is known to weigh down hair.  There's also silicone in this product which can give hair a slimy coating to it, especially naturally curly hair.In any case, I did a braid-out - washed my hair, then applied the pudding to sections and braided it.  I put the pudding between my palms, rubbed together, and smoothed my palms down the sections.  I do this to avoid overloading my hair with product.  I use very little because most of my hair is still relaxed so obviously it needs less product.  Then I braided, slept, the next morning unbraided slowly with a little oil on my fingers to prevent frizz.  The first day I would've given the CP four stars - my hair was shiny and beautiful-looking, but it was hard and stiff especially in the back (texture of my back is different than texture of my front).  The braid-out was well defined, more tightly curled and looked exactly how I like it.Over the course of the next week, though, my rating steadily decreased.  At night I pincurl my braid-out in big sections (I twist it around itself and then use a big bobby pin to secure) or I rebraid if I'm not too lazy.  This time I pincurled because I could tell the hold in this pudding was great.  I was right - my curls looked shiny and beautiful!  But they FELT horrible.  The second day they were dry, so I put a little Shea Moisture on them as I am wont to do.  A few hours later, it was dry again.  None of the moisturizer I used for the rest of the week did anything to make my hair moisturized again.  Even the Curly Buttercreme - actually, that was worse.  It just sat on top of my hair and made it limp and heavy.  I only put it on like two sections before I gave up on it completely.  Again - the curls were still defined, held like a champ and looked great.  But my hair felt like straw.  And even pincurling it at night didn't prevent the horrible snarls and tangles that I started getting by the third or fourth day.  My cousin touched my hair on day 5 and commented that it looked like it was locking up.  It was dry and brittle and my ends felt like they would turn to dust if I touched them too hard.I was like, I need this stuff out of my hair, so I went to find a gentle clarifying shampoo (I needed to clarify anyway but this stuff made it necessary).  When I rinsed under the water it indeed felt slimy and gross coming out of my hair.Now.  For some people Miss Jessie's really works for them and it is the best thing that ever happened to their hair.  Power to them - I'm glad they found something that works!  That's what the natural journey is all about.  For me, the facts are these:Pros:1. My hair looked shiny and pretty from the outside.2. The curl lasted for 5 days straight.Cons1. The price is too high!2. The product has ingredients that I'd rather not put in my hair.3. It made my hair stiff when I would prefer a softer hold.4. It made my hair dry and desperately thirsty.5. My hair became a tangly knotted mess.So I am still on the hunt for a twist-out/braid-out/setting creme!  And I don't think I'll be trying any more of Miss Jessie's products."
6526,1,Hair Extensions_I love the colors they are bright and very pretty ! They came lots faster than what was told ! Everything that was pictured was with the the hair extensions ! Super excited to put them in my hair later this week!
7221,1,"good job great quality.._Great Great quality items.. they are sharp and cut true right outta the box..  For the price, I'd have expected mickey mouse quality, BUT these are actually my new favorite nail trimming and upkeeping products.."
5631,1,"Four Stars_pretty color, more pink than purple but might be my skin tone too."
8680,1,Awesome product!_I love Tresemme products and this one is no exception.  The smooth infusing serum works wonders on my long thick hair.  It leaves very little residue and leaves my hair feeling super silky and replenished.  You do need to use a bit more than is recommended on the bottle but that could be because my hair is pretty long.  It's a really great restorative product and I like feeling like I'm doing something healthy for my hair.
6686,0,"Great concept in theory...but not application (pun intended)_Banana Boat is usually a safe bet for quality sunscreen product so I eagerly tried the Sport Cool Zone Spray SPF30. With very fair skin, our family is in constant need of a good sunscreen!The Pros--There is a distinct lack of sunscreen-y smell. I love that fact!-The 'Cool Zone' aspect works. It feels delicious when you first spray it on.-It seems to go far. Usually spray cans don't last us long but this one has.-The spray nozzle hasn't jammed and the bottle has been exposed to a lot of sand!The Cons--I doubt the coverage aspect. I sprayed my daughter and myself before 40 minutes in the sun and we both burned. I tried again several days later and used twice as much. Again, a burn after 1 hour. We were at the pool but according to the directions, we should have been fine.-My daughter told me it stings. She has very sensitive, eczema-prone skin and very little in sunscreens address that.I love that Banana Boat is attempting to do something different with sunscreen. I love the theory. But we need the product to remain intact."
4693,1,"Great Body Scrub!_Over the years I've played with many body care products and never really liked them or enjoyed them. That is, until I found Vivo Per Lei! I've tried time and time again to find a really good exfoliant... something that I felt got the dead skin off my body without being so abrasive I might as well have just used sandpaper. When I stumbled across this I was sold. I didn't buy it right away at the mall kiosk but I went back a few months later because it was Christmas time when they showed it to me and I didn't have the money at the time to spend on myself and this stuff at mall kiosks tends to be pretty expensive.  Used this when I got home and it's been wonderful.Now, mineral oil does not nourish the skin like other oils can and do, however mineral oil has been used for a long time to soften up and help slough off the dry dead skin in spas and baths throughout the ages, so while this isn't going to really moisturize your skin it sure will help all those dead skin cells come off which is what you want.  Follow up with a shea butter based soap or body wash and moisturize afterwards and you're good to go.  The salt is supposed to help bring blood flow to the surface of the skin to help give you that glow and healthier skin.  At least is this is what my general research of salt based body scrubs has turned up (and they were just salt scrubs in general, not anything from Vivo Per Lei or any other brand so not much in the way of bias there).My skin feels great, and exfoliating with this before shaving has given me a much smoother and closer shave than I've previously gotten.  My skin also not only feels great but it looks great.I absolutely love this stuff and use many other Vivo Per Lei products. Already after only two weeks worth of use my skin is looking younger and firmer!Tip: Buy it here on Amazon, it's MUCH cheaper than buying it from the mall kiosks or from vivopl.com. I love these products enough that I would spend the money but it's always nice to save a bundle!"
4943,1,"very handy!_Use these for make up application, removal, etc, so this has a thousand uses, and cleanup as well, there are so many things that these can be used for that I go through these quite quickly...keep them coming!"
263,1,OPI will always be my polish of choice_It is a quality brand which lasts far longer than others I have used. The colors are always fun and amazing; they stay true once applied - that I really appreciate!I recommend OPI to anyone who  wants a good nail polish which will last and look great!
5905,1,Shea Butter_I made my own whipped Shea Butter cream that turned out excellent with this Shea Butter.  How much more can I say? I purchased 1 lb. which will last a long time.  When it's gone I will order more.
4587,1,"Great for Hands_I ordered this for my face, but decided to try on my hands, since they are extremely dry.  My hands have large dry patches with scale.  After a week, the scale is gone and they are smooth. I have tried so many products and finally found one that works on my hands.  This is a good price too."
6748,1,"Great palette!_I use this palette a lot!! It has all shades for every purpose. To conceal, contour, you name it! I love the creamy consistency because it smoothes out any dry areas my face may have when I am having a bit of eczema. It is great."
7881,1,"Beatiful_This item has gorgeous color, holds extremely well and isn't too big, which is what I wanted.  Love this item."
5489,1,"great styling product for dry, color-treated Asian hair :D_I was skeptical about this product because when the ' 1st generation' spinning brush, revostylyer came out and i gave it a try, it did nothing for my hair but tangle it.  But since it had the built in spinning air and i don't have to use a blow dryer to style with at the same time, i decided to give it a try.I'm asian and I have very dried, overprocessed hair from coloring it alot, especially my ends.I like this product alot for styling.  I don't think it does a better job than my blow dryer when it comes to drying, so your hair should be about 80% dry if you want less of a hassle when working with this. This brush makes my hair very shiny and bouncy, my ends look healthy. I like how i don't have to use a curling iron b/c in the past when i did, it just made my ends look really dry and my hair frizzy. On top of that, it is great for styling bangs, something i always had trouble with b/c I can't blowdry and use a brush at the same time.OVerall, I LOVE this prodcut, it gives the wonderful convenience of wearing a new hair style everyday, you just have to experiment and practice. good luck ladies :)"
4765,1,Good flat irons_I was in the market for good flat irons. I order the Remington pearl curling wand a month ago so I decided to try the flat irons for my hair extensions. I am African- American I used the flat irons on my brazilin hair and it did a great job..however when I tried it on my cheaper 10 dollar hair it didn't do it so well .. Also I haven't tried it on my own natural hair yet but I would say if you have thick hair or course African American hair it may not work so good on it but it IS A GREAT FLAT IRON FOR BRAZILIN HAIR EXTENSIONS ..The only thing is the damn things get too hot lol so you may need to use some kind of heat protectant glove but other than that I really like this item
2337,1,"Beautiful ,Super-shiny ,rich color coverage_I hadn't used 'Cellophanes' for years and hoped this product was still the same,well it was ! Sebastian products have been synonymous with quality for years. Every single product I've used from their considerable product line has been fantastic. After noticing that the 9 bucks a box hair coloring I was using was 'frying' my hair (and not always covering the greys) I remembered Cellophanes.They work differently from other hair products in that they don't use a 'mixer' (which is almost always peroxide) Cellophane makes your hair seem thicker because it coats the hair, sealing the hair shaft and making your dry split ends disapear  leaving your hair looking SUPER SHINY.The Deep Brunette color is a very dark brown (Like strong coffee) and next time I will mix it with the CLEAR Cellophane I bought-to get a less 'intense' color . Just wash hair, towel dry (leave damp) apply AND apply heat. I wrapped my hair in Saran Wrap and used a hand blow dryer(moving it around my head for 20 minutes) and wow BLINDING shine, healthier looking hair and RICH color -what more could you want? Oh yeah 1 tube goes A LONG WAY. If you're just looking for INSANE SHINE,buy the clear. If you want a 'glaze' mix 3/4 clear with 1/4 color Cellophane.I am not a hairdresser BUT my Sister, Father , Uncle Frank, Brother-in-law and 2 cousins were! I was introduced to Cellophanes years ago. Try them ,you'll thank me !Sebastian NEW Laminates Cellophanes, Deep Brunette (Coffee Bean)"
9901,1,"Hair feels so soft and light_I was given the opportunity to try Adovia's Dead Sea Shampoo in exchange for my unbiased opinion.  To start off, I have naturally curly hair that tends to be dry and frizzy.  I am known for using heavy conditioners and styling products that really weigh down my hair.Adovia's Dead Sea Mud Shampoo forms a rich silky lather that coats every strand of hair.  I massaged it into my scalp and hair and left in on for a couple min. The shampoo has a fresh awakening type scent to it...  After rinsing the shampoo, I towel dried my hair and combed through it with my fingers as I normally do.  Instantly my hair felt so light and soft.  The shampoo removed all of the buildup in my hair from other shampoos, conditioners and treatments that I have used before.  It reminds me of a clarifying shampoo, but without the harshness. I also noticed that it dramatically reduced the frowziness of my hair.  I was able to use just a small amount of frizz serum and that was it!  No more hair sprays, gels, and crunchy over processed hair....Just light defined curls!I would recommend this shampoo for all hair types and any hair condition.  I absolutely love it!"
5774,1,Perfect foundation brush!_This is my first stippling brush and I will never go back. It applies my liquid and cream foundations so evenly and with an airbrushed look. One older foundation I thought was terrible is now my favorite because of how this brush applies it. Watch some youtube videos if you need to know how to use this type of brush!
2123,1,"This stuff really works_I wash my hair at night, spray this in, twist and pin my hair, and in the morning, I wake up with beachy waves, and very full texture.  Yay!"
7335,1,"A little darker than I wanted but great!_I knew they were browns when purchasing but seems a little dark for my complication. Really like them though. Love NYX products, wish they sold them in my area. I have the brighter pink set as well. Really love those too."
8896,1,miracle in a bottle_I love this stuff.  My hair has been filling in around the edges. I am Feeling comfortable wearing it in a ponytail.  It  looks healthier and growing longer. It is pricey but What the heck if it is working.  This is the only product that really works and I have used millions for about 17 years including expensive laser treatments.
1938,1,"I love Desert Essence Jojoba Oil but got a bad batch here_First, the label on the bottle I recieved is different from the one shown in the picture.Second, it is rancid and stinks. The color looks much darker than the old bottle I had.Third, half of the bottle had spilled out in the package.So for actual fresh Dessert Essence Jojoba Oil I give it five stars as it is awesome on skin and hair like nothing else. A few drops and you have smooth soft hair and skin.However, unfortunately, what I got here isn't the same as what I can get at the store.This seems to be old and rancid and I would have liked the photo to match what I got."
9316,0,would not recomend_The tips of tge bryshes aew pretty much dried out. I only got about 3 uses out of each. If you have even rhe skighest of dry lips. The lip stain steetls there and make you look like your bleeding. Im a mua and i got them to use for photo shoots. No one was able to wear the red. The pink is nice.
9258,1,"Good_This set are so nice but really small, the colors are the same you saw in the photoI think is ok because the price and let you know if you want to buy the normal size"
4464,0,"I will never know!_I can not express how disappointed I am with the seller of this product. I didin't even get a chance to try it, it was DESTROYED when it arrived! It didn't even have a health safety seal(gross, someone could have put their hands in it!). I wish I had just gone to Wal-Mart, which I suggest anyone interested in this product should do. Now I have to wait 4 weeks for a refund!However, from looking at the bronzer before returning it, this is what I observed:Very shimmery, great if you like a lot of shimmer.I you have oily skin, this might make it look worse.But, like I said, I will never know for sure!"
4113,1,great set_these are great little eye makeup brushed. they are a bit shorter but the perfect size for me. they are about the length of a bic pen. they are well made and work great with my new urban decay shadow pallet. My only complaint was that i did not get the rolled case with the mirror but just the zippered pouch but its ok because i purchased for the brushes anyway.
588,1,"I agree, the best shampoo ever!_Great price (better than at the salon) and the best shampoo I've ever used!  I'll never use another one."
4307,1,Great product._I've been using Estee' Lauder advanced night time eye repair for years.  It is $50 for 1/2 ounce.  I bought this little guy a couple of weeks ago and use it morning and night.  My eyes look great and I keep getting carded for wine :).  I read somewhere that argan oil was great for wrinkles/anti-aging.  I'm glad I gave it a try and what a buy at $8.99 and free shipping!!!  Goodbye Estee' Lauder.  This is also great for your hair.  I put three drops in just after I wash and three drops after I dry.  My hairdresser is getting all of her clients to start using this.
9600,1,"Lightly conditioning, easy to use_This is lightly conditioning without causing a lot of build up. It also works well as a detangling spray, and seems to help prevent frizzing for my daughter who has curly hair. My own hair is very straight and fine and it's not weighing down my hair or making it look greasy. It's lightly scented, and the scent is pleasant. I like the spray, and the size of the bottle as well.I prefer a more serious conditioner most of the time, but using this on the ends of my hair with a light traditional conditioner after shampooing seems to be a good mix for making sure the tips are conditioned without causing a lot of product build up near the roots of my hair. For winter months, I'll stick to the heavy duty products like serums and deep treatments because the winter is harsher on my hair."
963,1,"Wonderful Color, Bit of a Hassle_I use this to stain my hair, giving i don't bleach it, and the color is wonderful. On my light brown hair when left on for 2 hours with a bit of heat used, it gives a color very alike the color of Ariel's (The Little Mermaid - Lol :))bright red hair. I love this color and i'll be using it for a while.The only hassle, is giving that i am a swimmer the chlorine fades the color out fast. So i have to re-stain it quite often, and it gets EVERYWHERE. Trust me, i love this stuff to death, but my hands will be stained for a while and your shower water will be blood red with the first one or two washes.Hope this helps :)"
8077,1,"Yea!!_Watt's Beauty Moisturizing Hyaluronic Acid Advanced Skin Gel, 2.0 Ounce by Watt's Beauty is something I look forward to applying morning and night. It goes on so smoothly and easily...wet with no drag. It cools slightly and just melts into your skin effortlessly. Once it dries it feels like there is nothing on your skin, yet you feel completely hydrated and soothed.I don't have skin issues to repair; nothing to report as miraculously healed. BUT, I will say that I don't want to run out of this stuff! My face just feels fantastic!"
7023,1,"LONG LASTING - FINALLY!_I love this lip stain because, unlike other stains, it is actually LONG LASTING and having a wand makes it easier to use. The only think I wish is that the wand was more pointed but I just use a makeup brush and can detail the lining of my lips perfectly. Love the color and, did I mention, it lasts ALL DAY!!!"
8511,1,"Nice shampoo_My hair has always been a little thin and kind of just sits there.  Plus my hairline has been retreating for about a decade.  My receding hairline seems to have settled down and now I just have a bigger forehead than I did before.  But my hair is still kind of limp.So this shampoo sounded interesting.  I like the idea of having fortified hair.I've been using it for about a week now and I can't tell any difference whatsoever.  The product description says it contains calcium and caffeine, but my hair seems to be just as sleepy as ever.It's a nice shampoo though.  It has a nice masculine smell and it feels good on my head.  I'll definitely keep using it."
2707,1,"Excellent product._I'm new to using Ponds Cold Cream.  I experimented a little with the original Cold Cream, however, it's a bit too oily for me to use every night.  I still use the original on my decolette, neck, feet, etc.  I tried the Ponds Deep Cleansing Cream, and it's worlds better for my skin type.  I like to use it at night.  Usually I will leave it on for a minute, then rinse it off with warm water, and then use just a smidget more as a moisturizer.  Sometimes I'll just rub it on my face and tissue it off if I'm feeling lazy, but I don't like the way it feels on my face after that.  My only complaint is that it's not as good at removing eye makeup as the original Ponds Cold Cream, and it can irritate my eyes sometimes which the original Cold Cream did not.  Overall, it's a good product."
68,1,Love it_I love this powder. I have been using it for a couple of years now. I use it because my face is a little oily. It controls the oil pretty good.
373,1,"Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love._If you are a very fair skinned, fair haired blonde, there are not many shades to choose from which don't look garish in real light. This product is awesome. I love the shade...it's a universally flattering peachy-pink with very tiny almost imperceptible light reflecting bits (I'm afraid to say glitter because that would give the wrong impression). It's gorgeous. I also have the multi-stick also in Orgasm and it is lovely too, with a slightly more &#34;dewey&#34; look (the powder is more matte). Gorgeous color for ladies with fair skin/complexion. The picture does not do it justice. Oh, and, ummm, I'm told it actually IS named appropriately!"
3857,0,"Won't buy again._It worked okay as a contour for about 3 weeks. Okay because it's a bit too light... and I'm pasty. But after that I couldn't get anymore color out of it. I was wondering one day while trying to contour why it wasn't showing up on my face; I pressed my brush as hard as I could into the case, but nothing was transferring to my brush. I finally rubbed my fingers into it to test it, and when I took them away there was no color on them either. I was far from hitting pan so I'm not sure what happened. Waste of money."
6499,1,"Love them_I guess I was naive by the looks of the packaging because these brushes are tiny! But, I love them.  They work as they're supposed to and they are very very soft! I use the flat top brush to apply foundation. I use the slanted  brush to apply powder and the tip brushes for concealer under my eyes."
6226,1,"Love the color!_You do have to do two coats of this to get it to look right, otherwise its a bit transparent. Beautiful blue with shimmer. Looks good with Zillionaire on it. Unlike the other review, mine lasts over 3 weeks. If you follow the directions it should stay put, however I did notice that it is thicker (when applying) than the other colors."
7117,1,Works_It makes me noticeably lighter all over. It does a good job at fading spots. I like it just fine.
6425,0,Waste money_I don't what to say. Tried one and get rid of the rest of them. Totally wasting money..so disappoint! Don't buy
9990,1,"excellent for flaky areas like lower legs where you need ..._This is a heavy, scentless cream, excellent for flaky areas like lower legs where you need heavy-duty moisturizing.  A little goes a long way, too."
8190,1,"Great variety_These are wonderful for anyone that likes nail art and seeing what they can create.  There are a number of different kinds of nail art decorations, from stars to glitter to beads and confetti, making the possible combinations endless.  A must-have for anyone that enjoys creating new nail art"
3044,1,"Good hair dryer, makes some waves_The main feature of the Emi Airwave is, of course, its claimed ability of turning long, straight hair into wavy hair. Well, it just happens that someone in our household has long, straight hair and she would very much like to see how she looks with her hair wavy. This is where the Emi Airwave comes in. But, let's talk features first:- 1875 watts- 2 speeds- 3 heat settings- 'cool shot' button- long power chord (I like that)- removable and cleanable air filter- concentrator attachment- air wave attachmentAs a hair dryer it's just a dryer - 2 speeds, 3 heat settings. There's not much more to talk about other than it's a little noisy.As a wavy hair maker... the attachment creates a vortex that makes the hair spin round and round and, after use, the hair does appear a little wavier than before use. I suspect that, if used repeatedly, the wavy effect will become increasingly visible - I will post an update if the person with long, straight hair decides to repeat the treatment and report the results. As of tonight, she appears to be somewhat disappointed and there's no telling if she will try again.The good news is that, regardless of its wave-making capabilities, this is still a good hair dryer. One star goes off for it being as noisy as it is."
2987,1,"OMG it so works_I live in the desert and always have dry skin, chapped lips and dry hair.  This product works so well on my skin.  Once a day works a treat.  No more dry, ashy skin."
6297,1,Can't get enough of this lotion!_I first found out about this lotion at work. One of our executives put Bath & Bodyworks soaps and lotions in our restroom. I gave it a try and fell in love right away! It smells so good! I wouldn't say it relieves my stress but the aroma definitely does improve my mood. I liked it so much that I bought a bottle for me to use at home. Even my husband enjoys the lotion. In fact this is the only lotion I've bought that he hasn't complained that it 'stunk.'
4130,1,"GREAT product!_I LOVE this product. I have used it for years and it used to be easy to find. For some reason the local stores have apparently stopped carrying it. I was thrilled to find it here and will continue to order it for as long as it is available. I love it because it doesn't leave a film in my eyes the way so many eye makeup removers do. I wear contacts, so that is a very important feature to me. It removes every trace of eye makeup and is gentle on the delicate skin around the eye."
8691,0,Needs better packaging_I like these pads.  They are super convenient and easy and do a great job of removing my eye makeup (Urban Decay shadow and liner and Benefit mascara).  The problem I have is that the little sticker that &#34;seals&#34; the package loses it stick after a few days and the pads dry out.  It needs a container that is airtight.
3441,1,"OlayPro For Me_I recived this last night and was excited to try it.  Literally, after two uses of the deep wrinkle treatment, the lines on my forehead have diminished.  I don't know what else you can ask from a product than to work overnight.  The day lotion is light and absorbs quickly.  The night cream is rich without being overly thick and I didn't have the dry look I normally do when I woke up.  I am anxious to see the results after one month."
6490,1,"Cleanses Well_I've only tried this product once but I was please enough with it to attempt a review. I feel the cleanser cleaned my face well. It rinsed away with ease. I loved the feel of my face afterward with one exception, my face did dry out a little.  That causes me to believe that adding a moisturizer to the cleaning regimen would be wisely advised.The cleanser itself is colorless so one needs to be careful when dispensing it because it is easy to pour too much.  It only takes a little. It is odorless but if you carefully inhale deeply you can sense that hospital sterile smell, lol. Overall I like my initial use of the cleanser and if I have anything to add I will revisit this review."
802,1,"Love it, Love it, Love it_I use this every day and I get compliments every day about how my hair shines.  It does not leave any sticky feeling on my hair and it smells great.  It is a must have for all us women who love our hair to shine."
7184,1,Ivory does not irritate my skin and it rinses off well_I am glad that I bought the sixteen bars of ivory because it was cheaper buying in bulk and also because this is the best bar soap for me. I would recommend ivory soap to anyone who wants a soap that rinses off well.
9009,1,Great Stuff_This has really improved my skintone and has helped with fine line when used along with the aqua tica it has done wonders for my skin.Look forward to using other products I have not tried from this brand.
5890,0,Did not like it_Ok so first of all the pen would come out more than a tiny bit. Second problem is that it does not  'glide' on like it's supposed to . It tugs at the lid. The upside is that the color (vibrant violet) is pretty and it stays on for hours.
2555,0,Rubbish!_The price is right...no doubt about that...unfortunately these brushes are weak...the bristles are soft...the grip is good...so let's get a grip and make a stiff nail brush...!
7196,1,"Very pretty!_This color is beautiful, I am fair skinned and it looks great on me. It also works for stamping nails."
5048,1,Natureluxe Gloss Balms Anemone_I was sent a free sample as a buzz agent.  I love this gloss!  It has such a light feel and it doesn't cake or get gummy as the day goes on.  It makes might lips softer after wearing which I love!  I will be purchasing more of these gloss balms. My 18 year old already stole it from me :)
7072,1,"More amazing than I expected!_I really like this shampoo! It exceeded my expectations by a long shot. My hair is usually pretty flat and I can't get a lot of volume, I usually have to use shampoo AND conditioner because just using shampoo makes my hair look oily. Well, I tried just shampoo in this case and it really is a miracle! My hair was full, non oily, and super soft for 2 days! I can never usually pull off wearing my hair down for 2 days straight after washing the day before...but with this I was able to! I love it! I will definitely be checking out other 'It's a 10' products!"
6601,1,Nice set_This is a nice set particularly if you're just beginning to do DIY nail art.  It has a lot of duplicate brushes in it and the dotting tools are similarly sized but overall I would recommend this set
7721,1,"Close to Perfection!_While I still prefer Maybelline's Colossal Volume mascara over all others, this is definitely a close contender for second favorite! This is a new mascara for me, but so far I have been pleasantly impressed with it.One thing I will say is that the wand took some getting used to for me. This mascara comes with a flexible wand which was strange and foreign to me to begin with because I was so used to using just solid and sturdy brushes, however, once you get the hang of the flexible wand you'll be set!Just as always, Maybelline has perfectly advertised products and this is one of them. The ONLY thing I would change is how much mascara this wand picks up. Sometimes it picks up far too much, and sometimes far too little. There doesn't seem to be a happy medium with it."
1512,1,"Good for first-time peel users_I just used this peel (10 minutes) ago. I followed the instructions but left it on for almost 3 minutes instead of the recommended 1 (for initial contact). There was very little burning/sensitivity, perhaps because I have thicker skin and used to other products.I'm in my 30s and get more acne now than I did as a teenager.Oral contraceptive pills worked for me but I do not want to take them anymore for possible negative side effects.I will probably increase the time to the full 8 minutes and frequency as others have to see faster results.I kind of wish I started with a stronger concentration as funds are limited but I think this will be a good start.**UPDATE**: January 1, 2012 (Happy New Year)I used this product on a Monday (3 min.), Wednesday (7.5 min.), and Friday (7.75 min.).Today is Sunday and I am peeling much more but it's a peeling the way I used to peel when I first started using Retin-A.So, yeah, the dark spots left from pimples are lightening and I am definitely shedding old skin.I just bought a stronger concentration from Skin Obsession because I would like more intense results. I was @ a doctor's office where an employee had tried one of their peels. I am not sure what combo/concentration she had but she had dark skin patches on her cheeks. She explained how she has been peeling. It looked like a severe sunburn, I guess (never really experienced a sunburn that bad), but it looked like the peel was pretty intense and there were 'more' layers of skin being sloughed off.That is what I am looking for.With this product, for me, I just get 'light' peeling. So, if that's what you want which I think anyone who does not have too much 'skin' issues might, this is the perfect product. Maybe I'm just impatient, he he. Hope this helps."
3703,1,"Perfect size_I've searched for months for another case like this one after my previous one broke, but I was not going to pay big bucks for one. The price was right. When I travel for 7 to 14 days I'm carrying a lot of full sized products so this is perfect for my planned uses. This will be used specifically for my hair products- conditioner, shampoo bar, styler, hair accessories, oils, refresher spray, shower caps, spray bottle, etc."
7431,1,"Rinses clean, not oily_I have oily scalp and shampoos either end up leaving too much moisturizer in or too drying and gives me dull, fly away hair. I had no issues with this one. It's a cream like liquid that doesn't leave any oily after effects. Hair feels clean but not dry. I've only been using it for less than 2 weeks, but so far it's clean and clear sailing."
9146,1,"What you Sheeeeea!_Yes, I am finally hip to how great raw shea butter is, and all the great things you do with it. I mixed it with different oils and feels great on my skin and hair. I wish I'd known how easy it was to mix a long time ago I would've been enjoying the benefits of this wonderful product. It's one of the best things I ever done for my hair and body I can already see a big difference. I plan to buy more and share it with my mom and sisters. It's great for natural hair it makes it soft and easier to manage."
1609,1,Great product!_A great hand lotion. It gets heavy use at my house. I even use it on my feet! It is not too greasy & works wonders on those dry spots. It keeps everything nicely moisturized. I wash my hands alot on my job. So it gets a workout from that & our winters. Great stuff!
7159,1,"The same as cult fave TiZO3_See my review there! Perfect for oily, sweaty, sensitive skin. Perfect makeup primer, too! Lasts all day with zero creasing or whitish cast!"
5085,1,"I Love this Brush_I only use Sigma brushes because they are wonderful and they get the job done beautifully and the price is reasonable.  However, as much as I love my regular set, the Sigmax brushes are my favorite.  The Kabuki line is amazing and this brush is perfect for contouring.  Well done, Sigma."
8263,1,"Light-feeling lotion_For years I have tried to get my husband (mid-40s as of this writing) to use a daily sunscreen on his face and the back of his neck. He works in an office but goes outside to play golf and hike whenever he can, and I feel that he would benefit by a daily sunscreen. We have a running joke in our house about me not wanting him to get the 'old man neck' where the back of a man's neck is prematurely wrinkled from constantly being revealed above this shirt collar. I have never been able to persuade him to use one because he complained that every product I bought for him to try was too thick, too greasy, too heavily scented, etc. He told me he was perfectly willing to apply a sunscreen lotion every morning if after he put it on he couldn't tell it was there. I ordered this lotion from the Amazon Vine program, and after two days of use, by husband said I'd finally succeeded in finding a sunscreen that he'd be willing to apply every day. Hooray! He says it's very light and disappears into his skin as soon as he puts it on and that it leaves no film or residue that can be seen or felt on his face all day. I definitely recommend this lotion as it is the only sunscreen face lotion my husband has been willing to use after trying and rejecting too many others for me to even name."
5672,1,"Two 8oz._I was under the impression I was going to be receiving one bottle, but when I opened the package there were two 8oz. bottles. Not bad, but a surprise non the less. :P I'm pleased with it. No spills. No leaks. Happy Camper!"
8177,1,Surprised_Better  when on the nails than in the picture.  Got many complements.  I felt it was perfect for the holiday season.  Lasted a long time before chipping.
7913,1,Great_It takes a while to get homeButI like this mixd cubicsGood priceI would recommend of this item
9457,1,"Mother-In-Law loves it!_Bought as a gift for my mother-in-law as she is always complaining about various cellulite issues.  For under $20 I couldn't pass this up and I read a few of the reviews and it sounded promising.  I got it, gave it to her as a gift and she has just been raving about it non-stop.  Saying she looks 10 years younger, and feels better as a result of looking better.  Based on her results and her feedback I'd say this is a great deal!"
7272,1,Nice Array of Blues_I like the many different colors of blues in the one pack and just so everyone knows this is the mini bottles not the regular size bottles.  None the less they are pretty colors.
9284,1,"Perfect for daily use!_After using these sponges for several weeks I have been very satisfied. They are gentle enough to use daily without leaving my skin overtly red.  Each sponge lasts about a week with moderate daily usage. The 12 pack is an ok value, just plan to replace the pack quarterly. I received these sponges for reviewing purposes, I would suggest the sponges to be made slightly thicker and somewhat larger for more durability and easier use."
2902,0,"Too bulky for me_This may be nice for some people. It is full of beans (noisy), sticks out, and is pretty heavy. Just not for me, but has some comfort and there is room for ones eyes and lashes others might appreciate it but it is not really for sleep or travel. This seems like it might be for a short rest on your back.I do not recommend it, would not buy again, and I hope this helps someone."
2105,1,"Son loves and so do I_I love a man wearing this, and my son really enjoys it and says he gets a lot of 'what are you wearing' from his friends."
1072,1,night cream_murad's age balancing night cream is great! easy to use and feels wonderful on your skin. will buy it again
4052,1,cute lip gloss_It is moisturizing and adds just the right amount of dazzle for my lips. I recommend this lip gloss for a young lady or a woman too
2302,1,"So Cute!_I got this small bottle for my mom for Christmas, because she doesn't usually wear a lot of perfume.  She likes body mists, like from B&BW, but this size was perfect for her.  Unfortunately, she pulled the top off completely and took the little metal spray piece with that wide cover, but we are getting it fixed soon.  So be gentle with it!  Other than that, great size, great scent.  Love it!"
2340,1,"Good_Plain old plastic caps, and a bunch of them!  100 for 7 bucks, works for me.  I haven't had any issues with them, good quality as far as I can tell."
4154,1,"LOVE my Z-pallet!!_I took all my bulky and broken blush and eye shadow containers and depotted the metal trays by setting them on my warm straightener on a piece of wax paper to protect them. the glue gets loose and a thin knife can slide in and pop the metal trays of product out quickly. then just place them in the pallet if they are magnetic if not the pallet comes with stickers and you can place them on the back and organize them any way. Saves tons of space and time! I can't wait to get my small one for travel to take only essentials.looks great, comes in many colors, thin, light weight, durable (so far), saved me lots of space."
1981,1,I like it_I like this polish it seems to work pretty well. I ordered the red stamping polish also but it was no longer available. But I will recommend the black stamping polish
4977,1,great product_if you suffer from acne this product is amazing. it helps to dry it out without damaging your skin like harsh products. better to use a sulfer soap and then this product and has a greater effect on reducing and clearing up current acne and old ones too.
7578,1,"long lasting and excellent quality_I've been searching for the perfect lip stain for quite some time and I definitely just found it! It doesn't fade and leave behind sticky or gooey pigment like other brands I've tried (maybelline, covergirl, etc)and it has a pleasant smell and it definitely high pigment and quality color."
8702,1,"A wipe that doesn't skimp on size and is gentle on your skin_I don't know about everyone else, but I'm so tired of using wipes that feel rough, have an over-powering scent, are so saturated with cleaner that you have to wring them out before using them, and are so small that it takes two of them just to clean your face and neck. Not the case with this product.The package is stuffed with 25, 7X8' cloths that are so soft and gentle you'll find yourself going over the same area more than once because it feels so nice. There is no alcohol or other chemicals that can wind up doing more harm than good, and I just love the fact that I don't have to deal with some annoying, cloying 'fresh' scent that I'll be stuck with for hours.  Each wipe is damp enough to generously clean your face, behind your ears and all the way down your neck and chest.I've been using them on my face to remove my make-up (not eye make-up) for several days now and haven't had one episode of redness, scratchiness or any other problems my sensitive skin usually has.  Just a clean face and a very happy consumer."
2760,0,"expensive, smells, greasy & burns my skin_I reeeally don't like this moisturizer, i bought it because they quit making the one i've been using for the past 10 years & this one seemed to have similar attributes... well, i was wrong. it smells like medicated ointment, feels super greasy, took forever to rub/soak in & (i put it on after a shower, without scrubbing my face or anything, just a damp face) it burned when i put it on, leaving my face red for about an hour. tried it for 3 days just in case -- same thing every day. will not be using the rest... i'll put it in the guest bathroom i guess. what a waste of money :C back on the hunt for a good moisturizer!"
8549,0,Didn't work for me_I've used better products.  This just made my scalp and hair greasy and didn't &#34;rejuvenate&#34; my old hair at all.
9782,1,"Plesently suprised!_I received this product complementary from Influenster for my honest review. I am a lover of mascara and even if I didn't receive this mascara for free I would have purchased it. It made my lashes look so full and long it looked like I had false lashes on. Keep in mind I have long lashed to begin with, but I have NEVER used a drugstore foundation that mad my lashes look so good! If your iffy about this one I would just get it!"
502,1,Smells Amazing_I love this cuticle oil.  My manicure is not finished without it.  I also use it every day to help mosturize my cuticles.
9084,1,"...*does a little Happy dance* ! :)_Pantene Pro-V Heat Shield Heat Potion Serum 50 Ml, 1.7-OunceCategory: Hair CareMy hair fine is waist length and super thick -- I use a hair dryer (on high heat setting) and a couple of different curling irons, also on high heat, daily. Always looking for new products that will protect My valuable asset from heat damage.450 Heat Degree F ProtectionProtect: Helps shield from heat damage.Repair: Instantly transforms heat damages hair into soft, silky manageable hair.Finish: Leaves hair smooth, sleek, and shiny.With weightless heat activated oils for guilt-free stylingOkay, I'll try it! *into My Shopping Cart it goes*Notes after using Pantene Pro-V Heat Shield Heat Potion Serum, a couple of times:After the usual shampooing and conditioning, toweled dried and then combed through damp hair with wide toothed comb (cuz that's the way I roll :) ).  Directions on Pantene Pro-V Heat Shield Heat Potion Serum - pump bottle - are pretty straight forward, just dispense 2-4 squirts of product into palm, rub hands together, massage through damp hair. No tacky or greasy feeling, or funky residue left on My hair.  A light, hair-product-like scent that quickly disappeared. Easy!*gets out blow dryer and blow dries hair, using round brush, as usual*  Hair dried fast. Absolutely, No weighted down look. Hair is super soft, light weight, but not shiny -- at this point. Also, it appears that the usual brassiness, of my blonde hair, has been toned down, quite a bit. Using the curling irons really brought out the shine. If You use heat rollers (which I don't) the shine will probably be there, as well.Hair is extraordinarily Beautiful. *does a little happy dance*btw, the pump action container dispenses a very small amount, at a time, so the 1.7-Ounce container of product should last quite a while.  I used, a mere, 3 squirts of product, and that was enough for my long hair. The container is also small enough for travel.Does the Pantene Pro-V Heat Shield Heat Potion Serum sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Off to buy a few more bottles, as I don't want to ever run out! Highly Recommended! --Katharena Eiermann, 2013"
8060,1,"Great Product!_This is a super product! Easy to use, once you get the hang of it. Go to YouTube for tutorials. I did my nails and then my nieces and we love our manicures! I'm so glad I bought this!"
7735,0,"Doesn't work for me_I was really, really hoping this product would work for me. I've been using it for a few weeks now and have not noticed any difference at all around my eyes. No visibly reduced wrinkles, no firmer skin around the eye area, no help for the circles under my eyes. I do like the product is lightweight and easy to massage into the skin around the eyes."
3383,0,Bad quality_Good color selection but some of the colors are too powdery. I had some bumps on my eye after applying it.
171,1,"My favorite_I swear by this stuff for pro youth (anti aging) skin maintenance.  It moisturizes and holds its moisture better than any other lotion I have tried, and I have tried more than a few.  If you are wanting luscious skin (face and body) I highly recommend exfoliating often and using this.  It really does what it claims to and has even made my eczema patches a thing of the past."
9177,1,Love this stuff and my stretch marks are almost gone._This cream was awesome on my stretchmarks from my 2 kids that I had 18 months aparts. Worked miracles. You can almost not see them anymore. They are super light and just barely noticable anymore. Great Product.
3983,1,"LOVE THE COLORS_THE BEST NAIL ART POLISHES SOO MANY BEAUTIFUL SHADES OF COLORS TO CHOOSE FROM ONLY ONE NEGATIVE (AND THATS MINOR) NO BROWN HUES IN THEIR PALLETTE EVERYTHING ELSE IS SOOOO BOMB!!!! WILL LOVE THIS PRODUCT TO DEATH SOOO MANY COLORS SHINEY, METALLIC, SPARKLY AND MATTE!!!! A++++++"
766,1,"Dove's Deep Moisture, Nourishing Body Wash._Dove's products, as we all know, are products that contain a large amount of moisturizing agents.  This body wash is no different.The cream feels like lotion and the scent is barely noticeable.People who frequently use Dove will definitely love this product."
3412,1,"Good, Reasonably-priced Body Lotion_I am very pleased with this lotion.  I can't verify the 'mineral renewing' properties, but the lotion seems effective for keeping my skin supple and soft in this early-winter weather. I love using it on my hands as it leaves them smooth and 'silky' feeling, a sensation some may think feels greasy, (but they aren't), as well as on my body and feet, which have dry, calloused areas that I've been trying to resolve. I like the scent.  It's lighter than many other lotions and would be acceptable for a man too, in my opinion.  The effects seem to last through light washing, which is a big plus in my book.All things considered, I recommend this product if you are looking for a fair-priced body lotion that your family could use."
1283,1,"It's growing so I think it is working_I am using this daily along with taking 5,000 mg of Biotin daily and my hair seems to be growing.  My hair got fried from a hairdresser and I was trying to grow out some over-processed spikes.  I see a lot where it looks as if this is a fake product.  My seller was BEAUTY AND ACCESSORIES and it looks legit so I would recommend them."
5409,1,"One of the best darkcircle concealers!_I really love this product! Where do I begin? First, you are getting really good quality for a low price which is always a good thing! This concealer goes on really smooth and blends well, with a makeup sponge, brush or your fingers. It has a nice fresh scent to it and it works really well! I really like beauty and skincare products that multitask. This product not only hides your dark under eye circles, but it is also nourishing the skin around that delicate eye area and healing your dark circles! What more can you ask for in a product?"
6857,0,"Fake NOT snooki they put coppertone or something else in here_If you used snooki like me just got done w/one so opened this (odd had big piece clear tape over top of it) and NO this is not SNOOKI, I demand refund or reporting this, do NOT order here people serious I Warned you if you did and get what I did.This place should be banned, SCAM. Karma will get them.The Real Snooki is the Best! Order elsewhere."
8212,1,"My Wife's New Favorite Moisturizer_The Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer is a spray based system that aims at giving consumers a fast and easy way to moisturize.  I wasn't aware that the old fashioned products were so inconvenient, but my wife assures me that they in fact are!  This product goes on easily, much like a spray on sun screen does, and then has to be gently rubbed into the skin.  It leaves skin feeling softer and only leaves behind the faintest traces of a greasy or oily feeling.One thing to consider is that this moisturizer has a scent which seems to linger for a long time and as such women who wear any perfume on top of it might not like the way the combination smells.  The scent itself is pleasant, but if you're looking for something that doesn't have a lingering scent you'll want to look elsewhere.I'd give this one a try rating, especially if you're in a cold and dry climate like we are now here in Chicago.  It's easy to apply and seems to do the job of moisturizing quite well."
2427,1,"Great for Natural Hair!_This is great mixed with water for Natural hair in the Summer only for me. It keeps hair very moisturized, I have heard of people using it in conditioner as well."
1753,1,"Smoth skin ever_I have been using this product for 2-3 years already. I felt the smooth skin like baby face at the first try. But it could take some time like my sister took a few times of try during one month to feel the same. I liked the old way - with cream and sponge puff, but the cream dries if you don't finish the whole bottle in a quite short period of time. The new way - the disposable puff refills are good to use for a long time, but sometimes I have hard time because it has too much water (tried to wet with small amount of water, but didn't really work), especially when I use it lying down. This is better than the expensive spa service if you're deligent enough."
6013,1,"After 3 treatments my face is SO smooth!!_Even after the first treatment i noticed results immediately. My skin feels so so soft and clear. This machine is so easy to use and takes hardly any time to do a full face and neck treatment(5 min). I've also done it to my mom, husband and friend who all agree that their face feels great after just one go. Everyone kept making remarks over my husbands face especially, it just looked so much clearer and soft(almost a glow). Around my nose is what i love most, all those little tiny blackheads, gone. The wand has three different heads: precision for around your nose, eyebrow, areas where your skin isn't flat, the fine tip for your cheeks, forehead, neck, and a course tip for your knees or elbows. The machine has 5 different intensity settings, with each step up the suction becomes greater allowing the tip to touch more of your face. For soft, great feeling skin i highly recommend this to others.I noticed some people with sensitive skin have had problems with microdermabrasion in the reviews. so far, both my mom and husband have had great results, and they both have sensitive skin, my husband especially. he has a certain skin condition(not sure what its called) but if he gets a scratch on his skin, it turns into a welt, rather than just a plain scratch. he has had no problems with this system so far. yes your skin will flush, for sure, but that's all its been for us.UPDATE 11/4: Another month since i wrote the review above. i still love this microderm system. my face feels the smoothest it has ever felt. i do regular treatments on my mom and the results have been great. less wrinkling and clearer face. it just makes you feel so fresh and revitalized!UPDATE 3/12: I still use my Nu Brilliance Microderm System on a regular basis, i try to do it 1-2 times a week, i do forget every now and then and i can tell the differences in my complexion when i skip treatments. This had made my face so much smoother, and fresh looking. I do not know what i would do without this thing anymore. I am 100% hooked and i have had no problems, only great thing to report when it comes to this system. i recently used it on a friend. it was her first microderm treatment and it was astounding all the stuff that came out of her pores. her face looked so refreshed immediately after. the results were instant."
4788,1,"very nice_i use it almost every day is really easy, if you need one of this in your house dont think about it just get one, they easy to use and your hair will look very nice"
4461,1,"Works for thick, long hair._A lot of the vegan products I find leave a strange slimey residue.  I have very long, thick hair and this is the only product I can use that makes my hair feel smooth and silky.  I use it whenever I brush my hair, and it saves me from ripping all my hair out.  Beauty Without Cruelty has some seriously great products.  Great for Vegans and non-vegans alike!"
8555,1,"Smells Great and Leaves Skin SOFT_I am a first time Dove user. I generally avoid scented soaps because I am very sensitive to them. I usually will break out in a rash. Not so with this very pleasantly scented soap. My daughter and I love it. It goes on very cleanly and washes off nicely without leaving a sticky or slimy feeling on your skin. My eczema is not negatively affected by it (YEAH!!). It's also a great alternative to shaving cream for your legs as my daughter quickly found out.Price wise - I noticed that the 4 pack on Amazon is currently $3.99 ... so $8.00 for 8 bars of soap versus $11.79 currently for this 8 pack. I'm all about saving money!Bonus, this awesome soap comes in other scents as well. I'm going to try the nectarine and white ginger version next."
7607,1,"Great buy, fast delivery, GREAT QUALITY_I love this Shea butter.  It is a high quality butter I and use it in my homemade body butters"
8341,1,"Cleaning Goo_Axe Cooling face wash is an odd product.  It looks like hair gel, but seems to work more like a creamy face wash.  That's great, since I need something gentle to avoid rashes from shaving.  It didn't leave my skin as soft as Billy Jealousy, but it is also less expensive.  It is definitely a good product to consider for people who are prone to irritation or burns from shaving."
2224,1,Great Co-wash Product for Natural Hair_I love this product and will continue to use it on my natural hair. I love the slip and the curls are really define after my co-washs. I highly recommend this product if you are natural and need a great conditioner and it's cheap.
2245,1,"Works just as well as other C+E_This product works good and has my face looking a few years younger, like 10. I am so happy I found this. It life saver. Think you can find a cheaper option on Amazon.com somewhere. Check my other reviews."
1473,1,"I love this stuff...._I don't shampoo my hair.  I put a conditioner on my hair, work it in really good.  Then I use this shine stuff and leave it on for 5 minutes to 20 minutes then wash it out and recondition my hair.  My hair is so healthy looking and shiny.  I get non stop compliments on how shiny and healthy my hair looks.I do not color my hair anymore.  I use this stuff every time I clean my hair and it covers all my grey roots perfectly.  I love this stuff.Update:I actually don't use this as directed. I have my own way of doing it. I do not use shampoo on my hair. Every few days I take baking soda, mix it with water and let it run through my hair and massage my scalp. On a daily basis I use ORS replenishing conditioner on my hair first. Sometimes I leave it on all night and sometimes I just put it on for 15 minutes. I then rinse this stuff out of my hair and apply the John Frieda brilliant brunette to my hair focusing on the lighter spots or any grey areas. I then massage it down to my scalp. I sometimes leave the john frieda on for five minutes or sometimes an hour depending on how much time I have. I have very long hair past my waist so I don't always take the product clear to the end of my hair. I do it every once in a while but I mostly focus on the top of my head. Then after the John Frieda sits on my hair I take my shower and rinse the John Frieda out of my hair and condition my hair with Nexxus Kerafix conditioner and rinse it out. I then put Argon oil on the very tips of the end of my hair which helps when I blow dry and curl it. I have been doing this routine for a few years and my hair is the healthiest it has ever been in my life.I also do some deep conditioners on my hair with olive oil a couple times a month and a mix with cayenne pepper in it to stimulate my roots which makes my hair grow.I never get split ends. My hair hardly ever falls out and it is very soft after I blow dry it. I get tons and tons of compliments on my hair. I buy 8 bottles of this John Frieda a month through the subscribe and save which saves me $3.00 a bottle instead of ordering it only when I need it.The John Frieda will leave a slight brown stain on your head. My hair is so long that it doesn't matter to me. The stain washes out when I use the baking soda or when I use the ORS replenishing conditioner. It is not permanent.Since I have been doing this routine I have not dyed my hair once since. I use to use the 28 day one that was not permanent. My little grey hairs get highlighted and it ads a really nice color to it.The directions on the bottle say to shampoo your hair then condition your hair while your in the shower. After you rinse the conditioner you are suppose to wring out the water and then apply the John Frieda from the root to the ends and leave on for three minutes."
4717,1,"Simply the best lash glue and only one I'll use_only lash glue i rely on. lasts all day, removes easily, dries totally clear, requires very little product to work. best ever."
4110,1,"Great brush set!_I think the quality of Ecotools brushes are just amazing! I have never had a bad experience with them. They are super soft to begin with! This set also gives you all the brushes you really need for a basic eye look. It is great to travel with too! I have many brushes, but I still find I reach for the highlighter brush, crease brush, and blending brush quite often. Love this set and would definitely repurchase!"
9640,1,"Relieves Dry Skin... Awesome Product!_I recently had the opportunity to try Insta Natural&#8217;s 100% Pure Organic Moroccan Argan oil. I have heard about this oil many times in the past and have really wanted to try this product to see if it was as good as it sounded. After a few weeks of applying a few drops on my hair, skin and nails&#8230; you wouldn&#8217;t believe how great this stuff works! I have been suffering with psoriasis since I was a teenager. My real problem areas are my scalp, face and elbows. My face has pretty much cleared up with the use of my doctor prescribed medication combined with the Argan oil. My scalp feels a lot better than before. I use quite a bit of the oil on my scalp at night before bed. It really seems to help with the itching and discomfort&#8230; even throughout the following day. I am so happy to have this oil at hand. I highly recommend this product. Especially to those who suffer with psoriasis or any severe dry skin problems."
2780,1,"Nice!_Almay Smart Shade Blush, Pink is definitely a product that I will use again and again. I will tell you that I was suspicious about the product's claims, but my faith in Almay made me give it a try.Just a little bit over my foundation gave me a natural-looking healthy glow of a pinkish color that certainly blended nicely with my skin tone. The consistency of the creme is light and blends well leaving no line of demarcation. The lack of a strong scent is a bonus!I will most definitely use this product again and recommend it to anyone looking for a natural, rosy glow!"
9739,1,"Leaves Hair Clean and Manageable_Shampoo has a pleasant fragrance, very creamy lather, and is easy to use. The product will serve for months as it does not take much to do a great job of cleaning and conditioning hair.  The manufacturer claims the product has ten times the conditioner of other shampoos and testing by a female user indicates that this may well be the case.  She felt that her hair was clean, soft and easy to style after using the Suave Professionals product."
7245,0,"Doesn't work for me..._So, I bought this to even out my uneven Brown skin tone, not to Whiten or become lighter. So, I expected more of a uniform complexion. Not expecting miracles. I am on my 3rd bar of the 4 pack and so far, I haven't notice any difference in complexion at all. Not evening, brightening or smoothing the texture.  I don't know if majority of people using these products have light skin or are using bleaching cream too but this did nada for me. I read one review who said s/he leave it on for a few minutes but who has time for that? I used these with exfoliating gloves too.I do not recommend."
1862,1,"old favorite_I always use eucalan lavender for my wool, delicates, etc. The best thing about this stuff is that you don't always need to rinse it (depending on the garment). Very effective and gentle."
8154,1,"Sizzle IS NOT Comforting_I'm glad this is an option for the more daring gals willing to flat iron wet hair. The sizzling sound of the water vaporizing from my wet hair was very unsettling to me, even with the vents that channel the steam away. The Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron did deliver good shiny straight results as advertised at an economical price and in less time.My best results were on DAMP nearly dry hair. I like the easy to control temperature dial settings (1-30) to choose the correct temp for hair that's:Wet = 25 - 30Damp = 20 - 25Dry =  1 - 20This flat iron arrived just in time for the chilly weather, so there's NO excuse for a cold wet head of hair that dries with a mind of it's own. (ANY hint of dampness is an invitation for the FRIZZ PATROL.) The ridges on the tips of the flat iron make it easier for my two-handed method without burnt, crispy fingertips. I'll still rough dry my hair either by air drying or with a blow dryer to nearly dry then use this flat iron in conjunction with my favorite heat protectant spray.Cleaning the flat iron plates and handle with a damp cloth after each use keeps this hot tool in good shape ready for the next use. The only downsides I experienced were:- short swivel cord- the handle gets warmer than my other flat irons.I'd recommend this to my friends as a year-round option for flat ironing!Update: 12/4/2012 Flat ironing my damp hair using leave in conditioner makes it my hair even MORE soft and manageable!"
4455,1,"CoverGirl Primer_Thbis is a good product, the price is right and easy to use.  It looks very nice on the face."
3365,1,Good one_Smell is good and last for few hours. Please note that its a toilette spray so you can't expect more. Its a good value for money.
7392,1,"Makes my hair pretty_The 2 minor things I don't like about this wand is at the end there is a rubber tip with 2 small raised dots when for you set the wand down. When sliding your hair off the wand the raised rubber dots catch a small strip of hair, pulling it from the ring you've created. And lastly the heat dial gives you no real indication of how high or low you're setting it besides little notches. I have another tool that has the degrees on the dial ring so you know where to set it for your hair type. Other than that I love this thing! I can finally crate Hollywood-esque waves and curls in a snap. It doesn't take long to heat up and the style actually lasts. For years I have avoided curling my hair because the style would fall out within a couple hours since I have such fine hair. Not anymore with this Remington tool! I go to sleep and wake up the next day with my hair still looking great. My hair is 2-3 inches passed my collarbones so the 1-inch barrel works perfectly."
8843,1,great_got the plates for snoopy and superman image. the superman imag is great havent used the other ones yet but i dont see there being a prblem.
1788,1,beautiful and awesome_I love this dual purpose nail tool! It is perfect and since it serves multiple purposes it saves space!  The brush is just the right combo of strength and softness. I will get a lot of use out of this and would definitely recommend it to others.
2311,1,"WARNING:  Check pH level&#8230; only DROPS needed per CUP!!!_Dr Bronner's service rep said that this has a pH level of 3&#8230; which, assumed, that if the water was alkaline, this pH would be a bit higher than a 3.  Initially used ratio as per instructions - 1-2 capfuls per cup of water, assuming cup was 8oz.This was used as conditioner/ rinse for HOMEMADE SHAMPOO (1.5cups Organic Pure Virgin Coconut Milk + 1.75cups Aloe Gel) with an assumed pH level of between 4 and 6.  Turns out the combination tested (using pH strips) to be around 5.Out of curiousity, and because I wanted to truly test the pH levels, I ordered some of pH Test Strips&#8230;  WHOA!!!  The pH level for Dr B Rinse concentrate did not hit 3 at all &#8230; it was a 1!!!  Perhaps I misunderstood the rep and she meant it has a pH of 3 after it was mixed with water?  It was not!!!  Even 1 capful to 1 cup of water still had it at 1, maybe 2!!!  My water was about a 9 and adding the ratio (as per instructions) barely brought up the level.After a few tests, it turns out that only maybe about 2-3 drops of DrB Rinse + 8 oz water brings the pH level to a 3.  So if the correct pH level is critical for you, use pH Test Strips to test your shampoo, water and mixes before using these!!There are plenty of reviews for the combination of Coconut Milk+Aloe Gel Shampoo followed by ACV (Apple Cider Vinegar) Rinse&#8230; many stating that it could take weeks to get the &#34;greasiness&#34; on the hair out during the &#34;transition period.&#34;  Since I was not interested in ACV, I opted for this as the rinse - similar pH.  By testing out the actual pH, and having 5 for the shampoo and 3 for the rinse, I found that the transition took only 4 days.  Hair adjusted well VERY quickly&#8230; and air drying hair was actually good.  And less falling hair - perhaps because it's naturally detangles in the shower.EXCELLENT - as long as the pH is tested."
2012,1,"Just the right color of neutral brown_The color 'blond' adds a light shade of neutral brown to my eyebrows, which are sparse and very light. I tried 'light brown' but that color is reddish and more suitable for a redhead. These pencils last a very long time and are easy to sharpen with an ordinary hand held pencils sharpener of the one that sometimes accompanies Maybelline's packaging. The price on Amazon was almost $1.00 less than at my local chain pharmacy."
3822,1,"Excellent for Medium Brown Skin_I purchased this as a concealer because I needed something that would allow me to custom blend to match my complexion.  This worked very well for me.  I'm a novice make up wearer and only wear concealer (on special occasions), mascara and lipstick or gloss.  It was very easy to blend, the formula is creamy and the package arrived exactly as advertised."
2309,1,Great shadow!_I started using Physicians Formula products because my eyes are so sensitive.  I can wear this eye shadow all day and not have the itchy eyes like when I used other shadows.
8866,1,"Turns my hair into silk._Love the adjustable settings for different types of hair. I have very long wavy thick hair. This flat iron heats up quickly and smooths out my hair easily. I have no complaints, the product performs as promised!Thanks for reading. I hope this review was helpful."
9883,0,"Updating again...Diaper Rash Cream_Reasonably priced and effective, CeraVe is a respected name in skin care.Unfortunately, I have been going back and forth with my review of this product.  Vine reviews are to be completed in a thirty day time period.  But, I was not about to try anthing new on our baby until I had 'tested the waters' personally and researched as well.Ceramides:  It appears to be a proven product and that in fact, babies are protected via their natural birth coating with 'ceramides.'Dimethicone:  In limited usage, it can relieve skin irritations quite effectively and based upon research thus far, not a hazard.Zinc oxide: Highly rated creams have up to 40% of this effective long term solution to treating diaper rash...what remains to be determined...do the ceramides in this product eliminate the necessity for so much zinc oxide?Did try the CeraVe diaper rash cream on our adult family member's skin complaints and it did relieve and help.Most recently tried it on another adult who had teary eyes due to allergy causing irritation on the skin UNDER the eye, NOT IN THE EYE.  The CeraVe Diaper Rash Cream relieved the irritation.  In both cases, repeated application was necessary.Ultimately tried for diaper rash issues...seemed to burn and was not effective.  Creams with 40% zinc oxide performed the best."
8789,1,"love this for my blond hair:)_I love this stuff, it smells great and leaves my parched hair with shine and moisture. It keeps my blond beautiful!! I am a hair product junkie and this is one of the best conditioners for blonds! I received very quick which I like to get what I order quickly!  Its a good value because you don't need a ton of product, a little works well. I use with the leave in spray as well, they make a good team."
2249,0,Does nothing for me._I've tried this stuff twice and both times I ended up discontinuing use. It does nothing for me. I'm going back to my Proactiv. :(
4937,1,"LOOKS NATURAL, EASY TO APPLY_THESE ARE REALLY NICE LASHES FROM ARDELL. THEY LOOK NATURAL, NOT EXAGGERATED. I FOUND WALGREENS AND WALMART NOW SELL THESE AND OTHER QUALITY LASHES IN PACKS OF 10! THEY JUST RECENTLY STARTED THIS, AND IM GLAD BECAUSE IM TIRED OF BUYING THEM FOR SUCH OUTRAGEOUS PRICES--ONLY TO THROW THEM AWAY AFTER A COUPLE USES. NOW THAT THEYRE BEING SOLD IN GREATER QUANTITIES IN STORES, I WILL GO THERE FOR MY PURCHASES UNLESS THERES A BETTER DEAL ON AMAZON."
8782,1,"Definitely shimmers!_I smile when I find a little shimmer on my skin leftover from my conditioner. It's like a body lotion and conditioner all in one. I use a lot of conditioner and it really makes a difference on my dry hair. It comes out fast, which works for me since I use a lot, but I love the smell, I love how shiny my hair looks after using it, and it detangles beautifully. Very happy with this product!"
603,1,"Reduces frizz and tangles_I've been very happy with this brush. It appears to be of good quality, and the natural wood bristles seem to reduce both frizz and tangles in my hair and my daughters."
2813,1,"Good moisturizer, but broke me out._I am an avid user of the blue nivea creme. I've been using it for several years and have used up industrial sized tubs of it too many times to count. During the summer I've found it's sometimes a little heavy in my T-zone so I wanted to give this a shot. I love the texture and smell. It absorbs much faster and is a lighter weight cream. But here's the strange part, while the blue nivea, which is heavier and thicker, never ever broke me out, this one did. Weird. It's still a great moisturizer and I like to use it on my hands and such."
3770,0,"Not impressed; powdery, poor pigmentation & texture_Really disappointed with these shadow palettes. I bought 3 and never use any of them. I wouldn't buy them again at any price. They're powdery, dont wear well even with a primer or cream shadow base. I'm basing this review on my extensive experience with eye products. I own many palettes and singles, from high end to low end. These are, by far, some of the WORST products I've ever tried.Disappointing & surprising as I own other NYX products - like their eye shadow singles, jumbo eye shadow pencils, powder blushes & cream blushes - and love them. These are just rubbish compared to their other products. Pure junk. What a waste of money."
5365,1,"Dri Sweat vs other bands..._I'll admit, I bought this locally (b/c of the shipping) after reading the reviews.I'm not happy with any of the headbands I have and have been working out at least 5 days a week. I recently ran across a band that I can afford, but feel is too expensive for what it is (though I may eventually cave out of curiosity), and was happy to find this well reviewed alternative before I purchased it.This band works very well and my hair was only slightly damp after an hour of cardio. Highly recommended if you sweat heavily. It actually did slip a little bit by the end of an hour class, but it was barely noticeable. Much cuter than I would have thought, as well.  Still interested in the 'Save Your Do', and will update if I purchase; otherwise, will definitely be ordering multiples of the Dri Sweat here online!"
264,1,"Really Nice!_To me it looks like a very deep charcoal, but some people have commented on my manicure and noted that it does have a hint of purple. I thought so too, at first, but after a few days of looking at it I just see it as being a deep gray.I really love it though. It has all the classic trademarks of a good OPI polish. It goes on nice and smooth and dries very quickly. Two coats is what I used to get a nice even color. It looks so rich. It's edgy, but not so much as black. It's understated and eye catching. A very classy choice for someone looking for a nice dark."
2256,1,"Love, love love!!!_Love this stick! Works great!"
5364,1,"Great bargain..._This brush shampoo is a great bargain. It leaves a `fresh' scent that is o.k. for me (I am sensitive).Just don't expect this shampoo to clean all your brushes equally, as not all brushes are equal or get used the same. Depending on what you use your brush for; it may not get clean with just shampooing. If you use a brush for foundation, concealer, long-wearing cream eye shadow, primers, liners, etc., then you most likely need to dip your brush in a solvent based cleaner first, blot it on a paper towel until you 'break down' or dissolve the product on the brush. (Synthetic hair brushes are more forgiving to be used and handled this way.) Many of the new product formulations contain ingredients that are almost `water resistant', so you have to break down the product before you can get the water and shampoo to do its' job. (Note: Isopropyl Alcohol 70% works great as a solvent for the job, with the added bonus of disinfecting your brushes.)Bottom line: good product if used properly."
912,1,Excellent_i feel my face firmer after a month. I leave the mud in my face for 1 full hour and it feels very tightBenefits are excellent
5731,1,super_great product without the steep price. works just as well as the top of the line brushes. save money and buy this instead
9468,1,"Perfect hold, no flakes_I love this hair spray. It is lightly scented and feels dry the moment you spray it on. The hold is instant but easy to brush through if you need to restyle. I live in Florida and with the humidity at nearly 100 percent I was very impressed that it held completely. At the end of the day I brushed my hair out and there were no flakes which is a huge plus for me. My normal non-aerosol hair spray would always leave flakes and dry my hair out. This is a keeper for me. A little high priced but I don't have to use that much because it works so well so it will last a long time. Still, a $10 price tag would be more appropriate."
3507,1,It's ok_I felt it worked well but compared to other brands it burned much more . It did have a pleasant smell though .
4642,0,"Fake...not the original Likas_Box does not look like picture on website - the round seal on the front of the box is absent, white tape covers the words 'skin whitening' everywhere it the phrase appears on the box, soap bar is orange but dinged and smells like detergent, and the font differs from the picture shown for the 'Original' version of this product."
3522,0,Destructive_It did curl my lashes but I noticed after a while that it was pulling my eyelashes out. Lots of them. When I removed the little rubber inside I found around 20 eyelashes in there :( sad to think that this ended up making my eyelashes look even worse in the long run.
6811,1,"Great product. Great color._The texture of this product is creamy and moisturizing, but the color does last for quite some time. This particularly color is pretty much described by the name. It is a deep, highly pigmented brown red."
5019,1,"Great Cover - being discontinued_I really like the cover that this product gives, but beware, it is no longer being made. Leave it to me to love a product that is being discontinued."
9031,1,"Love this!_The Black Croc clips are very versatile...not only do they work well with thick full hair but also on fine, thin hair. Also are great for wet or dry use.  They grasp and stay in place while cutting or styling hair.  They are easy to use, don't get tangled up and are easily removed when  desired.  They don't slip, pull your hair or drop strands also while in use. They have a nice &#34;wide&#34; bite and  spring action, again showing both durability and versatility."
634,1,"You should try this product_I am very glad that I ordered Biore Deep Cleansing, I have tried so many products for my blackheads and nothing was working.but with this product you will see the deference from the first time. For better result by the Biore Warming Anti-Blackhead Cleanser, from the link below,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006RFZ98K/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc;=1Use this one first to clean you face and remove all the makeup then wash your face with hot water and dry it then wet your nose and use the biore deep cleansing pore strip.Try it once a day until you get rid of all the blackheads from your nose ."
5047,1,"Pefection._I love this lip balm. It's smooth, long lasting and just all around lovely. I think it's the perfect cross between a lip balm and a lipstick."
4585,1,"Excellent after a chemical peel_I love love this stuff, especially after having either a pixel laser peel or a chemical peel (glycolic acid 35% or salicylic acid 20%). Usually you have to use a reallllly good moisturizer after such treatments because the skin is extremely dry, tight, and temporarily injured. This stuff works so great as after these treatments and as an everyday moisturizer. Yes, I was a very afraid to use it after these procedures because it is an acid after all. However, the name really sounds more harsh then it really is; it didnt burn nor did it tingle when I used it. I also take this stuff in a vitamin pill form for skin care, and it works good on joints. It totally stopped the carpal tunnel I was developing. Anyhow, this stuff works great, and isnt too oily which is a big deal since I have VERY oily acne-prone skin (battling it since early 20s)."
6663,1,Perfect tools_These dotting tools are amazing. There are 5 different ones that have two sides. All of them are the same size on one end but on the other they are all different. They got to me fast and well packaged. Definitely recommend.
2350,1,"Great at being lint free_These nail wipes work great, they don't have any lint, but I took off a star because they tear easily."
5776,1,"Wicked Good_Love this set.  Best one to get for starting off....and I honestly think that the smaller brush (purple) is the best concealer brush ever....actually went and bought two more of them.  Good start off kit, for someone that does not want to spend too much.  Easy to clean too!"
3511,1,"Superb Acne Scrub/Mask ;-)_We have combo/oily skin so clogged pores, acne and blackheads are the enemy we fight to have smooth, clear skin. When you have teenagers with facial and body acne + me with mature acne, you go through a lot of product. This product's  active ingredient is Salicylic Acid 2% which works well for us. This IS one of the best we've used. We even use it on the Wave with a cotton round pad.To use this product as a mask... 1st - cleanse skin with soap and water THEN use this scrub. Scrubbing and sudsing as usual, DON'T RINSE YET BUT leave it stay on your face for 15 minutes... get the timer, RELAX, listen to some music, close your eyes, whatever... THEN rinse with water thoroughly. Follow the remainder of your skin care plan. When we do this in the evening, we let the skin breath overnight ... no lotion etc.This Pink Grapefruit Acne Wash Scrub is refreshing, clears acne, prevents more breakouts and softens skin. I love that it's a multi-use acne product, the SUPER Size available at Amazon for less than fifteen bucks was a plus for us!NOTE: Just don't use too many acne products at the same time, they over dry and irritate your skin and for some that actually triggers MORE acne breakouts :("
1958,0,"Skin felt like torn in pieces_I bought the clay to reduce my adult acne. I mixed it according to the instruction with water and apple vinegar. Mixing was not a problem to me unlike many other reviewers mentioned. If you use it often, just mix in more water and more vinegar than for one time and store in the fridge. The mask feels good for the first few minutes, the problem arises as soon as it starts hardening. It fractures in little pieces that are stuck to your face as the mask shrinks and the skin tries to regain its normal shape. This must create tiny cracks in the skin that hurts forever after the removal of the mask. Besides the burning sensation after the mask is off and for the next few days until the skin heals, there is acne. Deep, red, painful acne appearing all over the face. I tried this mask twice with the same results."
4425,1,"Very cleansing_I have fine hair and used the original Pantene Volumizing shampoo for years, but over time, it made my hair frizzy, dry, and more prone to shedding. This new formula is much gentler. It has a gel-like consistency, which won't weigh hair down or make it oily as a creamy formula would. This shampoo made my hair very, very clean. So clean, in fact, that I could probably drop back to shampooing it every other day instead of every day as I normally would. I can wash my hair in the morning and, 24 hours later, it still looks good, without the usual morning after oil slick.As for volumizing properties, my hair didn't go from flat to fluffy overnight, but my stylist recently complimented me on my thick hair, so maybe it's making more of a difference than I realize. My ponytail does feel a little thicker, and my hair holds a style for much longer.The only drawback to this shampoo is that it made my hair tangle more easily. I have to brush it more often during the day. So if you are going to try this shampoo, you should definitely purchase the matching conditioner to keep the tangles at bay.Overall, I'd say I am satisfied with this shampoo. It offers great cleansing, a mild floral scent, and modest volumizing properties. For those who say that it is too expensive, you can easily buy an off brand version of this at just about any grocery or superstore for about two and a half dollars a bottle."
1573,0,"Not Worth It!_I found this cream to be heavy on my skin, and I have yet to notice any results, although I have not used it the full six weeks. The jar is small; 1 ounce.  The first ingredient in this product is water, the second is Sesame Oil.  I think I'll be sticking to my favorite of face creams, Olay Pro X."
1434,1,"Cover Girl Mascara_I received this product in its original pkg. and in a very short amt. of time.If you are a Cover Girl customer, I would recommend this Seller.My only minor footnote:  I believe it is a wee bit misleading showing 2 imageswhich might lead you to believe it is 2 for 1.  One pic of the item would suffice,in my opinion."
1882,1,Love this stuff_I have used this product for years and love it. People compliment me all the time on what pretty skin I have and I have to admit it's my Jane Iredale loose powder. Great price and love the fast shipping.
958,1,"Very Fine Instrument_OK, when it comes to certain things, I am really picky. And the personal grooming tools I use have got to be high quality and sharp. I don't like cutting toenails anyway, but when I have to do it, I want my clipper to be comfortable in my hand and above all, the blades must be sharp and properly aligned. Nothing is worse than a clipper for your hands or your toes that break the nail instead of cutting it. Treat these tools with care and don't leave them out where your kids will rip them off. It seems like every time I spend a small fortune on these types of tools, my daughters come over and when I need them, they have walked off all by themselves. So now, I buy really good quality grooming tools such as these and keep them where my kids don't know where they are at.These clippers are great, the blades are so sharp it takes no effort to cut through any nail needing cut. The handles fit my big hands and don't slip out while trying to use them. If you are anything like me, spend the bucks and buy a good set of nail clippers and then guard them from getting up and walking away. These will last for a long time if you take good care of them."
5572,1,"Love the Product - Adds Golden Shimmer_I'm new to soak off nails and have tried the Shellac and the various gel products.  Like the Shellac best as it seems to last longer.  I go in the pool a lot and this doesn't start peeling away as easily.  This color is like a transparent gold color.  It can be used alone to give a golden shimmer to the nail, or over two coats of an opaque color to give a golden shimmer to the color."
7249,1,"The same as the Vanilla Spice_I really love these Tree Hut scrubs. They're moisturizing without being greasy or oily and causing your tub to become dangerously slippery; they smell crisp and pleasant and clean without being strong; the scrubbing particles are dense but are rounded so they don't scratch your skin, and they're so inexpensive for an 18 ounce jar! To be honest, I'm not overly familiar with the genuine fragrance of mangos; this actually smells lightly and pleasantly citrus-y, with maybe a tiny bit of vanilla in it. It's very nice and works so well. I'm thinking that now I'm going to have to buy all the other fragrances, too."
3966,0,"bad product_I don't recommend this shampoo. I had purchased loreal before and it was great product, this shampoo make our hair grassy and looks like dirty. I think it wasn't loreal inside, just a cheap shampoo. Really bad and wont buy it again."
6671,1,"Protects without making your skin feel nasty_As a pale Woman who has skin cancer in her family and lives in Florida, sunscreen is very important to me. I have tried dozens of sunscreens and this is the first sunscreen that I have ever tried that doesn't turn me into a slick, nasty, oily mess. It actually feels like regular lotion! It smells pleasant and not overly-beachy. It does gives my skin a slight shimmer, but not an oily look.I do wish the SPF was 50 instead of 30, but it has protected me just fine on my recent outings. I haven't burned at all. This is the perfect everyday body sunscreen and lotion. As for my face, I have found thatSmashbox Camera Ready BB Cream SPF 35 Lightis the only product that keeps my face clean and not oily while protecting it. With the combination of these two products, I don't have to look anymore. I can be protected all summer long without feeling gross. I definitely recommend this product."
9935,1,Great Eye Cream_I really liked this eye cream.  It helped to soften and hydrate my eyes.  I was disappointed that it was such a small size but when I used I saw that it only took a little to do the job. I do like that this is a perfect size to take with you anywhere!
6796,1,"After 46 years switched from Gillette._I've been shaving with nothing but Gillette for 46 years.  After a follicle infection my skin was very sensitive and I could only use a blade one or two times.  I was using a Gillette Pro Fusion.  But it really irratated my skin and obviously the price of blades was insane.I decided to try the Schick Hydro 5 Power really because I was desperate to not have my skin irratation last for 24 hours after shaving.  The Schick is so much better there really is no way to really compare the two.  The shave is much less irratating, the blades last longer before I need to change, the lubricant last much longer and they cost so much less.The Schick is simply in a different world, it is that much better.  Particularly if you use Schick Hydro Gel or Nivea Shaving cream."
3330,1,"Highly reccommend for sensitive and acne prone skin_I have very sensitive and acne prone skin. This facial cleanser is very gentle. It does not foam, which initially made me wonder if I was really cleansing my skin deeply. After using this product for 5 months, I can say that it does cleanse very well. In fact, I am now more impressed with this non-foaming cleanser because my skin feels and looks more balanced. I think my previous facial routine, that included a foaming cleanser, actually dried out my face and made it out of balance, causing redness and acne. This cleanser seems to hold moisture, allowing my skin to feel more hydrated. I'm 43, live in the arid climate of CO, and have suffered daily from acne for decades. My skin has been totally clear now for about 4 months. (I'm elated.) I contribute this cleanser as one of the most significant positive contributors of my skin's healthy appearance."
7708,1,BEAUTIFUL wig!_this wig is gorgeous and exactly as shown. the fibers are awesome and it brushes easily with a wig comb or brush without tangling up. I can't believe the value of this wig for the super-duper price!
460,1,Nice gloves that work fine_I have a small hand but these work fine.  I had someone with a larger hand try them on and they stretched to easily fit those hands too.  The fingers feel tight but stretch a bit.  I suppose they need to be tight to do the work.  The wrist part is a bit loose but I imagine it would be uncomfortable to sleep with a tight wrist.  These are very comfortable to sleep in and easy to take on and off.  They machine wash and dry just fine.  I've only used them for a few days and already feel the difference on my poor dry hands.
4861,0,Color good_Again not happy with the application at this time. It is not as easy to brush on and avoid lumps
2513,0,"ugh-- i don't know why this has such good reviews_the description says, 'recreate the look and feel you get from the beach; tousled, sexy, with fullness and a light matte finish.'i really wanted this to work for me. i have thick, somewhat wavy hair. i tried it while my hair was still damp and while it was dry. it made my hair really weird... like sticky or something?does not give that 'tousled' look.didn't really add any wave, or curl. i've gotten more body out of my hair by letting it dry in a messy bun.i also can't attest to its capabilities of making your hair more 'full' because my hair is already thick.it didn't add volume at all, which is something i struggle with since my hair is so heavy.it did add texture. if you have fine hair this might work better for you but i couldn't say for sure.after putting this product on, i could not run my fingers through my hair without it pulling tangled hair out.it does cause frizzing because of the texture it adds. i.e. if you touch your hair, it will get fussy.'recreate the look and feel you get from the beach.' i don't think so.doesn't effectively 'matte' my hair the way salt-water at the beach does. my hair became unmanageable and dirty looking. and trust me when i say i'm not one of those girls who likes her hair to be perfect all the time. because most days i don't even brush my hair.because of this, it is my subjective opinion that this product does not fulfill the 'sexy' aspect of its description... more like grunge hair... jus sayin'.i would have given this product one star, but i guess if you don't touch your hair at all throughout the day the texture wouldn't bother you. for this reason, i added one star.i hate to waste anything. so i will continue to give this product a chance from time to time when i work up the patience. i'll update my review if i discover a better way of applying it. a way that doesn't make me hate my hair, feel gross, and yearn for a shower!i recommend getting this product instead:John Frieda Frizz-Ease Style Dream Curls Curl Perfecting Spray 6.7 fl oz (198 ml)i used it before kms, and will go back to it. it effectively enhances my waves without the textural problem."
1816,1,"It's A Keeper!_Better than a buf-puf, and less expensive than the rotating facial brush, so, with a little old fashioned elbow grease, this little natural bristle facial brush does all that and more. It is a great exfoliant for the face and neck, I love it! Definitely worth the $5-$6 dollars and then some. A++"
9311,0,"not worth the hype_Very disappointing, not applicable as serum it was more like a sticky gel that covered the skin instead of adsorbing in the skin."
4910,1,"I'm a Pacifica Lilac fan._I have the soap, roll-on perfume, the spray and the incense. I just find this to be the most natural smelling lilac perfume out there."
7257,1,"An exquisitely effective product with an astounding number and variety of uses_I am really impressed with this oil. I thought it would be just like argan oil, nothing new. But I am thrilled to discover that it's an incredibly versatile, effective 'miracle oil'! Maracuja is a very fine, light oil, while argan oil is heavier and, well, more oily  I think maracuja oil much better for the complexion than argan oil; it's silkier and absorbs better. It is a perfect moisturizer for the winter, as long as you follow with some sort of SPF. But I don't use it just for my complexion! Nay! It is a multi-purpose potion of powerful potential.Here are some of its uses:1) HAND MOISTURIZER. I keep a mini bottle in my purse for my hands. My hands never feel right, and I was forever reaching for the hand lotion. This stuff really softens and the soothing moisture truly lasts, much longer than any lotion.2) PSORIASIS SOOTHER.  I have psoriasis, which was invited by its known associate and frequent co-conspirator, the Rheumatoid Arthritis I've had since age 3. For some unknown reason, Mr. Psoriasis showed up out of nowhere weeks before my wedding. It was all over me, my chest, back, trunk, legs, arms, scalp, but we managed wrangle it under control in time, and I covered what hadn't obligingly gone away with a cathedral-length veil and opera-length gloves.Now it's down to just a few comparatively small patches, though they're still very visible (I embrace winter clothing!) and itch ALOT. I put maracuja oil on them when they're itchy, red, angry blotches, and it soothes way the itch and even reduces the redness and swelling! They're not as visible either. I am so stoked.2.5) MAYBE SOME ARTHRITIS RELIEF? After seeing the effect it has on psoriasis, I'm curious to see if maracuja oil might have anti-inflammatory properties that could perhaps soothe arthritic joints. I already apply it to my hands, so I'll start paying closer attention to how they're feeling as time goes on. I'll probably rub it onto my wrists as well, can't hurt, might help! I'd love to be able to get my wedding rings over my currently-too-swollen knuckle. I'm afraid of my joints swelling and making my rings impossible to take off, so I don't wear them at all. (I need to be able to remove them easily.)3) MEGA-MOISTURIZING PRIMER. I wear it under my Dr. Jart Renewalist bb cream, which is a really thick full-coverage formula I wear for performances. The maracuja oil is a lifesaver, because that cream does not properly moisturize by itself and can actually be uncomfortable without a good soaking moisturizer underneath. My skin just drinks up the maracuja oil, leaving no messy oil slick behind, just a nice glow. So it makes an excellent primer.(Tarte's own tinted moisturizer, of course, properly moisturizers.) (Yes I know Tarte makes a full-coverage foundation but there isn't a good match for my ultra-fair-with-pale-pink-undertones complexion, or I'd be using it. Despite being a bb cream the Dr. Jart Renewalist provides incredible coverage and perfectly matches my skintone.)4) NIGHTTIME NATURAL BEAUTY. I really like the way my skin looks after I've washed my face and smoothed on a few drops of oil. It truly doesn't look like I just put pure oil all over my face! It looks dewy and fresh. My husband loves it, wants me to eschew makeup altogether and look like that all the time. Truth be told, isn't that our goal, with all the skincare stuff we use? It's mine. I'm working on it. I'm not ready yet.My regular night products often make my face look red, because they are full of dermatological science heavy-hitters. I don't mind it, until I take a break and see how lovely my skin can look when I treat it with the simple, pure, natural maracuja oil instead of serums and creams from a lab. I've invested a lot in my current regimen, having bought 4 month's worth of the Sadick Park Avenue Prescription, so I'm sticking with it till I've used it up. Plus so far I like the results. But when it's time to decide what to do next, I may switch to maracuja oil full-time. Bring it off the bench and make it my starter.4.5) ALL-THE-TIME NATURAL BEAUTY. Maybe, when I feel like I've achieved the so desired evened skintone, reduced redness, and lightened my unevenly distributed but small freckles to a symmetrical smattering, I WILL stop wearing any sort of foundation and be confident in the fresh-faced glow of simple maracuja oil.5) LIP SOFTENER. A dab rubbed into my lips feels so much better than any waxy balm or wussy cream. As with hand lotion, I was always reaching for a lip balm. It doesn't taste good, though, beware. Still, it curtails the constant rummaging for lip balm in my bedside drawer 6 times a night.6) HAIR GLOSS: It takes just a few drops of oil, rubbed first on your hands and then over your hair and brushed through, to instantly soften and smooth your hair and add a beautiful shine. It's light and is absorbed so it doesn't weigh your hair down or look greasy, as long as you use the right (tiny) amount. I use a hair gloss daily. It's the last thing I do in my getting-dressed beauty ritual. To be honest, I don't choose to use the maracuja oil for this, because I don't like the smell (I'll get to that) and I prefer The Body Shop's Grapeseed Gloss or Fekkai Olive Gloss. But I have tried it and it does work wonderfully.I have but 3 issues:1) Maracuja oil has a strong nutty fragrance that I really don't care for. I find it pretty unpleasant, but others may like it, and some may not even notice it at all. I'm considering adding a drop of pure rose or lavender oil (I have them for cooking) to mask the nutty scent with a preferable floral one. I've tested it in a small amount and think it'll work without affecting the performance of the maracuja oil. Might even be better! Extra vitamin c from the rose, for example. I'm not setting up a laboratory and trying to concoct some new formula though. I just want to mask that unpleasant fragrance.2) I haven't gotten used to the wand instead of the dropper I'm used to with oil. I noticed my mom's small bottle of Josie Maran Argan oil had a wand too. Why? Can anyone explain why?3) You'll notice a smaller bottle for sale from various sellers, but Tarte doesn't officially sell anything but the 1.7 oz bottle, for $46. That smaller bottle is given as a free bonus with purchases or sometimes in kits. While I'm currently well stocked with several of the generously-sized mini bottles I received as free samples, I think Tarte should either make the mini bottle a permanent freebie choice or offer it for sale, because it will be more accessible. Then people don't have to hopefully chance upon a free sample in order to try it, or buy the small bottle from third parties who all charge different prices and don't give awesome freebies like Tarte, Ulta, or Sephora do. Plus maybe not everyone wants 1.7 ounces, they just want a little. I like Josie Maran's very affordable $14 small bottle of argan oil. I want that for Tarte Maracuja Oil. Officially.Speaking of the bottle, let me end this review on a positive note.HOW GORGEOUS IS THIS BOTTLE!? It looks just beautiful on your vanity, that rich deep regal color that looks like a jewel when the light hits it, set off by that elegant faux-wood top that looks so unique. I love it. And, as Tarte always does with its minis, and it's fantastic, the freebie minis are packaged equally beautifully. I will keep those bottles to decant into from the bigger bottle, for travel and my purse. The bottles, big and small, look positively opulent while still being serenely simple. Brilliant design.As you can see by my lengthy testimony, I think this is a really impressive product, and it far outshines argan oil, the 'trendy' oil. Tarte is brilliant, that, in seeing the market for a skincare oil, instead of releasing their own argan oil, answered with a different, (in my opinion) superior oil. That's smart business, and it shows dedication to bringing us the best in beauty products. That's one of the many things that makes Tarte so great! I love this brand."
2043,1,Makes my skin very smooth to the touch_I use this in the morning under my makeup.  It absorbs well without any greasy feel to it.
5389,1,Nail Polish_I use this green. on different color back grounds. The green stands out great. I mostly like it on all colors. It make the designs stand out.This greeen is great for making leaves in my designs.
1322,1,"Love Pink Sugar._I love pretty much every scent in the Pink Sugar line. This is no different. Smells just like the perfume, which I get compliments on ALL the time."
2776,1,"Best mask for the price!!!_This mask is fantastic, the skin looks dewy, fresh, and completely renewed after a single use. Just like with all other masks, the results will not last you a lifetime, you have to repeat the process. :)The mask will cause slight tingling of the skin when you apply it, but it will stop after a few minutes. I like the feeling because I know it's working! After rinsing, use a toner and moisturizer, and you're all set!Very inexpensive way to make your skin look radiant. And much more affordable here on Amazon than it is at Whole Foods."
4679,1,"great value, great straightener_I don't know how I ever lived without a flat iron! And this Remington was a great deal. I bought it elsewhere for a few dollars more after my stylist recommended a one-inch flat iron. There were so many options and some flat irons were very pricey. So I bought the Remington because it was my first and I didn't want to spent a whole lot on something that may or may not be worthwhile. It turned out to be such a great buy. It hits 410 degrees (and is temp adjustable) and turns itself off after two hours (I think it's two hours) if you forget. I use it on maximum heat 410 degrees for this one, and it reaches that fairly quickly.I usually have smooth hair that I blow dry straight. But, living in a humid environment, my hair can get unruly, wavy, flip out and generally be a headache when the weather stinks. My Remington has eliminated that problem. I use a leave-in styling gel (I didn't know you weren't supposed to) and Fredrick Fekkai cream heat protectant, just a slightly bigger than pea size that I work through my wet hair. After I blow dry, I go over my hair with the flat iron and I'm good to go, no matter the weather. And it lasts -- no matter the weather. Of course dry weather always is the best for hair, but I appreciate a tool that didn't break the bank. I recommend it. Why spend a fortune on a product just because it's got the name?"
256,1,"Love the name, Love the color!_Beautiful deep rich red color, and such a unique name! High quality polish, no streaking or chipping. Very satisfied with this brand. Similar quality to other professional polishes like OPI, China Glaze and Zoya!"
2546,1,"Curls my baby fine, limp hair!_I've been buying electric curlers for years, trying to find some like the ones from years ago-without success until now. This set even curls my baby fine, limp hair. I like the metal clips; they don't crimp my hair like the plastic clamp-style clips. The set does take longer to get hot enough to use, but that is not a problem for me. I suspect this is because the inside of the curler appears to be plastic, instead of the metal inside like the version from years ago. I like that you can order extra curlers in different sizes directly from Conair; the specifics and cost are include on the instruction sheet. I like these so well, I've ordered several sets,  for our mountain cabin and to have an extra set in the event the product is discontinued. Plus the price is reasonable compared to some sets I've bought that didn't work with my hair.These are the best electric rollers I've had in many years."
1613,1,"Nice color_Like many other people who play at-home hair-salon and that use these kinds of colors, I've used many brands and shades of dye. I have to say, this is one of the bests. The color has been in my hair for nearly a month now and it's just now beginning to lighten, despite (one of the few cons I have with this product) the serious amount of running/bleeding it does, in the shower. As I said, that's one of the few things I dislike: No matter how cold the water or how natural/colorsafe the shampoo, this stuff BLEEDS. My tub/walls are frequently splattered in pink and it takes a hardcore bleach-infused cleaner to get it off. However, I have this problem with other colors and other brands, so I can't hold that against this color, too much. Manic Panic bleeds FAR worse but my ultimate favorite (unless this brand beats them out, over time) Special Effects, bleeds far less.With this color, I used a purple from the same brand on the underside of my hair, mixed the two colors in the middle, and then used the pink on top. I'll include a picture, to show. Overall both colors are holding up well and very vibrantly, and I'll probably look to this brand more in the future. I hope the other colors work as well!I'd like to note that this is more of a magenta pink than a HOT pink. Which I'm fine with, but it's worth stating.Also, I applied the product over previously VERY faded red hair (to the point the bleached blond was coming through) and to about half an inch of regrowth (dark blond) and let it sit for three hours. (I leave bright stain-type dyes it FOREVER. It doesn't do any damage, and makes the color brighter/last longer)."
8247,1,"I wish I could give it four and a half stars._This is a nice BB cream that gave a smooth, matte finish (as opposed to some that leave skin dewy or satiny) and wore for several hours with no shine breakthrough on my oily T-zone. It's a little thick as BB's go and reminded me of the heavier Asian brands I've tried more than the lighter American versions. The Medium shade was too light for me, and I suspect it contains not just a &#34;brightener&#34; but an actual &#34;whitener&#34; as the Asian brands do. My skin looked nice when I washed it off, but I felt very pale. It didn't clog my pores and didn't have a waxy or greasy feel. The texture of this cream was more like a foundation, and it gave enough coverage to skip foundation and just use a setting powder with it. I'd recommend this for light, normal to oily complexions that like a little more coverage and need a little more boost in the &#34;brightening&#34; department. If the shade had been just a little closer to Medium, I'd have given it 5 stars. The SPF of 40 is a bonus and didn't break me out as sunscreens often do."
6725,1,"great_love my brushes, they seem to shed some but with the price you cant beat this set, would highly recommend"
3613,1,"Love Love Love This!_I was looking for a small kit to fit in my purse for &#34;nail rescue.&#34;  This little kit is perfect.  It comes in a handy plastic case, which is perfect and the tools are high quality.  I highly recommend it."
4918,1,"The best for permed/damaged hair!_My hair is naturally course. I got a perm last year and it's half way grown out. It's frizzy where the perm was. When I use this detangler my hair feels soft with perfect waves, not heavy at ALL. I love it. I have to use a lot, I've gone through the bottle in 2 months! I have thought about trying a cheaper detangler but I can't imagine finding one more perfect. It makes my hair look very healthy and I don't have to worry about styling it, I just let it be naturally beautiful. I also like to use CHI Kerotein spray, but that's just for hair health reasons. This detangler is a 7 second miracle all on it's own!!!"
1970,1,"Amazing! Absolutely Amazing!_This stuff is awesome!  I use it once a week and I am starting to see and feel a difference in my skin... and I'm not breaking out as badly as before.  I mix with water instead of cider vinegar.  It does not burn like some say, or turn my face red afterwards!  It's makes your skin a little tight, but not uncomfortably so... It's hard to smile and/or laugh when your face is tight like an Aztec goddess.  I highly recommend this product to others.  It's a bit of a mess mixing and a real mess when applying to the face, but it's so worth it.  It kind of clumps to the face.  I have sensitive skin and it works wonders on me.  It's definitely worth a try.  And the price can't be beat when you compare to other beauty products.  This one is a winner!!!!!"
7563,1,Love it!_I love this lotion! Its not too strong but it does last throughout the day. (I work in a clinic and patients compliment and ask what I'm wearing a lot.) I also like how it doesn't feel greasy on your skin. And you can't beat the price! The product shipped very quickly and was wrapped in a seperate envelope in case of any leaks(It had none) which was great. =) I'll most likely buy this again from this seller.
2132,1,"IT FEELS SOOOO GOOD...BUT SAME AS DR'S INJECTIONS?!_I did not know what to expect with this. I think I love it.  Time will tell as far as long term benefits. The size is much larger than I expected.  If this is the travel size, I wonder how large the regular size is?  The container is very nice and appealing. This company has be highly rated.  It makes my lips feel so good with that sort of peppermint feeling and makes them so soft. Yum!  It plumps the lips a little bit, kind of smooths out the lip lines.  It is glossy but not too glossy, as some are.  One end is for use at night and the other , the XL, for daytime use. I am going to purchase the pencil as well.  These cosmetics are very high quality. I am hoping for long term benefits but we'll see.  I live in New Mexico where the climate is so very dry.  I have purchased so many lip products to help combat chapped lips and I never buy them again.  I would buy this again, I think it is a keeper.  If I change my mind will do a follow-up review and let you know.I have recently purchased quite a few top ranked lip plumpers to try . None of them are close to looking like the injections you get at the Dr's office.  I know, I have had them done many times over the years. I do not do  lip injections anymore as I have large enough lips already.  I do them  now  to immediately get rid of nose to mouth lines,  lines around the mouth, forehead lines, etc.  It takes at least 10 years off your face instantly and lasts up to two years.  It bugs me that companies, such as this one,  say they are the same...they are NOT.  At best you get very slight, temporary, feel good, plumping action that makes your lips feel really good, but nowhere near what the injections do.  That said, there is a place for these type products as well."
3145,1,"Can't live without_Before Benefit, I'd always used liquid foundation and had to mess with concealers you smeared on.  With Benefit, they have great coverage and never feels caked on.  If you have acne, you may want to invest on a spot corrector (the green color combats the redness), and use Benefit over it. I will never buy another brand of pressed powder again."
813,1,"Biotin for hair_I bought this to help my hair thicken. After total loss to chemo, I didn't feel the hair was coming back as well as I hoped. After a couple months on this Biotin I was seeing a difference. I continue to take it for well being four years later."
8460,1,"A Little Goes a Long Way_Very concentrated.  I like that.  Since I have a house soft water system, I need even less than most.  I have used Head and Shoulders for many, many years and thought it would be interesting to compare.  I think they are both very effective, however, Head and Shoulders has that strange metallic smell that I have always assumed was needed to do the job.  The  Clear Men Scalp Therapy AntiDandruff Daily Shampoo and Conditioner smells so much better.  It might have to do with the mint, ginseng, and tea tree extract.  I think a change is in the works.  Hope this helps."
2180,1,"Paint it Black_It has some benefit...ultra hydrating and provides a great tan in 2-3 uses. The smell is the only drawback for me...has a sugary smell to it that isn't quite vanilla but isn't quite coconut either. Not bad when you first apply, but after tanning...kind of has a bad smell to it. You'll need to shower shortly after use.As far as the tanning qualities, it works great. Have seen results after just a couple of uses."
5088,1,good blush brush_I love Sigma brushes.  I've been collecting them over the past 6 months and this one is another new favorite. I bought it for a blush brush and am very happy using it for blush.
1824,1,"Larger than you might think_I got this comb to help when I put Almond Oil in my hair to give it that extra smooth silky look & feel.  I have long hair and the comb works really well, but I really only needed just a tad bit smaller width between teeth.  I will keep using this comb but wanted to let others know that the teeth are really wide apart from what it appeared to be.  I give it a four star because it's not the product's fault that I didn't get the right width, but to me it's just okay!  3 stars"
7777,1,"OMG! The BEST Make-up Light EVER!_I am serious about this - this is the best make up light I have ever used.The magnification is the best. The trifold, flip open view is great. I can see places I could not see as clearly in my previous 2 make up mirrors.It doesn't heat up (a problem with previous make-up mirrors). There's even a place to plug something into it, if you want. I like that it has a warranty. And it is much more stable than any of my previous mirrors too. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! I hope it never breaks!"
6779,1,Great tool to boost the economical value of pricy products_I do buy some pricy products that I just do not want to waste.  I bought this spatula to use every drop of those products.  One side acts like a squeegee inside your bottle then holds the scooped material so you can move it.  I use it to transfer to my fingertips for immediate use or transfer products into my small travel bottles without touching the product thus contaminating it.  The width of the spatula is too big for some of the  smallest bottles.  Great little economical tool.
8915,1,Awesome_It's China Glaze so it's awesome anyway. The color is a little too bright for my taste-I think it may go better with lighter skin tones.
2544,1,nice_they have a nice grip on it and they have that nice smooth edge when your filling your nails. they make your nail nice and soft. and they take all the dirt out of your nail. but it also takes all the nail polish off of you. the file do-sent break you less you throw it or drop it on a hard floor.
3216,1,"Great for all types of hair._This is a super sexy product with a lovely scent.  It leaves the hair looking healthy, strong and shiny.  Also, it doesn't weighs down the hair.  The fragrance is just awesome."
906,1,"Good product!_I've used this and other products as my daily regiment for the past couple of years.It is effective, yet inexpensive."
4761,1,"Multi useful & protects with a 30 SPF_I love Body Shop stuff and I've been looking for a higher SPF (higher then 15) Vitamin C cream and I found it. It goes on well and smooth, doesn't leave you looking like a white out ghost and protects with a 30 SPF. Great for us mid life folks that have abused our skin in the past.  Mix in a darker foundation (2 shades darker then your skin color) and you've got VIOLA!  --a tinted moisturizer.  Great for those that want their own skin to shine thru but gives you the protection you need."
1344,1,Very useful_This is great for getting the conditioner residue cleaned off my back so I don't get any ickiness on my back. It's also great for reaching that spot that you can never quite reach with your hands.
9329,1,"Best Conditioner_Great detangler, softener and gives high shine.  It's hard to find this product in stores, so Amazon has become my go to for Fekkai, I've tried several other shampoos and conditioners, but I always return to this brand."
5231,1,my lipstick_L'Oreal lipstick is always good.  This shade was beautiful and it had free shipping as well which made me happy too.  I would buy this again.
4488,1,"great lipstick_I really like this lipstick, it is very smooth and shiny...I do recommend this lipstick...it goes on well, is true to color, stays  on and doesn't smudge, and I don't have to wear a gloss with it, it is shiny without a gloss!love it!"
3658,1,"Cool product_This is going to be a 2 fold review.1. This is a great eyeliner! I put this on, and went about my day. My eye itched and without thinking, I rubbed my eye. Normally by this point, my eyeliner will be smudged everywhere... when I took out my mirror to look, the eyeliner was in place, no smudging, wasn't even worn off. It stayed on all night. It didn't smudge or smear or fade at all. When I washed my makeup off for the night, it came off nice and easy with a little water. So this is an excellent eyeliner. This is the first eyeliner I have seen that actually does what it says. Stays on all day, and doesn't smudge. Was VERY happy about that.2. This isn't the best temporary tattoo pen. Most of my temporary tattoos last a few days. I have one that I made several days ago that still hasn't washed off. This tattoo pen works to a point. I drew a heart on my wrist, as soon as it was dry I covered it with baby powder (to set it in. just use a makeup brush to brush it in and brush off the excess powder) once I did this, it didn't smudge or smear. It stayed on nicely. If it gets a little wet however, it will smear if you touch it before it dries. You have to let the area dry completely before touching it. If it gets a little wet and you let it dry before letting anything touch it, you're good to go. However, once wet, it washes off really easily with a washcloth. you don't need makeup remover, soap or anything. Just a little water, and one or two scrubs with a washcloth. So if you are looking for really temporary, temporary tattoos, it works... but it comes off really easily, so you may have to carry the pen with you to touch it up if it gets wet.So as an eyeliner - A++As a temporary tattoo (emphasis on the temporary) - B+it's definitely worth the buy if you're looking for great makeup and a fun tattoo making pen."
8757,1,"Very nice!_I have tried quite a few BB creams and I really like this one.  It's oil free and doesn't break me out.  It also leaves a satin matte finish and has pretty good coverage.  Honestly, I don't even feel the need to add a tinted powder on top, which I ALWAYS do when wearing BB cream or tinted moisturizer.  My go-to BB cream for the past year has been Smashbox but this one leaves more coverage and has more of a silky feeling going on. It feels kind of greasy on my fingers but once it sets, it doesn't feel greasy on the skin.  For this 'texture' reason, I prefer applying this product with a brush.  I have been using my Real Techniques Expert Face Brush to apply.It does not feel like Missha BB cream going on (the only Asian one I have tried, but too light for me and breaks me out) but it offers more coverage than a tinted moisturizer and doesn't feel greasy once it has set.  I have been using the medium color.  Normally I'm about an NC 25-30 but I have tanned a bit so I'm more like an NC35 now.  I'd say that the color medium runs a touch darker than the medium in the Amazonian Clay foundation.  It's also a bit darker than Smashbox Light Medium.  I'd say that the color tends warm.  It lasts really well.  I do use a translucent finishing powder on top (usually Tarte Primed and Poreless loose powder), as I do with all foundation products.The big minus is that the color range has only 4 colors.  I think it'll be too dark for me from late Fall through early Spring.  At the moment, the Smashbox Light Medium BB cream is slightly too light, so i'm thinking that I'll switch back to Smashbox in the dryer weather.  Don't get me wrong, I love Smashbox too, but I like that this product has a bit more coverage.  Lasting power is great.  I recommend this as a good summer foundation."
8739,1,"good facial scrub_I'm well satisfied with this facial scrub, though not so impressed as to give it 5 stars or have it become my new standard. I like to use a scrub on my face during showers, and usually select a product with salicylic acid to help keep slightly acne-prone skin clear. I like Biore's about as well as other clearing scrubs; I'd be happy to use it again, but will probably continue to stick to what's most easily available or cheapest among similar products.It seems to clean well, lathers sufficiently, and prevents acne about as well for me as other salicylic acid products - although I note that this is only 1% strength, vs 2% in most similar products. The exfoliation seems a bit more gentle than some others. So if you're looking for a product that's a bit less harsh this may be your best bet. If you need full strength acne prevention and exfoliation this may not be your favorite. The smell is perhaps a bit medicinal but not unpleasant and is gone anyway as soon as you rinse."
657,1,travel case_purchased this cricket cool down iron travel case for my daughter as a gift; she travels a lot and uses it a flat iron; works well
3023,1,Love it._My daughters love to put curlers in there hair and these work great they go to bed and in the morning there hair is very curly.
8343,1,"Gets the job done (7oz Sensitive Gel)_The Dove Men + Care Sensitive Shave Gel comes in a 7oz pressurized container in the usual dark gray colors of Dove Men+Care. The gel generates a satisfactory amount of foam to get the job done. This is a traditional shaving gel, not a near see through gel like the King of Shaves.Scent, the closest thing I can think of is an attempt to make it smell a bit like a barbershop shaving cream. After shaving, it leaves the skin feeling fresh enough that you don't have to apply after shave balm unless you want to. It does not replace the need for after-shave but makes it more of a 50-50 call."
468,1,Great for all nails!_Love the nailtiques protein line. I recommend the line to all my friends no matter what state their nails are in. The #2 protein helped my nails become stronger and I could see less cracks and strains in my nails within a matter of weeks. You can feel the difference in your nails within a week though. Great investment!
5329,0,"An alcohol-based shine product?_SUAVE VIBRANT SHINE is a spray that contains some silicones, which are common in beauty products to provide lubrication and shine.  It also contains mica which I assume makes up the shiny, pretty particles that are suspended in the liquid after shaking.  I found it at my supermarket for under $3, and I was excited to try it.  What a disappointment!  I didn't check the ingredients until I got home.  The very first ingredient is alcohol which means the product contains more alcohol than any other component.  Alcohol's effect on hair is well-known, and that effect is not to increase shine.  Alcohol is very dulling and drying to hair.  Oh well.  Maybe the alcohol is just the conduit for the silicones and mica?  I hoped.I gave it several tries.  When I took the cap off and took a big sniff, I could really smell the alcohol, but I didn't get too much of that when I sprayed the product on my hair.  I found the added scent to be fairly light and pleasant.  Unfortunately, I got no added shine.  I applied more product the next few times and still no shine.  The rest went in the trash.The problem is most people don't need shining products if their hair is healthy.  Mine can be dull because it is processed with color and heated almost daily with various styling tools.  If your hair is processed and dull (thus prompting you to look for a product that adds shine), an alcohol-based product may be the last thing you want to put on it!"
1693,1,"works well_This is much better than gel or foam or hairspray.  Your hair doesn't seem to have something in it, and it has a faintly, pleasant, manly smell.  You can also travel with this past without worrying about it spilling, which is another benefit."
12,1,"GOOD GOOD GOOD&#65281;_Very good makeup remover, I'd like to use it, not too greasy, but after using the cleansing is very clean."
6799,1,Love this mint green color!_Exactly what I was looking for - a pale mint green color!  I think it is lighter than the picture shows.  I gave it 4 stars because I don't think the Gelish goes on as nicely as Shellac or OPI Gelcolors.
1681,1,"Best Lotion I've ever used! Period._This really works better than I ever imagined a body lotion could. I recommend dry brushing first, then use this. There are plenty of videos on the internet on how to do this. Your skin will feel like a baby's skin....I am not exaggerating! I will never buy another lotion again! (I bought the Yerba dry brush here on Amazon, FYI)"
1280,1,"Makes combing my daughter's hair a nice experience!!_My 6 year old daughter has hair to her waist. Combing wet hair has been a horrible and painful experience, until we were told about this brush by our hair stylist. It is AMAZING.  I am able to comb thru her wet hair, even when it looks like  a tangled mess! It is painless and quick! I cannot say enough about this! I bought it from a salon for $20 and would do it again...so this price is awesome!"
2259,1,"The absolute best!_I have extremely dry hands and I get excema on them in Chicago's colder months.  My hands crack and bleed in winter and actually get sore from being so dry.  My dermatologist recommended this and gave me some free samples.  It worked so well that I bought a few tubes and now this is all I use for my dry hands in Fall/Winter.  I gave some to my dad because he has the same problems, and he loves it too.  It heals the dryness without being greasy or oily.  I've also tried lathering it on my hands before bed and covering them with cotton gloves overnight, and it works wonders."
6070,1,"SLEEK BALM!_Okay, its not for me,but I am told that this is the best stuff and my wife complains that its sometimes hard to find locally.according to her, the Amazon price is the best she has seen.so no only is it the balm, its also a bargain!"
4308,1,great product_I have used this before and have come back to it.  Makes my skin feel soft and seems to reduce fine lines
1704,1,"not bad_these give a decent curl, not as easy to use as i would like, you do have to connect or thread one through the other to make them stay in.  took about 6 hours in almost dry hair, but the curl held.  not for you if you want the curl to start close to the head like i do."
9589,1,"Wonderful for the dry winter!_I have fine, but thick hair, and it tends to get really dry in the winter. This product works wonderfully to reduce breakage and soften my hair. The texture is thick, but not sticky and rinses out well."
9860,1,"Packed with vitamin c!_Seems to do the trick. Wish it smelt better but the hips don't smell of roses and for the cost, very happy with product. You pay so much more for rose oil but it smells so good!"
1454,1,"Smells great, great price!_I wanted to purchase cologne for my husband, so I went to Macy's and eventually picked this out. I found it on here for a fraction of the price, so I returned it and bought it here. Smells great and lasts forever!"
526,1,"Will not buy again_I really like the color, and it goes on nicely.  However, it doesn't last very long, so will not purchase again."
6675,1,"Silky Sun Days_If you want more than just a sunscreen, this Hawaiian Tropic Silk Lotion is lovely. Goes on more like a body lotion, but does have the scent of summer (kind of a cocoa butter/coconut vibe). The scent does not really last, so you don't end up smelling like you have spent the day at the beach if you are just out and about, which I prefer.I keep this right at the tub, and after showering, slather it on before getting dressed. It dries quickly and leaves my skin soft, but not greasy or shiny. The sun protection seems to be adequate for daily use.Definitely recommend for that daily sun  protection we should all be practicing!"
2022,1,"Great Lotion_I have used this product for years. I have mild exzema and this lotion allows my skin to stay hydrated. The price has come down over the years and this is the only lotion I use, I think going on at leat 10 years now. I keep this in solid rotation. My son has exzema and so he has used this lotion since he was a youngster as well. Great for kids and adults, no issue, also working out a lot this allows my skin to breath and not feel like I am covered in a heavy product. Great buy."
5546,0,"Not crazy about this product at all._Over priced and does not prime well. I have bought cheap $7 dollar primer at drug stores that work better. Arbonne Primer makes a huge barrier between my skin and makeup so the makeup will not stay on my skin. Also does not prevent my skin from getting oily and barely changes the look or my pores. I used it for 2weeks just to give it the benefit of the doubt, hoping it would begin to work. No results so I threw it away. I would not buy this product again. The bottle it comes in is bulky/heavy and does not fit in my makeup case. It did not irritate my skin, which was a plus but it did not deliver primer effects."
2471,1,"Love Opi_The color is wonderful, no chipping, easy to apply and this color works with all skin tones.  Another hit from Opi."
6801,1,"I don't think I'll ever go back to cheaper ones!_After having regular cheaper ones cut off my circulation I saw these and figured I would try them out. They are SO lovely! Great for pulling my long hair back, great for doing the insanity workouts ( i haven't had to readjust my hair ties at all!) and also look great on my wrist. It seems like a little amazing ribbon! I love these colors too!"
9286,1,"A Simple Product That Does An Awesome Job_What would you have if you took a pouf net sponge / shower ball and straightened it out into a large, single sheet?  A BelleShe Exfoliating Bath Towel!I have to admit, I wasn't sold on the idea when I was offered a sample to review but once I tried using them it was like a showering revolution!  While that may be overselling it a bit, these textured towels work a LOT better than the shower balls as they lather nicely and they allow you to have complete control over the pressure you're providing and exactly where you're able to get it.  These towels work great on feet and between toes and they are more than long enough that you can easily scrub your own back from top to bottom.  It's such a simple idea that I'm surprised that it's not the standard as of yet.The bottom line is I love this product and give it five stars all the way!"
9148,1,"Pueen is doing it!_I love this whole concept from when I purchased my second set of Pueen plates, now I have a hot pink case for some of my other plates. I love it! Will be using this case for my first Pueen Set. I got it when it first came out so they all came in plastic bags. Love it."
139,1,WOW_I work fast food so you can imagine how terrible that is for someone with sensitive oily acne prone skin. I went to spend some time with my sister straight after work one day and she had me use these and WOW is the best way to describe these wonderful things. My face felt completely clean like it cleaned away all of my makeup and i felt it cleaning my pores. I looked at my face the next day and it looked so much clearer than it has in years. I will definitely be buying some of my own and i recommend these to everyone who want a clear and clean face.
729,1,Finally a nice brown tanning lotion_I have fair skin. This product gives an instantly brown tan. 25 years of looking for the perfect self tanner has finally paid off.
293,0,Don't like_Pretty sure it caused my face to breakout so I stopped using it.  I do not recommend. It is Very cheap.
1896,1,Nice_Smells just like Shea butter I happen to enjoy that smell. You get soft feeling skin afterwards with this entire line.
8155,0,"dissapointed_I really wanted to love this flat iron. The whole idea of being able to basically skip a step (blow drying) sounded fantastic to me. Unfortunately it did not live up to the hype. I will say on damp hair this flat iron definitely dries your hair as good as a blow dryer. I was in awe, now comes the sad part. IT does not straighten well at all. I do not have hard to straighten hair. All though not curly, I do have wavy, thick hair. This flat iron simply could not grip my hair tight enough to give it the tension it so needed. Talk about a let down. Maybe this thing needs floating plates like others I have tried. Just would not grip my hair no matter how hard I tried to clamp down on the handle. With a little work I believe this could be a great flat iron that saves you a lot of time. But sadly, mine is going back to Walmart tomorrow morning, what a shame. :("
4834,1,Gelish - Midnight Caller_I would describe this color as a very pretty shimmery slate grey. Looks great on! Covered well with 2 coats.
231,1,"Good_Good for detangling but still confused about the shape of those teeth, other-than that it helps to detangle 80% of the tangled hair especially after the shower"
4026,1,"Super Hydrating but a little Pricey_First, in all fairness to my five star review you get a lot of product for the money and only need a little to cover my longish thick hair. This product really works. It has some super ingredients and I like to change around my products as my hairdresser recommended I do this so even though you can get a lower priced product as one reviewer claimed that works as well I am not sure you get a super big amount that is guaranteed to last you through many many hair conditioning sessions. This works great,,makes my hair soft and manageable and last several days. I have used many top salon products like Chi, Aveeda etc. and this holds it's own. My daughter used the hair shampoo and that is how I found this product. I switch it around with Kheil's Olive Hair Masque and Aveda's  hair Masque and find this product definitely in the same class with other well known products so to those who give it less stars for the pricing I don't agree due to the large quantity, amount needed and results. I will continue to use this product."
8495,1,"Feels good_This cream just feels good on the scalp.  Zinc, the active ingredient, is good for a lot of things from galvanizing steel to fighting the common cold to preventing dandruff.This is the first hair styling substance that I liked for making my scalp feel good.  I think this is a great product."
9099,0,"It is ok, not a favorite_This has a surprisingly decent taste but that is pretty much it.  The chalky, gritty mouth feel is not good.  The addition of fruit makes it passable and at least drinkable.  For a hardcore protein shake drinker I would say skip it,  there are others with considerable more protein and better taste and texture to be found.  My sister used it up in her breakfast smoothies so had considerably less problem with it than I did."
1729,1,"Works great, excellent price and paraben free_I have large pores and oily skin and have been looking for light moisturizer to use under make-up that is paraben free and this works great!!  I just use a little under make-up and that is all I need and does not get greasy (again I just use a very small amount.)  It also doesn't clog my pores and cause breakouts.  And it is such a great price you can slather it on when you are feeling dry or need a beauty boost.  Use it on your chest area as well.  Excellent product and so glad paraben free!"
1086,1,"Non-greasy, truly effective, healthy sun-protection--at last!_Our favorite sunscreen of all time is Shiseido's Anessa--but at $50 for a small 60ml container, it's not for everyday use for all over--we just use it on our faces, where it counts most. And Anessa lasts for only about two hours per application.But for an all-body, super-effective, completely natural, apply-once-and-forget-about-it sunscreen, you cannot do better than Solbar Zinc SPF 38. Sure, it's a tad heavy. You do FEEL it on, if you apply it to your face. It's definitely there, working hard to provide an effective barrier between you and skin cancer, between you and painful sunburn.My experience with sunscreens is that the heavier they are, the longer they last. If you use Shiseido Anessa, you'll have to reapply every two hours. If you use Solbar, you might not have to reapply at all. Seriously. And the price is reasonable, if not downright cheap.Upgrade your skin from the usual Neutrogena route (we used that brand for many years and hated it the whole time). Solbar has got it down to a science.Lastly, the reviewer who said Solbar is greasy, well, I could not disagree more. Solbar is NOT greasy. Not oily. In fact, there are NO oils in the sunscreen whatsoever (which is good if you get clogged pores, like me). Solbar is a substantial layer, however. Mostly silicones (which protect the skin from drying out) and transparent zinc (which does the sun-blocking). I'm buying another tube of this stuff now--good to have one in the car and one in the house. Especially if you live in the Southern California sun like we do."
3744,1,"Perfect_So easy to use with either hand.  Picks up images and transfers them well.  The scraper does scratch the plates, but I've not noticed it marring the design at all.  The larger end is great for my first four nails and the smaller end gives me versatility with my pinkie and small designs.Troubleshooting advice:  I did run a fine-grit buffing block over the rubber ends prior to the first use and I clean the stamper with acetone between each application.  Not had any problems so far."
3452,1,"holy grail of undereye concealers_Simply AMAZING!  I have an extensive collection of concealers from trying to hide my hereditary dark under eye circles.  Bobby Brown (dud, returned it), massive range of drugstore brands (ok, but just cannot cover & last), Laura Mercier (nice but $$), Benefit Erase Paste (up until this was my go-to killer concealer).  I was so happy with Erase Paste I'd stopped searching; and then received a sample of Bye Bye Under Eye... I'm hooked.  A little goes a LONG WAY; light dab and then touch/dab to blend, then maybe feather in edges with a concealer or foundation brush.  Some have complained about rub-off and creasing but I've not had that problem, perhaps because I &#34;set&#34; it with a powder.  I'm sure any powder you like would do but I happen to have some Laura Mercier powder left from their UnderCover Pot.  Hold up to full day in Texas coastal heat & humidity.  Will buy again and again."
4016,1,"Bright and Beautiful_I purchased this palette because it contained a red and I was told red pigments are not good for your eyes so it's hard to find a good red shade. I'm not a fan of buying small individual shadows so I purchased Creative Me because of all of the bright colors and online it has good review. It's great for very bright spring looks and the color pay off is great. It was well worth the price and the shipping was fast. The palette is constructed well meaning the mirror isn't loose and it does close completely. The two greens look supremely similar, but they aren't as close in color as I thought so I ended up liking them more then I thought I would.The red isn't as red as I would like (it comes off a little light), but that's me being picky. I do recommend this product, the colors are amazing and they are easy to blend and work with."
4272,1,"No complaints_This foam soap works well for all of us - me, with my super sensitive skin, and my baby. Easy to apply, easy to wash off and no irritating smell. Good product."
3890,1,very pleasant smell_i used this oil as a scent to my homemade hair products & it's very pleasant. it isn't overwhelming either.
9182,1,Not just for stretch marks --_I have only been using this for a few days - but I am using it with a dermaroller and I have already noticed a lightening of some stretch marks as well as age/sun spots -- plan to keep it up
3724,1,"Tangle banisher_This conditioner has worked wonders on my niece's waist length hair. If she were to cut it, it would be naturally curly, so it also has the course texture sometimes associated with naturally curly hair.  Because of the length and it's tendency to curl and frizz in humidity, it's a constant battle to keep her hair tangle free. We usually braid her hair or put it in a pony tail just to try and keep it as manageable as possible. Products like Frizz-ease help, but so much is needed due to the length of her hair that it gets unbelievably expensive. When talking with my hair stylist, she recommended the Just For Me line. Even though it's marketed for African-American hair, she said it should work for my niece's.Between this, the shampoo, and the detangling spray, her hair is now incredibly smooth and almost completely tangle free. The conditioner doesn't leave a heavy residue, which is wonderful, and it smells of baby powder. The product is on the watery side, and doesn't seem like it will work well, but it does. Don't use too much or the hair ends up feeling very over conditioned and waxy as if it wasn't rinsed out very well. Compared to other products, the price is good. This is a line where the products really do work better if you use all the same brand. We tried using this with another brand of shampoo, but it didn't seem to stay as tangle free as well or as long. After a couple months of use, this product and others in the line have done wonders for wild hair."
3016,1,"FABULOUS DEEP CONDITIONER_This product is scrumptous! A little costly but the results are fantabulous. My hair was silky, soft, shiney and healthy looking. To achieve these results I used product as a deep conditioner, placing a plastic shower cap and sitting under a dryer for 30 minutes. WOW! I can't wait to do it again next week.Miss Jessie's Original Rapid Recovery Treatment - 12 oz"
2114,1,"the best tinted sunscreen!_I've tried other tinted sunscreens (La Roche-Posay Anthelios and Revision Intellishade matte - both highly rated, but not for me), this is the best color and texture.  Expensive, but worth it.  I've had two skin cancers removed (melanoma) so have to use sunscreen now, will only use this product."
1302,1,"exceeded my expectations_I am one that values the opinions of others and like most read reviews on an item prior to buying it. I was planning on buying an item 3 if not 4 times more $ than this item because it had better reviews and is a brand I am familiar with. I have better skin thanks to a recent Zeno purchase however you still have to wash your face several times a day. My old regime was using a puff buff and a cleanser that I felt was best suited for my skin. If it is a facial cleanser chances are it is in my toilette closet. When I bought this I thought this item would be my back up item. However, it has proven to do A LOT more than I thought. I have heard complaints about it not vibrating and that you have to do so. Or that a washcloth is better. After using it for several weeks here is my review. First of all let's face it, if you are left handed it is easy to clean the left side of your face and vice versa. I don't know about you but when washing my face and usually taking makeup off I leave the water running to rinse my buff puff. If it is a washcloth you not only get stains on it but it is all over your face and you waste more cleanser with a washcloth. I used the pads that came with the device and wetted them as instructed. It lathered up really well and I did not keep the water running. I felt it cleaned not only my face better but I was able to get my neck and side of my neck which breakout frequently as well. The best thing about this device is it is NOT just capable of using the pads intended for it. I am not a huge Dove fan and although it cleans well sometimes I need something stronger. I have stuck a buff puff on the device and then put on a heavier cleanser and it works great! I also have stuck face pads for a well know company that is more abrasive and also the Ponds facial clothes. They ALL stick to this device and I find myself cleaning my face a lot longer and cleaning it better. What I love the most is during the winter my hands get really chapped and blistered. Or even in the summer if you have a cut on your hand this device is a dream. No more running your hands under the water and applying it directly to the harsh chemicals and rinsing. The device is my fingers and it has truly helped my hands and skin since it touch my face, not my bare hands. I love this product and am glad I gave it a try and knowing it is so diverse I could not be happier. I think for the price you get what you paid for and a whole lot more! It is definitely worth it!"
283,1,works just as the name describes_This product works quickly and and is mild enough to use once a week on sensitive skin if massaged gently. I love this product!
1851,0,"Frizz Ease is way better_Tresemme Smooth & Silky Shine Spray does not compare to Frizz Ease shine spray. The spray nozzle on this product is messy and I feel like my hand is covered in shine spray every time I use it, even after just one mist. You need to hold the bottle pretty far away from your head or else you will have greasy and wet looking spots. Would not buy this product again"
9826,1,"Great Facial Toner for All Skin Types_InstaNatural's rose water comes in a large, 4 ounce brown glass bottle. 100% pure Moroccan rose water makes a wonderful toner, cleanser, hydrator and replenisher for your skin. Rose water is gentle enough to be used on all skins types; oily, dry, normal or combination.The rose water has only 1 ingredient - 100% pure Moroccan rose water and helps restore the skin's natural pH level. Besides using as a facial toner, the floral water can be used to remove makeup, as a final rinse when washing your hair and as a soothing addition to your bath water.I like to use InstaNaturals rose water as a facial toner after I wash my face in the morning, and again at night. I have combination skin which is oily around the forehead, nose and chin area but normal to dry everywhere else. I've also used the rose water mixed with a bit of witch hazel to create a cleansing facial treatment. I soak a cotton ball with a bit of the rose water/witch hazel mix to refresh my face during the day."
1810,0,ok product_not quite sturdy and hooks are short so not very effective when latching onto hair and holding it in place. would not reorder
2706,1,"Old gold standard_This product has been around for a long, long time and has proven its worth many times over.  Never found one I liked better."
2999,1,ONE OF MY MUST HAVES!!_I love this brush it's soft and smooth. I use it for if I have to much eyeshadow on and want to blend at the top. I also start using it for blending in my concealer when I line up my eyebrows. I think everyone should have at least two of these brushes forget all the rest of the blending brushes this is the best one out there! Thanks Eco Tools.
8279,1,"Thought it would be greasy on hair, but it's not!_This stuff is amazing. I used a few pumps on my medium length coarse wavy hair. It's amazing! My hair looks healthy and it tames frizzies. It responds very well to the straightener when I've used this product and gets much straighter than it normally would.I've also used it on my rough heels and like the result so far.The scent is a fruity musky  mix, but it isn't something that is overpowering, and I don't notice the scent on my hair. A friend of mine with shorter finer hair used some when she was staying with me this weekend. She's very sensitive to smells, and it didn't bother her at all. It also didn't weigh her hair down. She used just one small pump.Disclosure: I received complimentary product in exchange for my honest review. I got it free this time, but it's definitely something I'd buy in the future!"
8564,1,"Great, soft little brushes!_These brushes are a bit shorter than I pictured but they're great! Very soft and smooth, they make my makeup application so much easier and my makeup looks more even and smooth. I have super sensitive skin and these feel very gentle on my face and don't irritate me at all. They're also very easy to clean because they're compact. Very happy I purchased!"
7876,0,"Cheap, stiff and way too big_I understand they are probably not meant for everyday use but for the price I thought I'd order them anyways. Came Fast, but the box was all tore up and the lashes smelled like chemicals. They are really stiff, and made of plastic. Not too mention really, really long ! Not too happy, but hey for the price I can't complain too much. You get what you pay for. Buy at your own risk !"
8670,1,"Great_I'm a shower gel nut. I love trying new ones. This was the first time I tried an Axe product and wow, it's nice. It lathers up very nice, rich suds and has a very nice clean scent that does linger even after the shower. When I worked out later in the day and was sweating, I even smelled Axe then. This is very, very nice."
8085,0,"Not Too Impressed_I am a makeup junkie, always eager to buy the newest product to hit stores, and this mascara by Maybelline was no exception.  I bought it without reading prior reviews based on the product's commercial, the tube design, and past experience with Maybelline mascaras (all of which have been positive).  However, I was very disappointed with this one.First of all, the brush is very thin with short bristles.  It is curved, which I like, but the arch seemed more pronounced than in other curved brushes, probably because of the lenght of the bristles.  In person, the brush looks different than how it is pictured on Amazon and Maybelline's website.  The awkward shape of the brush made it slightly more difficult than other brushes to apply this mascara to my lashes; I feel it could get very messy if you aren't careful or aren't used to this type of brush.Second, it did not give the cat eye effect I was halfway hoping for.  I knew it wouldn't look exactly how it looks on the model (does this ever happen?) but I thought there would be a flared look, however slight.  Even if I applied extra mascara to the outer corners, my lashes were all the same lenghth and had the same lenghth as when I applied a different type of mascara.Third, this did not give the great volume that I expected from a Colossal product.  Rather, it made my lashes thin and kind of spindly looking.  It clumped slightly but I was able to fix this by going back through my lashes and using the tip of the brush to seperate them (this was a hassle!).  The formula was also very wet and took longer than other mascaras to dry, and I feel that this impacted the clumping.  In the end, this product gave me a look that was not as dramatic as I like but slightly more than an 'every day' look.There were a couple of good things about this product but they do not outweigh the cons.  It gives pretty decent lenght, the color is dark, I don't notice any flaking, and it removes easily at night.  The tube is cute and the product is inexpensive ($5 at Wal-Mart).Overall, I do not reccommend this product.  Other Maybelline mascaras are great but this one is a dud.  If you want a truly great, inexpensive mascara, I would reccommend the original Maybelline Colossal Mascara."
7621,1,"Absorbant and no lint!_These microfiber towels are great.  Microfiber is definitely the way to go!  I have found that it is more absorbent that traditional terry cloth towels and, best of all, it does not leave lint fuzzies all over the floor.  I have below the shoulders long, thick hair and I wrap my hair in one of these towels with a clip immediately upon exiting the shower.  It does a fantastic job of not only getting out all of the dripping water, but also going a long way towards actually drying my hair.  These towels are also good for general wiping up, as they don't leave lint all over the counters.  Highly recommended overall."
197,1,"Great little hairdryer!_We bought two of these hairdryers for our kids because our regular hairdryer is a bit too bulky and heavy for them. Since they are still pretty young, this hairdryer is perfect for smaller hands, and has plenty of power to dry even long hair quickly. It's also very lightweight, which makes it great for travel. Lightweight, plenty of power, easy to hold. All in all, a good value for the money."
9702,1,"Smells great, leaves my hair silky soft_I'm one of those lucky gals who has been blessed with a bird's nest for hair. I often look like I've dropped a radio into the bathtub with me or stepped on the third rail. Even when I use conditioner, my hair is often dry and rough to the touch after is dry. After trying this shampoo, with no conditioner at all, I was surprised at the results. The smell is mild and pleasant - I am sensitive to floral scents and try to avoid anything that is too 'perfumy' - this is just right and I smell clean, but not overwhelming. After my hair dries, my hair is so much softer to the touch than I'm used to with my other shampoo. Very pleased with this product."
332,1,"Nice lather, rinses clean_I'm really enjoying these unscented bars so far. Doesn't seem to be pore clogging, lathers well, cleans well and rinses well. No itching after."
3935,0,"Doesn't stick_I tried dying both my lashes and brows, and both were a disaster. It did not stick more than a couple days on either, and when I rinsed it off my eyes, sone got in and it was very uncomfortable.Save yourself buying this, and just get them done. It's well worth the money for those results"
6679,1,"Smells good and good protection_My daughter loved the smell of this and it seemed to provide good protection. The smell was a bit strong for me, but that's personal preferance. It did seem to moisterize as well as protect."
3122,1,"Tempting to use non stop!_Cuticles are nature's way of protecting your nail bed and nails, but there are times when they've got to be trimmed.  Maybe they're dry, cracked, peeling, whatever.  These clippers are so easy to use.  Just be careful not to overuse!!"
1079,1,tried to live without it....but why??_I have used Murad one and off for several years now. I am about to turn 58 years old and this serum helps hide that little fact nicely. It tones....it tightens....shrinks pores.....does it all. I'm just resigned to the fact that it will be Mama's little helper for the rest of her days  :)shipping was fast.....product was packaged nicely.....no complaints at all. Would order again and again
4395,1,Winner._Ive been meaning to order this for months. Its the best for regrowing edges. It came on time in a cute bottle. I only use a bit on each temple so it should last at least 2 months. It has a smoky smell that i found kind of strange at first but it ok now and it the thickness of syrup which i kinda like since my hair is thick as well. Its the thickest oil Ive ever used. It moisturises my edges very well especially since its thick. I has new growth already
6673,1,"Moisturizing Sunscreen_This is a high quality moisturizing sunscreen with a tropical scent.  I found it works well as a sunscreen and felt better going on than your average sunscreen, probably due to the moisturizing feature.  Men will likely find the tropical scent to be too feminine.  A little expensive, but overall a nice product."
6405,1,nice_nice soft and gets the job done...keeps the shape unlike the sedona lace one. i would purchase again. its huge brush though
5643,1,micro links_yep this work very well for a extension.thought the picture show was way smaller than product itself.is isnt small like the pic you see here.it little bigger.thought i cant tell the sizes cause they tell you. but happy with this sizes. work very good indeed.
4215,1,"Works well, but bleaches clothing/sheets._Benzol peroxide is a great treatment for acne. The price for this tube was nice! Be warned, though: the 10% content means your clothing and sheets WILL bleach if you aren't careful."
3148,1,Works GREAT!_Works so great that when my daughter visited.... she hijacked it! I'll be buying a new one to replace it :-)
3636,1,"Neutrogena Healthy Skin Eye Cream, 0.5 Ounce_Neutrogena Healthy Skin Eye Cream, 0.5 Ounce really does work and I like the product. It's not harsh or irritating."
7538,1,Great Color Lots of Fun_This is a great purple color and we have lots of fun adding a splash of color to our hair once in a while.  It washes out great and never leaves any trace of color on my blonde hair.
7220,1,as adviertised_These tools came in their own little plastic sleeves and I was pleased with them. They worked just as I expected them to.
2519,1,Best thing for the sides of your nose!_Works perfectly! I get black heads in the creases on the sides of my nose and this is great to keep them in check. My husband gets pimples sometimes on his back and says this is much better (but not painless) than me trying to squeeze them.
6527,1,"Great colors_I love these colors. Each color is slightly larger than the size of a quarter, so there is a lot of powder for the price. There's everything needed for both dramatic and more natural looks. The pigment is good, but probably not on par with more expensive eye shadows. My eyes are very sensitive and this barely bothers them (which is about as good as it gets for me). My only disappointment was that one of the shadows arrived broken and made a mess over the rest of the colors."
8792,1,"Nivea got it right_I'm sensitive to a lot of perfumey soaps and stuff that may tough my skin. My forehead breaks out from additives like a petri dish.  Nivea's body wash is wonderful stuff. Well-balanced and not bad for a sensitive guy like me (I hear that groan), sure prefer this to a soap bar!"
3279,0,"Not great_I find the smell pleasant and I like the consistency of this face wash, but that's where my affection for it ends.  I have mild to moderate acne - some stubborn blackheads on my nose, pimples that crop up fairly often and all over my face.  I was hoping this face wash would clear them up, or at least slow down my acne, but I found no noticeable improvement.  In fact, I find that this face wash often leaves a film on my face so it never feels really clean.  I have since stopped using it and began using Oxy Face Wash, with noticeable improvement.  Perhaps if salycilic acid works for you, you will love this face wash.  I will stick with Oxy and its benzoyl peroxide formula."
770,1,"Great Body Wash, has some scent_I'm a big fan of the Dove body wash. I don't have particularly dry skin, so I like the moisturizing level present in this product. Unlike some other body washes that feature more of a oily feel to them, the NutriumMoisture seems to be mostly glycerine based, and my skin absorbs it readily without getting goopy. I also find the cleansers to be gentle, and non-iritating to my sensitive skin.One note: this body wash is NOT fragrance-free. It's &#34;unscented,&#34; meaning there is fragrance added to make it smell like &#34;clean.&#34; If you'e highly allergic to any sort of fragrance, you might want to avoid it."
8136,1,"MMMMM feels good on my skin  . . . Oh Olay . . ._Age: 55skin type: slightly sensitive with occasional redness from RosaceaFirst off, the pump bottle is great! I just tried another product (not Olay) that was $60 for this tiny tube and the pump bottle, in a word: sucked like the suckest sucker in suckland. Now here's this Olay product that kicks the ass of the expensive one and doesn't spit expensive product all over my walls, blouse, hair, mirror. yeah.It doesn't take much of this moisturizer to be effective - which is nice, since I am sick of spending lots-o-cash on expensive facial cleansers and moisturizers. Sometimes expensive is better, and sometimes expensive is just that: more money, not any better results.This is what I love about Olay products - they try to find effective products without digging their paws into our wallets until we beg for mercy.When I pump a bit of this product (and you don't need a lot!), it has a luminescent look to it, and that I like. Maybe I'm fooling myself, but I feel that luminescence will be on my face as well, and it does seem to transfer in that way. I spread a bit on my clean dry face and it feels wonderful - so good on my skin, very silky smooth-ahhhhh. I don't care what it has it in, honestly. Just because it feels so good, that's enough for me. It's not expensive, so why not? Leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean - and there's a slight fragrance that I enjoy -- it's not heavy, but just adds to my 'mmmmmm' experience. And, as well, there is no irritation for my slightly sensitive skin and Rocasea - no redness, no stinging. It's not greasy, so there's no clogged pores to create blemishes, either.This is one I'll buy."
1876,1,"Best Of The Best_I've been using brow powders for a very long time. I've used top make-up department store beauty lines, independant beauty boutiques in Manhattan and SoHo, European lines and brow specific beauty lines via online. In my eyes a good brow powder is worth a few extra bucks if it works.  I've never regretted trying something new even after finding something better. They all have their good points.  Anastasia is however hands down the best I've ever, ever used to date.  I wear Ebony. The color looks...weird to the naked eye, I bought it anyway. On my face it is pretty perfect. Applies with absolute ease, wears exceptionally well,  Ebony is perfect for my skin tone, even the highlight color is perfect. Looks like I've found a new #1 brow powder...for now. Smile. 5 BIG Stars!"
676,0,I would give it 0 stars! Gross!!_I like JLO but this fragrance is just discusting. I hate it. One of the worst smelling perfumes of the century. I would not spend one cent on this. I collect perfumes and have huge variety. I can tell you this is one of the worst if not the worst I have ever smelled. LIVE smells much better.
7483,1,"A good conditioner for the price_I wash and condition my hair daily and have tried dozens of different conditioning products over the years.  I believe that Clear's Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner is a good product that does what it says.  It has a nice fragrance and luxorious feel.  It works as well as if not better than similiarly priced conditioners.  It left my hair feeling soft but not weighed down.  If you are looking for a good conditioner in the $5/per bottle range, you should give this product a try."
2737,1,Great set!_Great set of brushes. I like that EcoTools brushes are smaller than other brands. It makes them very easy to handle and control. Great for those just starting out using brushes!
8448,0,"Too thick for my type of hair._This product was very thick and heavy. I don't think it was very suited for my type of hair (i.e., short, gray and fine.) It had a very pleasant scent, and cleaned well...but it felt like it took a lot of scrubbing and rinsing for me to get it all out.If you have long and thick hair...it might be just the thing for you. However, if yours is short and fine...I say you might want to look for a lighter product."
5242,1,"My favorite_I have searched high and low for the perfect mascara and this comes pretty dang close!!! I have used the really expensive ones to the drugstore ones and this feels like the luxury brands without the price tag. Does not flake, clump or smudge and is a beautiful dark black."
3203,1,Awesome body wash_I've been using this body wash for about a year and am very satisfied with it. It smells great and leaves my skin soft and nurtured.
3917,1,"Great cream blush_I love this cream blush and this is the 4th one I've bought from NYC.  Would compare to the old Nars cream blush....great color, can use finger-tips or a brush to apply and it's great!  This is a great color for all skin types as well"
2575,1,Love!_I love all Obagi products. It was recommended to me by my wonderful dermatologist. I especially love the C serum and use it every day to even my skin tone.
2669,1,"The best!_If you have sensitive skin and/or skin allergies, this is the best soap for you! For years I was &#34;all natural&#34;, staying away from every chemical there is, yet still I was having skin issues. Skin tests showed I'm allergic to botanicals as well. as chemicals. This soap has been a lifesaver. All it is is olive oil and salt. Just be sure to get this particular bar for Kiss My Face also makes an olive oil with aloe etc.It's a pretty dense soap so lasts quite a while, especially if you use a soap holder that drains.Also, I've found that getting these large bars & slicing them in half (giving you 2 good sized cubes) makes it last even longer."
8673,0,Lots of breakage!_I guess my hair just doesn't like keratin because after using this product for about 2 months my hair is horrible! I've always been told that I have beautiful hair and it's always been so full of life. The first time I used it I thought it was great but as the keratin builds up in your hair that's when the breakage started. My hair is so thin now and it's usually very thick. I can't run my fingers through it and I have tons of split ends now. The hair around my face broke off so bad and is now starting to grow back. I now have bangs! I definitely didn't plan to have them but now that I stopped using it my hair is growing back finally. I had my hair cut a couple of months ago and it still is the same length! My hair grows fast but the breakage is keeping it the same length. This product isn't good and I think most people will find that they don't need keratin in their hair. I'm going back to Redken.
4538,1,"Worked for us_Two of the women in our house are blessed with curly, prone to frizzy hair.  I'm not the primary user of this shampoo, but it seems to be liked by our gals and doing the job!"
6033,1,Use it everyday_The balm is so thick. You know that eye balm should be used for several months and we can see the effects. Wait and see.
6047,1,"Adds body and shine - quick styler!_I use this tool regularly on my wavy, fine hair.  It styles quickly, with its 3 settings and the ionics smooth as it dries.  Great for bob haircuts, and love the cool setting!  So glad I ordered this."
4451,1,"KEWL_my HAIR IS PAST MY BUTT ALL ONE LENGTH , thin BUT TONS OF IT.This REALLY WORKS WITH MY HAIR I think it will work in any hair you can dial down to adjust heat too I luv It and the waves are beachy , and the waves stayed till nxt hair washing !!!"
8812,1,good product_I like the product. It's not greasy nor does it leave a residue on my pillow when I wear it at night.  But I was hoping for a bit smoother and softer hair after its use.
8414,1,"Smooth product_First, this item came from Asia (whomever I chose to buy it from), so it took almost 2 months for it to arrive.  However, it finally did.  It's &#34;cute&#34; packaging (better for a teenager or someone in their 20's) but who really cares about that...the product itself is quite nice.  I've used it a few times now on my nose and slightly out to my cheeks - this is the area I have the largest pores.  The rest of my face I use the e.l.f. primer.  This product glides on really smoothly, and has a nice matte finish.  After letting it set for a moment, I apply the rest of my makeup.  I don't know if this really makes my pores any smaller - but it does a nice job of &#34;filling&#34; them in and creating a nice base for my makeup.  I'm not sure if I will purchase again, as the wait was incredibly long.  I guess I'll see as I get closer to needing a refill."
7010,1,"Manicure Set_Used these tools for other artistic applications.  Works with nails just fine.  Easy to use, good weight, easy to clean."
9834,1,"Safe, gentle and natural cure to cradle cap!_I love Rosehip oil for my own daily skin routine - a wonderful way to moisturize my skin and to add vibrancy to my hair.  Our little one had terrible cradle cap and I did not like all of the options out there to treat (up to and including GMO-filled vegetable oils) but I didn't want to leave her with a flaky, dry scalp, either.  So I massaged a few drops of the InstaNatural Rosehip oil into her scalp every morning and night.  Within two days, you could see the cradlecap clearing and by day 5, it was completely cleared!  I am still using a little on her head each night just as a way to prevent the cradle cap from returning, and incorporating it into our nightly massage routine.I love that the InstaNatural Rosehip oil is natural and certified organic!"
6648,1,"Never been a fan of feather extensions -until now !!!!!_I had a really bad experience with feather extensions before that I had put in, in a professional salon. After reading the reviews, though, I decided to give it a shot. Wanted to do something different to my hair without having to color it and for the price, I figured it was worth a shot. These are beyond, WAY beyond the quality of the feather extensions from the professional salon and last a long time, while still looking great. Give them a shot!"
3650,1,love!_I am 26 and got my first break out of adult acne. I have never had bad skin and if i ever broke out it was during that time of month and only lasted a couple of days. This was worst than ever and lasted for over a month and showed no signs of going away. I tried this product along with the facewash and within 2 wks my skin has cleared up dramatically. I am so pleased with this product!!!! my skin is clear and feels moisturized without being greasy
7956,1,"Clean and well dispensed_Dove Men Plus Care body and face Wash, in Fresh Awake scent works well as a shower gel.  I've been pleased with the results.  I don't so much consider it as a face wash, myself.  It has a pleasant scent, which is familiar as a 'male' cleaning product aroma, much like some deodorants.  The gel is thick, and comes out of the dispenser at a reasonable rate so you'll be less likely to waste any.  That's nice.  The container works well as a dispenser.  Not all shower gels can say this, so I'll have to acknowledge that point.If you're a man who likes shower gel, and wants a shower gel aimed at men... this is for you."
3460,1,"LOVE this stuff, but like the tube applicator better..._First, the product is AMAZING!! I don't know how what's in it, but it WORKS! You just put it on your eyelids BEFORE your shadow, like a basecoat, then apply your shadow...and BOOM! it lasts for a looooooong time. like at least 12 hours.I have noticed that it is harder to blend when using this. I normally like to use just two colors a 'shadow' darker color, and a lighter 'highligter' type of color. And I like to sort of blend/fade the darker one sort of in an ombre type way. But this makes that fading-to-light blending process difficult. You can use a VERY light hand on the fade-ier sections, or just a lighter color (which I feel works better.) I don't fault the product for this, I mean it is DESIGNED to grab your shadow afterall! It is just in my application method.I do prefer the sameUrban Decay Primer that comes in a tube.It seems that spongy applicator is a little gloppy for me and I always end up smearing it around correctly with my finger anyway. Plus, no applicator to get dirty! I used to like the straight applicator they had, but you could never get all the product out of the container. The newer angled one here helps that, but I always bang it on my eyelashes or get a clump at the tip which ends up on my eyelid (which needs to be smeared with my finger!)Here's is how I use it:1. Do mascara FIRST! If you blink or sneeze and get a spot of mascara on your primed eyelids, you have to start ALL over...you aren't wiping that black speck away with this primer! Let it DRY! (I usually do foundation while I wait the minute or two.)2. Apply the primer. With the wand, I usually aim for the crease of my eye and blend the still-wet primer around with my fingertip. You can use the wand once the tube gets emptier, but a newer tube will have too much product on it to wipe around. Put it anywhere you put shadow (I go all the way to eyebrow.) TIP: I have indeed tried this stuff on the lower lid. My eyeliner seems to fade quickly, and I thought this would help. My experience hasn't been too effective this way. It still fades/smears. It doesn't work well to cover blemishes, either (I have tried that, too!!)3. Apply your eyeshadow LIGHTLY!!! I mean, take less than you usually do, you aren't getting any extra off with a brush or a tissue. You can always add more in different places (like the crease), but you don't want to look like a Barbie with painted on rectangles above your eyes! If you are using those sponge-tip applicators that often come with eyeshadow, STOP!! Honestly, a shadow brush is MUCH easier to control. It is too hard to see how much shadow you have on a sponge-y thing. They are cheap, or take one from some watercolor paint set your kids have (those crayola ones are sort of NICE!) I start with the darker color and add highlighting (like under your brow) last. You can attempt to blend, but the colors won't move around too much. You can check to see if you need a little more somewhere and add it. A third 'medium' color makes the process easier to fade from dark to light.4. Get ready to fend off suitors!! :D5. Removal: I use make-up remover (vaseline works, too) and those round cotton pads for this since I normally have waterproof mascara. I don't use the primer all the time, usually for times when I know I have a long day or will be somewhere where it is hot (it works there too!!!)  I haven't had as much luck with just washing it off, plus I really don't like to rub my eye skin too much if I can help it. And I figure that oily eye-makeup remover is like an extra moisturizer!"
9525,1,"Love The Scent- Must Spray Carefully Though_I'd give this 5 stars for the scent. I have bleached blonde hair and while this does give some shine - it's really important (for me, at least) not to spray too close to the hair. Even at a distance, it immediately made  my hair look really super greasy. Too far away and it has little effect. However, at the inexpensive price, I'd give it 4 stars and say that experimenting with the right distance is worth it - but make sure you don't experiment with it right before a big event!!"
2187,1,"Good Sunscreen!_I love this sunscreen. It feels like a moisturizer rather than a sunscreen.  It does not sting or burn my skin like so many other sunscreens.  It does not leave my skin feeling oily or greasy either. I have one complaint and that is that the packaging sucks.  I hate the tube because the mouth opening is way too big and makes it very messy to dispense.  I wish they would put this in a pump bottle instead.UPDATE: While i really liked the feel of this sunscreen I have discovered that it does not offer the level of protection that I really need to prevent sun damage and wrinkles.  I have switched to 'Eco Logical's' face sunscreen, as that one does - and feels great too!  I deducted 1 stars from my original 5  Check out the EWG website's sunscreen rating guide."
5378,1,"Salon quality at home, best product ever_I found a coupon for John Frieda Precision Foam Colour about a year ago and decided to try it and let me say I have not used another hair color since.  I always used a traditional cream hair color until this product so I do recommend when you go to mix the color with the solution do not shake it tumble it as though you are mixing wine in your wine glass and let it sit for a minute or so before you use it and make sure to squeeze the bottle in the middle to get the foam correctly out.I used to have to color my hair once a month and wierdly enough since I started using this product I only have to use it every other month because it blends so well to my hair.  I have honestly never had a color mishap with this product i.e streaking or parts of my hair being colored more than other parts.  This honestly is the best hair dye I have ever used.  Once you use this product and get used to the application process you will never switch to another product.  Definitely salon quality at home."
2364,1,love_How did I make it this far in life without owning for audrey?  this is the perfect light blue polish
2523,1,It appears to be the real formula_All appears to be as promised with this conditioner. It arrived in perfect condition no damage or leaking. Thank you!
5804,1,"Interesting_I thought this thing was really cool, the only use I have for it, is applying mascara for my upper lid as I have really long eyelashes and sometimes when I apply mascara, I get dots on my eyelids and it gets messy. With this, I just hold it over my eye and apply the mascara, having the lashes touch the plastic. I think I saw a youtube makeup guru use a business card for this technique, but I think this is way better and it actually contours to your eyeball instead of a hard piece of paper. I don't use the lower lash portion and I don't use the comb. I want to say, that you will need 2 hands to use this, one, holding the applicator and the other holding your mascara wand. Normally, you would hold the mascara tube and  mascara wand but you won't be able to, so take your mascara wand from the tube, set the tube aside and then take this applicator and put it over your eyeball and then proceed to apply your mascara. The tiny little comb thing works pretty good and it separates your lashes pretty well. When I'm done, I wash the mascara off the applicator with soap, cause I get a lot of mascara on it. Overall, pretty neat idea and its cheap too."
6661,1,Great stuff_this leave in conditioner works really well and the price it right.  leaves your hair smooth and shiny and not weighed down.  I think it works as well as the expensive moroccan oil.  Great stuff.
5011,0,Maybe got a bad batch_I have used this conditioning treatment before and enjoyed it .But this batch seems to be a little watered down
2176,1,"Just as good as what you pay $60/bottle for at the tanning salon!_I was pleasantly surprised with the color I got with this product.  It was equally as good as several that I had paid $60/bottle for at the salon!  (I don't tan anymore, but used this when tanning before my wedding.)"
2648,1,"Totally long-wearing lipcolor_L'oreal Infallible Lipcolour is truly the best, most long-lasting lipstick I've ever used.  It does not wear off.  Ever.  Until you deliberately remove it with an oily makeup remover.  Fantastic product, would always choose this line whenever I want to wear a darker color so it won't smudge.I only gave this four stars due to the fact that the color is way off from the photo.  On the page, the Mulberry looks like a gorgeous deep purple-plummy color, but in reality is MUCH lighter and not purply at all, but rather a rich, creamy medium pink...Nice, but definitely not what was shown at all."
1850,1,Thee Perfume to Have!!!_This is THEE perfume to have! I get more compliments on this one than I do any other fragrance I own and there's a reason for that. You spray it on just a few times and you are good to go. Its endurance is outstanding cause it lasts all day and all night. No need to carry it with you. The aroma is so sweet and relaxing and it makes you feel very feminine. I absolutely love this fragrance. It is my favorite to date. Gotta have it!
6586,1,I love the nail art set!!&#128079;_I love the shany nail art set very nice colors the only problem that I had with it is that one or two of the colors were damaged a little bit but other wise excellent!!
627,1,"Wonderful_This shampoo is the greatest. I don't use it everyday since the product specifies not to, assuming it will dry out your hair to much. I use it every other to every 2 days in between my regular shampoo. This shampoo leaves my hair soft and very shiny. The smell is nice too."
8477,1,"Only thing that holds_When I was in school, the guys I knew would use egg whites to make their hair stand-up.  Boy am I glad that those days are over!  This spiking glue holds really well and does not smell bad.  It's a little small, so I end up purchasing a new tube every two weeks or so, but it does the job.  My husband doesn't have really long hair, but he has spiked the front with a little wave to the tips for years (ladies, think Jason from General Hospital).  This has been the only gel-type substance that has been able to hold that look for an entire day, even if we are running around at the park in the sun.  I definitely don't see him switching any time soon."
273,1,LOVE_I love OPI.  I love OPI colors.  I wish they came out with great lipsticks as well.  Maybe not blue but other great colors.
2695,1,"Great lotion_It's very moisturizing to skin. All it contains is petroleum and glycerin with stearic acid (a fat derived from either animals or plants). It kept my skin moisturized all winter, but maybe I will buy some of my own glycerin and add water and petroleum jelly and see how that works. I love it, though for the most part. The only negative is that it has parabens in it and doesn't last through hand-washes (have to re-apply)."
4142,1,Great_These are a great set of brushes!I really love that all of Shanys brushes are PETA approved as well!
2206,1,works super well_I love this top coat it works super well on my nails and lasts a long time for a heavy nail and hand user.
4438,1,"Great shampoo_I've used the Kiss My Face products before, but, when I saw the 'value size' and the price, I grabbed it.Then I read some of the reviews.  Dries hair?  I was very anxious because I color my hair because of the white (not grey!) growing in.  The color process that I use is excellent, bought here on Amazon.  It left my hair soft and silky, much better than a box color.However, I was terrified of using this shampoo.  I finally took the jump, and my hair is clean, soft, silky, thick, curly, manageable.  It's still a bit frizzy, which comes naturally with curly hair, but it's always had a tendency to be frizzy.  I use a small bit of coconut oil and smooth it over my hair.  No more frizzies.As to the need to use more because it doesn't lather, it's not supposed to lather like other shampoos.  The main ingredient that makes shampoo lather is sodium laurel sulfate, which is very drying, and it's almost impossible to get all the 'bubbles' rinsed from your hair.  I don't pump the shampoo into my hands; rather, I pump it directly on my scalp - a small one of each side, two for the top, three for the back.  I've found this is a much better way to get the shampoo to the scalp, where you need it.  I work that into my scalp, and I can feel the shampoo in my hair.  If you massage your scalp when you hair is went, it feels much differently than when you massage the shampoo into your scalp.  The shampoo will dissipate rather quickly, but it thoroughly cleans your entire hair.Everyone has different hair, and what works for one, may not work for someone else.  I tried a When shampoo, and it was awful for my hair.Any questions, feel free to ask."
7947,1,acrylic nail wheel_this is cool to try designing your nails before you do your own. it should have an easier way of breaking them off to put in the demo finger. it was fairly quick delivery seeing it came from overseas
6431,1,"Beautiful, Unique Fragrance_Shalimar Initial, in my opinion, smells completely unique from Shalimar. Personally, I do not care for the scent of Shalimar at all. Shalimar Initial attracted my eye because of the beautiful bottle and pink color of the liquid. It looked very soft, mysterious, flirtatious and old-fashioned in a classic way. The fragrance matched the bottle to my delight! Shalimar Intitial is a light, warm fragrance which clusters to the body as you go about your day. I find several squirts last me for hours...at least 5-6 hours. And yes, I can apply this liberally without overwhelming any passersby. As I mentioned before this is a light, soft fragrance that has a gentleness as it's characteristic as well as refinement. In my imagination I see a young Victorian woman Gibson girl-like, with a rich oak vanity. Atop the vanity is an ornate crystal bottle containing this fragrance of which she applies to her neck and hair each day. She's a young woman with a busy life and yet the pace of her life is much slower than we know in modern times. She walks a little slower to admire the flowers as she takes her morning walks in the countryside. She accepts the sensation of cool raindrops on her cheek and delights in watching the flames flicker in the fireplace as she sips her cup of tea. This perfume reminds of a time where things were simpler, yet no less exciting and when the moments of life were savored. This fragrance smells very old to me and yet young all at once."
528,1,love it_It smells heavenly. I feel a lot more awake after spraying it on my face. It dries to a little bit sticky but I'd think that's because it has hydrating property. One of the best toners I've ever tried.
7157,1,"Won Over a Skeptic_When I saw the color of this sunblock, I was worried. I'm a brunette with fair skin, and this looked like bronzer. But as I applied it and blended it in, I found that it looked natural and I wouldn't need to use any foundation with it.I was also skeptical about the 'matte' claims-- all sunscreens I've used have left my skin at least a little shiny, and I have slightly oily skin that's prone to breakouts, so I really don't like anything that adds extra shine or clogs my pores. But this one really was matte once it dried. It felt light and fragrance-free (important to me, because I get migraines from scented products), and it stayed on all day, but I had no problems washing it off at night.I love that this is made with nearly all safe skin products (PEGs and alumina are not great, but the two active ingredients are safer than more common sunscreens).All in all, this is a great product for people with my kind of skin, but it's a very small tube. 1.5 ounces isn't going to last long, so it's not a product I'd use every day."
529,0,"Smells good but not exactly sure what's it's use_I purchased this for longer flights which tend to dry out my skin. I usually use the Evian spray but opted for this due to the pleasant scent. Considering it's pricier, I would likely not purchase again because I don't think it adds much. The scent is nice and it does last for quite awhile."
3682,1,Love it!_This little device is awesome at cleaning my face.  My skin feels so much softer and refreshed after using it.
4409,1,"Nice colors, stays put, good for sensitive eyes_I usually have problems with eye makeup. Most eyeshadows will cause my eyes to tear up all day, which is not attractive, and then I give up wearing makeup at all after a few days. This eyeshadow set hasn't given my eyes any problem at all, and I'm very sensitive. The other great thing about this set is that it's mostly soft matte colors. There are 6 or 7 total with a bit of shimmer, but it's very subtle. The colors are in the cooler range of plum, brown, and pinks. Very good for creating nice daytime looks suitable for the office. I'm also at the age where I was concerned with eyeshadow that might cake up in creases, but have not had any problem at all with this set. It lasts all day until I use makeup remover at night to take it off."
1019,1,Excellent Product_I love this handy hair dryer.  Works well with all types of hair and is dual voltage. Overall a wise choice.
3382,1,my favorite red lip color_this Red matte is by far my favorite brand and color. it has just the right amount of moisture while still having a matte look. this is my second purchase and will buy again!
5382,1,Really works_I have real bad small stray hairs around my crown and always wear my hair in a ponytail for sports.This works great and doesn't leave white flakes.
4070,1,"A very nice product._Over the past couple of years I have become quite obsessed with body washes.  Why, not really sure.  So when I saw this product by Olay, I thought I would give it a shot. The 'selling point' with this body wash is it refreshes, moisturizes dry skin, prevents aging and of course cleans.I don't want to vaunt, but I really don't suffer from super dry skin.  Therefore, I don't know how well this product works on dry skin.  I can say that after using this body wash, my skin isn't dry and shows no signs of dry skin.  The soap/wash itself lathers up rather nice on a wet puff.  In addition, a little goes a long way.  I must also say that this body wash has a really nice smell.  It is really refreshing.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants nice skin and would like to stay clean."
6773,0,Ehh_They're okay. I thought they would stick to the nail a lot better. Even if I add a clear coat on top of them they still peel off.
4518,1,"It is an ok buy._So I got both set from bundle monster. Only after buying and using and then looking for more plates I realized that this are dupes, with some images not seen before, by me. I am over all impressed by by quality of this product.From this set I got,BM03 plate the images are not centered a couple of mm and the designs would have gone of the plate. It also is missing a peace. It looks like it moved during etching/engraving and cutting process. Since none of the designs on this place are ruined It not that big of a deal to me, but it dose this out to me because it like that. The BM10 is baddy scratched. I do not care for that design so it not that big of a deal to me. Lastly the full nail designs do not fit my thumb nails. How ever this also is not a problem for me because I like to keep my thumb, ring or middle finger nails as ascents nails, different deigns and/or colors.Pros:Cheap, great value.Wide chooses of designs.Clear image transfer.Cons:Full nail designs are too small."
489,1,great polish_I love Essie for the quality and colors and I love that Amazon often has a good price.  Pleased with my polish.
3660,1,"Great Serum_I originally got this in a small sample, used it, and wasn't entirely sure it did much of anything.  I had been struggling with under-eye dryness issues, flakiness, and had tried no end of products to address this without success.  While this isn't the only product I'm using, I have used it steadily through a full 1.7 oz bottle and decided it was effective enough to buy another bottle.  There is no scent and it is non-irritating.  I use it only at night, but I do think it has greatly improved my under-eye dryness issues, perhaps lessened wrinkles slightly as well, although I don't have many problems in that regard.  My first bottle lasted about 7 or 8 months, so a little goes a long way if you are only using it in limited spots.  It has an eyedropper to dispense the serum, and for my usage, one small drop is enough.  A lot of eye products irritate my eyes, and this one did not do that.  The viscosity is moderately thick, but not overly so.  I like this product enough that I will continue using it and it is one of my favorites.  I'll add that there are very few products I consider 'must have' at all times, and this is one of them."
2181,1,Paint it Black_I've only used this product about 4 times. I'm pretty fair skinned so it takes longer for me to tan but so far I like this stuff
5299,1,"As effective as more expensive serums!_I have been applying this serum underneath my moisturizer every night for a week, and I have already noticed a difference!  Even after a single application, I noticed how silky-soft my skin felt.  After a few days, my skin took on a nice luster.  After a week, the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles is noticeably reduced.My problem areas are my throat, eyes (crows' feet), and forehead.  I have especially noticed a moderate improvement in the texture and appearance of my forehead, moderate improvement in the corners of my eyes, and perhaps a small improvement on my throat.I have tried products ranging from Avon to Lancome and Clinique.  For the price, this serum is just as effective as some of the more expensive products.The label on this product warns that it may cause slight redness or tingling.  I have not experienced any problem with this product, but I have noticed a stimulating sensation that makes my skin feel awake, alive.  For me, it is actually quite pleasant.  Perhaps someone with very sensitive skin would find this unpleasant.  Even though I have not had any problem, I would recommend applying this at night for the first couple of days just in case of unsightly side effects.  Anyone sensitive to retinol may want to avoid this product altogether.In conclusion, it's not how much money you spend on a product; it's how well it works.  Don't expect a serum to work miracles; it just can't happen.  This serum will give your skin an immediate smoothness, and may moderately reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines.  There is no product on the market that can honestly claim to do more.  For my money, this one works."
71,1,"love_i love this powder, it never makes my skin shiny. its the perfect color for my skin tone. and i will buy again and again"
5245,1,"Comparable to 'high end' brands_This is a great conditioner.  I grow my hair out to donate, so it gets really long.  In between donations (about every 2 years), I want to try and keep it as healthy as possible.  I usually use Aveda products, but that was getting to be too expensive.  I generally like Neutrogena products so I gave this a try.It works great!  It is so moisturizing and leaves my hair really soft. I honestly believe that this is comparable to the performance of Aveda's damage repair conditioner (for MUCH LESS money)."
3318,0,"Streaks_These product does give you a glow, but it streaks. I actually threw it away since it wasn't worth returning."
6760,1,"Great for painting over and removing, not sure about actually keeping on my nails._So affordable it's hard to go wrong with these. I used them to paint over the top and then remove them for a dual colored design and they worked really well. I'm not sure how they would work to actually use them on your nail for the design as they were not very sticky. I realize you would put a top coat over the tape but I just can't see how it would really stay on there. Since I didn't buy them to use like that and I really did just want to paint over the top and remove the tape the colors I received didn't really matter to me but I think I got 3-4 duplicates so if that is something that matters to you, you might want to be a little weary of what colors you could get. Overall I really like the tape and am excited to try all the different designs I have in mind and have found on Pinterest. Plus the price is crazy good! The shipping time was a bit long but for the price I'd wait twice as long if I had to."
4437,1,"Great product, more scent options would be appreciated._Having finished chemo and radiation treatments I have become quite a 'post cancer hippie' with regards to all of my personal products. I don't want anything with a bunch of toxic ingredients. Once you really start looking at the ingredients list of products... well, it's more disturbing that I ever realized. I use the EWG skindeep database and try for only products that score a 2 or below, but have a few that are 3 or 4. ([...]I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for about 4 months. This was by far one of the most difficult categories to find something that met all of my criteria AND my boyfriend was happy using. This is what we've settled on and I love it, but he's not crazy about the scent. I'm not either but that's not a big deal to either of us since it works and the scent is really only noticeable when you're in the shower, it doesn't linger... Of course lingering scent might be more of an issue as more of my hair grows back - LOL.After MUCH research, trial and error - the natural beauty products I have happily settled on that are1)Low in toxic ingredients2)Still quality products that work well and3)Readily available on AmazonBurt's Bees Radiance Serum(Toxin score: 1)Juice Beauty Refining Finishing Powder(Toxin score: 2)Juice Beauty SPF 30 Tinted Mineral Moisturizer(Toxin score: 3)Larenim Blush(Toxin score: 2)SANTE All-Natural Eyeshadow Stick(Toxin score: 2, the blue, green, rose and pearl are all pearlescent, but the coffee, olive and white are more matte; the rose, white and pearl are good for highlighting.)Ecco Bella Mascara(Toxin score: 1)Lavilin Deodorant(Custom toxin score: ~3)Avalon Organics Vitamin C Cleansing Gel(Toxin Score 3)EO Everyone Soap Lavender and Aloe(Toxin Score: 3)Kiss My Face Whenever Shampoo and Conditioner(Toxin score: 2)CoverGirl Outlast All Day Lipcolor (Toxin score: 4, not bad and the performance is worth it to me.)I hope this is helpful for others with the same intention.9/30 update - I decided to start a blog with all of this (and more as I go)- if you're interested it's at PostCancerHippie.com or facebook/postcancerhippie"
4344,1,"I like it a lot!_I have only used this on my face and neck area so far.  The 1st time I used it, I applied 1 coat, waited about 5-10 min's and applied a 2nd coat.  In about 4 hrs. I had a nice tan on my face!  It isn't as noticable on the neck area but that section seems to be more stubborn with any product.  I wish I could tell where I've applied it, but other than that, I think it's great so far!  It creates a real nice color and is easy to apply; smooth and creamy feel to it.  I will keep using this and I'm sure I'll end up buying more.  I wish they had it in a larger, pump bottle.... great stuff!"
8215,1,"gentle lotion_This is a nice lightweight lotion. It is oil-free and non-greasy. It absorbs quickly into the skin. It has almost no fragrance. I like that it contains some sun protection (it has an SPF of 15). This saves me from having to apply a separate sunscreen. Although this is a facial lotion, I also like using it on my hands. I wash my hands a lot, so using this lotion on my hands reassures me that my hands have suncsreen on them all the time and are protected."
4084,1,Love It!!!_I love this glossing cream;a little goes a long way.You'll only need a dime size amount to do the trick. Not only does it make my hair silky and smooth but it smells really nice. If you're tired of dry(unhealthy)or dull hair.... you should add some life and shine to it with this cream.
5105,1,"Great seent, good moisturizing_Lovely scent and works well to clean and moisturize.  I only use this when I feel my scalp is getting dry and it seems to add extra moisture.  The conditioner isn't one that leaves your hair limp nor does it feel greasy; it's just the right amount of conditioning."
3177,0,"Not my color._This was not my color, but I guess you can't expect the best when you order makeup off the internet."
8329,1,fun scent and bottle_This is a fun scent and engaging bottle for young kids (my 8 year old granddaughter however thinks it is for 'little kids').Does not irritate and the smell quickly fades so that it does not irritate those with scent sensitivities.
9073,1,"Exfoliates wonderfully!_This reminds me *exactly* of the texture of crystals used in spas. And it should, since they're made of the exact same thing. I add some of these to my cleanser about once per week and scrub - works beautifully."
830,1,BEST!_I love this perfume one of my all time faves! smells amazing my husband loves it. and of course bottle is adorable. i dont think Britney has ever made a bad perfume though.
1548,1,"Wonderful lotion!_I gave this lotion to my daughter for Christmas! She had it in herWish list and it was a nice size, great smelling, lasting and silky lotion!"
7270,1,"My favorite BB cream_My friend went to Korea on vacation and brought me back a ton of samples of this BB cream. I fell IN LOVE with it instantly! It's amazing, really. If you love BB creams, this needs to be in your collection.It's way better than American BBs in that it's nice and thick and covers like a foundation vs a tinted moisturizer. A little goes a long way so this will last you forever.One thing though, Korean makeup is very pale, and while I am usually a FAIR in American makeup, I am a MEDIUM in Korean, so make sure you take that into account when ordering and go a shade darker."
1126,1,Best tightline eyeliner!_I've used similar products to tightline and it never stayed on. This stuff won't move all day long. I've literally worn it sun up to sun down and had no problems. Love it.
9886,1,"Pleasant feel on body,  works well_I had never used Carave lotion, although it had been recommended once by my child's pediatrician. It absorbed quickly, left no greasy residue, left the skin seeming moisturized, and had no perfumey odor, as expected.I did not use it on severely dry or eczema-affected skin, as I use stronger preparations for that and am dubious of lotions for such areas.It seems rather pricey, so minus one star for that.I received for free from Amazon Vine which requires my review.Regarding the shipment: Amazon has in the past shipped lotions and other liquids in an envelope with no protection, generally leading to leaks of up to half the bottle. I am happy to say that this was shipped inside a sealed plastic pouch and was received with no damage. Athough shipping it in a padded envelope would not have been my idea of a safe mode of transport, it arrived intact."
7252,1,"Good for the price_This was my first experience using a straightener on my unruly, curly hair. For the money, it works well. It heated quickly, has three temperature settings and is easy to handle. I appreciate the swiveling cord, which keeps it from falling off my small bathroom counter. My only criticism is that upon closing the iron, there is a noticeable gap, so it's important to squeeze firmly to get the hair straight. Then again, it's not a $100+ model, so I'll forgive Remington and gladly keep the extra $50 in my wallet. Recommended as a bargain alternative."
319,0,Nothing great_I am very disappointed with this product because I see nothing great. I used to use Bulgarian rose water purchased from amazon as my toner. It used to tighten my pores and give me a good fresh feeling. Also my skin looked great when i was using it. I tried this for a change and nothing great infact i broke out after using it. Not liking this product
9493,1,Suave Naturals 2_Suave makes basic hair care products.  This product has a nice fragrance and lathers up very quickly.  It is a combination shampoo/conditioner so depending on your budget this product provides a new alternative to traditional shampoos.
5220,1,Love them_Exactly as expected and as pictured.
5505,1,Great first edition_I love the Urban Decay Naked Palettes. The first one has a lot of great shades. You can mix and match these endlessly. It's also a great value because buying the UD shades individually runs about $18 each.I do wish that they would take this palette and put it into the same packaging they did for the Naked2 Palette. This packaging is very cheap.Recommend.
6884,1,Great product!!_I bought these because I like doing my own nails at home and this is a really great product!!! Great price as well!
1857,1,"Good_Love this stuff but it won't hold up on a long day.  Washes off real easily too, which is nice."
2013,1,"Maybelline new york expert wear twin brow and eye pencils, 107 blonde_Nice pencils, easy to apply and don't wear off easily.  They last a long time, and don't seem to dry out."
2843,1,"Works over time, but there are side effects_I love using masks with all kinds of different benefits! The claim to reduce acne is true, sulfur naturally kills bacterial acne and therefore will help acne. In some commercials, endorsers say 'put a little dab on your acne and it will disappear over night!' In my experience this is not true. I generally try to use this mask once per week to help with acne, and it does help control acne. Sulfur is only proven to fight bacterial acne, not cystic.Unfortunately my pale skin turns beat red and stays red up to a day after use of this mask. I suppose this is a slight allergic reaction to the sulfur, or maybe just over sensitivity. My suggesting is try using a little bit on a small part of your have, and then use it in other areas if you do react badly.This is the only product from the proactiv line I use, although I have tried the entire line."
6351,0,"Go to the salon for this product...too many fakes out there._If doesn't pay to go the cheap route here. It's more expensive in your salon, however you KNOW it's the real stuff. I've been burned too different times trying to save money since I like this product. This is my most important hair product I use everyday, love the real thing...but far from it from this seller."
4563,1,"Calms my sensitive, combination skin_I was surprised when this product showed up with my mail a couple weeks ago, apparently I won a drawing I only vaguely remember entering several months ago.  I've been wanting to try Weleda products for a while now, but since half the products I buy end up in the garbage because they irritate my sensitive skin, I'd been reluctant to shell out the cash for this pretty spendy brand.  So even though I've been wary of oils since what I'll call The Great Jojoba Mishap of 2012, I've heard so many good things about Weleda products that I couldn't help trying it.  Wow.  I'm hooked.  I have super sensitive, acne prone, combination skin that goes crazy this time of year (winter).  Keeping my acne under control requires me to use cleansers and benzoyl peroxide which leave my skin feeling dry and irritated.  I try to at least use a moisturizer that is more on the 'natural' side, but it has been hard to find one that moisturizes enough without making me break out.  Although I had my worst skin problems pretty much under control, I had still been noticing some small red bumps, uneven tone, and weird texture before I tried this product, probably due to irritation from my skin treatments.  Well, the morning after I started using it the redness had already cleared up, and my skin just looks more supple and vibrant.  I've been applying 3-4 drops of this almond oil twice a day instead of my regular moisturizer and it has made my skin so happy!  And best of all, it doesn't seem to be making me break out!  Although the price seems a little high, a little goes a long way with oils like this, so I have a feeling it won't come out to much more than my old moisturizer in the long run."
5487,1,"Nice Flat Iron_My hair looks so much nicer with flat ironing than having it natural. My hair is thin, semi straight with a slight wave to it and easily straightens at 370. I would probably not go higher than 400 degrees because it can really fry your ends. Before using this flat iron I put Avon's heat protectant on and try to leave it on a couple minutes as it dries before applying the hot ceramic plates on it. On draw back is that I have the 1 inch, and would've preferred the 1.5 inch size since it flattens out quicker for longer hair. Overall great price and very pleased with Conair Infiniti Pro line Ceramic Flat Iron."
9919,0,"A Husband's Review:_Got this for my Wife.  She's always been a Hot Tools gal.  She has one of their flat irons & uses that as a curler too.  Thought I'd get some brownie points for gifting what I thought was gonna be a gimme.  Turns out that &#34;it takes forever to heat up&#34; & &#34;curls fall right out after using&#34;.  Anyway, not quite dog house material, but definitely didn't score me any points either.  I guess if you're a guy trying to score points, this ain't it"
980,1,triple ceramic waver_I love my triple barreled waver. it works very great but i thought it would've been bigger. I use it a lot of different occasions & events. its always easy to use and everyone tells me how nice it looks when i use it. Thank you
5136,1,"Absolutely Flawless!_By far the best sunless tanner I have tried thus far in my 20 years of being an avid tanner. I recommend Fake Bake to everyone I know, no matter your skin tone it blends beautifully :)"
7788,1,Great Lotion_I have extremely dry skin which peels in summer and winter! I have been on the look out for a good day and night moisturizer. This one is GOOD. With amazon's fast delivery I am enjoying this lotion very much. It arrived SO SOON. Love the product It goes on so smoothly and instantly hydrates. The pump design is great tooLOVE LOVE LOVE
545,1,"Nice!_I have very curly, frizzy hair.  This is great for my hair, and gives it the moisture it desperately needs."
9848,0,"Not what I was hoping for_This seems like a great idea, and I imagine most women who have spent much time curling their hair have imagined such a device. It turns out, however, that in practice, it's not so great. I tried several times with both roller sizes, varying degrees of hair dampness, and both heat settings to get this to work, but every time it left me with nothing but an irritated scalp.The design is flawed, unfortunately. The air comes out of the base of the wand and goes straight out the other end of the curler. It does not blow through the hair at all. The curler gets hot and that heat does eventually dry the hair (and irritate the scalp), but it doesn't result in nice bouncy curls. After letting the curler cool completely, I took it out and the best case scenario was limp hair with a bit of flip at the end. Usually, though, it was just limp hair. I achieved absolutely zero root lift using this. None at all, no matter which size roller I used.The process to use this is quite slow. Since none of the air actually goes through the hair, it takes a minute or two per roller for the hair to dry and heat up, even if the hair is just lightly dampened. After the hair is finally dried and heated up, you have to leave the roller in until it completely cools. Since there are only six rollers, doing the whole head takes a LONG time.When the hot air is blowing through the roller, the plastic part gets quite hot. If it is against the scalp, it causes irritation and discomfort.If you have a heat glove you MIGHT be able to block off the end of the roller and force the air through the hair, but it doesn't come with a heat glove.I have several Remington products that I love, but this is not one of them. It doesn't deliver on its promise at all."
3385,1,VERY PIGMENTED_All you need is a NYX WHITE base under this and it works wonders. Its minerally so when you are taking the product out it will flake a little bit but thats no trouble. MOST of the shadows are matte and only 3 or more less than 7 are shimmery
3179,1,"A Moisturizing Gel for Your Curls_This is a great gel!  It's alcohol-free, which is always a plus.  You get sooo much product for such a low price!  I have never said this about gel before: It's moisturizing!  I know, right?!  How can that be? I don't know, but I love it.  I use it for wash n go curls and for laying edges down.The texture is quite thick.  Not watery at all. The scent?  Meh. Neither here nor there.  Great hold.  Apply too much.....and you'll regret it!  (That's with anything, though).I am able to apply this to my 4a curls and get gorgeous definition.  It's water soluble, so no reason to shampoo it out.  Just rinse thoroughly, and proceed with co-washing.I don't think it's fair to compare this to the $30 boutique natural gels that are out there.  Those tend to have better ingredients, yes, but they also give a different look.  They give piecier curls...Eco Styler CLUMPS your curls.  It looks more natural, IMO.  It depends on the look you're going for.  I do own the expensive gels, as well.... but THIS HERE is a keeper!It's all about technique when doing wash-n-go's.If you've been using brown gel (ew) try Eco Styler.  You'll love it!"
303,0,"TOXIC CRAP! FRIED MY BEAUTIFUL HAIR. UN-NATURAL COLOR (7G)!!!!!_OMG this product name/claims make it APPEAR to be &#34;natural&#34;, but its made out of horrible chemicals:.... Claims &#34;No Ammonia, No resorcinol, No parabens &#34; So what?...it contains:peg-2 oleamine, aqua (purified watter), cocamide dea, alcohol denat (alcohol), propylene glycol, oleic acid,  ethanolamine, p-phenylenediamine ( TOXIC!! ), sodium sulfite, tetrasodium edta, hydrolized vegetable proteine, sodium erythorbate,  n,n-bis (2-hydroxythyl)-p-phenylenediamine sulfate, 2-amino-4-hydrohyethylaminoanisole sulfate 1 , 4-chlororesorcino...blah, blah, blahIt fried my hair so badly I cannot even brush it. wth. Also, this color has an orange tone. O-R-A-N-G-E.  Like a pumpkin. Only on crack. I would sooner shave my head than EVER use this product again. Naturtint, you are NOT anything near natural, you suck. People, don't use products that can harm you, cause &#34;allergic reaction&#34;, seizures, coma or death. Just the ingredient PPD alone is enough to make me say: Naturtint, you SUCK. DO NOT BUY! DO NOT USE! Unnatural color. Unnatural ingredients! Huge red flags! So glad they claim to not test on animals, but now I look like a damn pumpkin. On crack."
6007,1,"great eye product_i had been searching for an eyelid treatment and Avon delivered! who knew that the good ol' reliable Avon company would have such a stellar product! in a matter of just a few days, the crepey(sp) top eyelid was fading noticeably. Now my eye shadow doesn't look like crumpled paper!  the lower eye cream is fine too, although for my personal taste( I live an very, very arid area) another brand works better for my skin type.this is product is very gentle and doesn't hurt my sensitive eyes as there is no smell! hooray! a little goes a long way so at this price it's a super bargain.please try it and enjoy!"
9301,1,"Orange you glad you bought it?_Okay vitamin C for your face... Hmm, well as a middle-aged male I may not be the target audience for this item but when VIDI offered me the chance to try I thought why not. I'm a biker and my face sees its fair share of weather - hot, cold, sun, snow and rain and I therefore don't have the best skin in the world. I guess my life's travels show visibly on my visage and I'd rather it didn't.I was however extremely skeptical that this product would affect my appearance in anything other than a psychosomatic way but I was wrong and I'm very happy to say that.The one ounce bottle is much larger than you may think and is very nicely designed. The product comes out using a simple pump mechanism and is therefore easy to use and unlike a tub of cream is designed to protect the liquid from the air to aid long term preservation.It smells amazing! Like a thousand oranges had been compressed into a squirt of clear gel and it's silky smooth not greasy or wax-like. Applying it to your face is as simply as gently rubbing it in and it leaves no visible residue although your face will feel very smooth for some time.Now this isn't an exfoliator and you should clean your face thoroughly and dry it before applying this, otherwise you're effectively applying it to dry dead skin and wasting your purchase and will not see the maximum benefit.And after two weeks my face looks rejuvenated. I have to say I wasn't expecting that, and as I said from the outset, I'm a big old biker dude... But I'm going to continue purchasing and using this product because put simply, it works. (Smells amazing too!). Five stars."
6975,1,"Very happy with this cleanser._I got this very specifically for my 17 year old daughter to use. She has mild acne, with some flare-ups throughout the month, and this product has been one she has been pretty happy with, using it on a daily basis. She usually washed her face with this in the morning (she uses something else in the evening) and she feels like it really leaves her skin clean and soft and is not too drying, like some products can be with salicylic acid as the main active ingredient.Also, she loves the pump bottle, very convenient and easy to use!"
4641,1,"Love it_I have only used this product twice since I only recently purchased it. It makes my hair feel soft, smooth and shiny. I only use it once every two weeks as written on the instruction, I can't say anything about hair growth since I have only used it twice and I don't think that is long enough to actually tell. But once I am done with the product I will give another update and see whether or not it helps with hair growth."
6303,1,"Stays put - you won't go back to your old hairbands after trying these_I have thick hair and I like to wear it in a ponytail. So, many of the typical hair bands that I have used are constantly slipping down and sometimes the ponytail band slips right out of my hair. I tried these bands and they really do grip your hair. I only had to adjust this band once during the day to keep my ponytail up high. I have such thick hair, so I was amazed at how well they stayed put throughout a long day of wearing a relatively high ponytail and chasing my kids.You do need to be careful not to yank them out of your hair though, because you will rip some of your hair out. Instead, gently take them out to avoid hair breakage. I will definitely continue to buy these hair bands to keep my pony tails in place!"
8612,1,"Nexxus Youth Renewal_This conditioner is a bit on the thin/runny side, but it does work really well. It conditions and detangles very nicely. It rinses well and does not leave any build up and it doesn't weigh down your hair. I typically prefer a thicker conditioner, but this worked surprisingly well for being so thin. I need a lot of moisturization and really good detangling - this conditioner was perfect for both.I didn't notice any transformation of my hair in regards to the 'Youth Renewal,'  but I still liked this conditioner.The scent is very feminine, but not heavy - sort of a floral smell and it is really nice. It doesn't seem to linger much or stay on the hair long, but that's ok.Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner is a great conditioner overall, even without seeing and drastic changes or improvements to my hair. I would use it again and recommend it."
1442,1,"Good but expensive_Smells great, but expensive!!!! Makes my tummy feel so moisturized! Does not last very long either though which stinks since it smells so good!"
8351,1,"Happy Hubby_I got this for my husband...he usually does not like the shave gear I get him, but loved this...he said it has a nice balance between lotion and sting and that he was impressed with it...Thank you Axe- I will take brownie points any way I can get them"
2414,1,"Great Day Cream for Cold and Dry Weather_This cream goes on smooth, smells pleasant and absorbs quickly. It is a thicker cream, better used for cold temperatures and dry environments, but is not good for a hot day and humidity. I recommend blotting after a few minutes, as there is a slightly oily sheen to the product once absorbed, but blotting and applying a matte foundation immediately remedies the issue. A little goes a very long way, use sparingly. For a lighter option, try Boots No. 7 Moisture Quench Day Fluid. Works like a charm."
2564,1,"Surprisingly uplifting... and a great addition to (dreaded) family gatherings_Treasured Hearts was recommended to me as a 'booster' for an upcoming visit from the in-laws.  I layered it over a nice subtle scent, and trudged bravely onward towards a much dreaded family gathering (where I was completely outnumbered 5 to 1).  I must say, everyone (those around me, anyway) was noticably calmer and less confrontational (which is a normal occurence with this group) and moods were just lighter in general.  The effect was really intriguing - especially considering that just 7 feet away from me I witnessed the usual familial discord going on (but I resisted the temptation to insert myself into THAT group to see if Treasured Hearts could help out.)  I was fine through the entire 3 hour gathering and arrived home unscathed. That in and of itself was nothing short of miraculous.I since have used it in more positive social surroundings too with lovely results... just a nice 'feel good' vibe.  I don't know how the pheromone-magik actually happens, but there is a LOT of evidence for me now that there is indeed something to this science!"
8766,1,"Works well for our curly hair_My daughter and I are biracial and have very, VERY naturally curly hair. It frizzes easily, and nothing really seems to tame the frizz, even when we straighten it. I haven't actually used this product with heat yet, since I just had a baby and I never have the time to blow dry or flat iron. However, this Motions line still manages to to help calm our hair down. The cleanser lathers nicely for us, but only after we strip our hair down some and give it a preliminary wash. We typically do the conditioner-only hair washing, so the fact that it doesn't lather up right away makes me a bit nervous about what else could be causing whatever buildup is there, but I guess that's an issue for a different day!My only complaint is that I think the bottle needs maybe a shrink-wrapped plastic seal. Mine had come loose in transit and there was cleanser all over the bottle and the inside of the package."
7067,1,"Great price, wish it came with a glove_I absolutely love this curler!! I have thick and medium length hair and this curler gives me very pretty waves vs tight curls. I can do variety of hairstyles and I am loving the versatility of it. Comes with a heat protective pouch I wish it came with a glove as well but hey for the price it's a steal!"
3478,1,"Nice, Natural, Mild Body Wash_I like this body wash because it makes a gentle lather rather than sudsing too much, which indicates to me it has less harsh chemicals. It has a mild nice fruit scent.  I don't recognize what alot of the ingredients are but I assume most are more to the natural side and I generally like Nature's Gate products. The portion is huge and lasts a long time. Overall, I like it but don't love it and do recommend it as a quality product."
2689,1,Fragrance free and clean_Love this soap. It is truly fragrance free unlike Ivory which I used most of my life and now has fragrance.  I'm allergic to fragrance so it matters a lot to me that it is clean smelling and without fragrance. Also it doesn't dry your skin which Ivory had a tendency to do.  The downside is that it's a glycerine soap and it tends to go fast but at Amazon prices I can deal with it.
3889,1,"My Favorite TGEO_You'll like this product.  The TGE oils are all genuine and very aromatic!  However you choose to use it you won't be disappointed by the scent.  A little goes a long way.  Orange is my favorite- there's something about citrus that just awakens the senses and boosts energy.  I mix this with everything (almost) lotion, hair products, home made linen freshener (water and Sweet Orange oil), non-scented bath oil an shower gel, candles, and bar soap... LOVE IT!"
6951,1,"Very nice color_This is a lime green color. The formula is great as OPI usually is. My nails were long when I put this color on. After about 5 days I decided to stretch out the wear and put white french tips on and a white design on only 1 nails per hand. Everyone loved it. I'd definitely recommend this color for the BOLD, because only the bold can pull this off! (;"
9805,1,"Try it!_I didn't expect miracles, and I have only used part if the bottle but I do see and feel improvement in my dry skin. I will be fair and try another bottle so I can fairly rate it after a couple months. It will probably be 5 stars then. There is a very slight &#34;food&#34; type odor but it only lasts a very short time."
4420,1,"Amazing colours_I saw some of the reviews and I wasn't sure if I wanted to get this lip lines, however I need it something other than red and pink, so I gave it a go and I am VERY impress, you can use this lip liners with your lipstick- lip gloss or use your lip balm and use them as a filler.They are not creamy so don't except super soft lips BUT they have great color. :-)"
3691,0,Very poor quality_This product is cheaply made... You can not see the line on the eye... the liquid quality is not consistent...Applicator is good. It makes accurate lines but you can not see the lines as they are so fade....It is not true black color..very fade color..need to apply 2-3 coats to make it look visible..Not recommended at all!
6025,1,Yes Part 2_Received this yesterday and waiting for the results with the Mask.It is worth your $$$. Try it out. I can feel my skin is different.
1983,1,"konad m29_This is one of the most popular image plates when I am doing nail designs for my friends and family, since many people seem to like the Hawaiian themed images and flowers especially. The flowers come out extremely clear without any smudging and every little line and details transfers from the image plate to the stamp to the nail without any parts missing."
443,1,"Many uses for this rich, healing cream_I've been using this product for six years and I just can't say enough good things about it.  I love the stuff!Purchased originally to help my daughter with cracks and redness on her knuckles from damage caused by frequent hand washing with anti-bacterial soaps at school, I have found Miracle of Aloe Miracle Hand Repair Cream works for other issues too.My mother's dog developed a yeast infection on his skin, which led him to bite at himself.  His belly was particularly raw, but when we started using this product on it (in conjunction with a blow up collar so he couldn't bite at it... and a gluten free diet), it healed beautifully in a very short time.If I use it after I wash my face at night as a replacement to my regular night time moisturizing cream, my face is soft and hydrated in the morning.  No stickiness or greasiness, just softer and younger feeling.  I use only about a dime size amount for my face and neck, and work it in slowly, starting around my eyes and moving outward and then down my neck.  Amazing stuff!My husband uses this cream on the tips of his fingers to ease cracking that seems to be constant.  When he uses this product twice a day, every day, the cracking disappears.The cream is heavy, but it takes very little to cover a good sized area.  Wherever you use it you will notice improved hydration retention in the skin, as well as softer, smoother texture.  There is a slight odor to the cream, but it's pleasant and not perfume-y.With 60% Aloe, it heals naturally.  I don't always go for natural products, but this one truly works extremely well, and is fairly priced considering you need very little of this rich cream to get the job done.I highly recommend this cream to heal and/or improve the quality of their skin.  Those having issues with dry, rough, chapped, cracked skin on any part of their body will most appreciate the quick relief offered by this product.NOTE:  I have also tried theMiracle of Aloe Miracle Foot Repair Cream 8 Oz As Seen On TV Guarantees to Repair Dry, Cracked Feet & Heels! Helps Stop Itching & Unpleasant Odors Quick, Fast, Easy and Completely Painless! Contains 60% Ultra Aloe, All Natural Formula. Penetrates Deep T...which works very well too.  Just a tad thicker than this one, but it seems to be essentially the same formulation."
2154,1,"Favorite moisturizer ever_I have oily skin, so it's difficult to find a moisturizer that is well balanced. The texture of this moisturizer is so velvety smooth and luxurious. I also love the smell and actually look forward to putting it on in the morning. This product helps to keep my skin balanced and leaves no shiny finish. Also, I have milia underneath the inner corners of my eyes (little ugly bumps that are impossible to remove unless you lance them x_x) so I dab this underneath my eyes and it smooths the bumpy skin there! It's an awesome eye cream as well. I don't think I can live without this product &lt;3"
7382,1,"Headbands_These are cute and are very sturdy.  They are tight, but not so tight that I end up with a headache 10 minutes later.  The teeth help to keep the headband in place all day.  Love that it comes in brown and black as to pretty much match everything."
8365,1,"Great Plates_These are absolutely amazing for the price. Best deal I have seen for the amount of plates you get. Went looking for stamping kit when I saw the &#8220;As seen on Tv&#8221; one, received this and I am excited to try out all the different designs. It works good. Receive several compliments on my nails when I have the stamp designs on them. Everyone wants to know how I did it."
9725,1,Caress Juicy Escape!_This is one body wash that I am completely in love with. By looking at the yellow bottle and its contents you would think it was some sort of lemon scent but it's actually grapefruit and smells delicious. It leathers really well and leaves skin feeling cleansed and moisturized.
4387,1,"Prefer over all others_This sunscreen works great and I feel better about using it because it doesn't have a bunch of bad stuff in it. I reviewed a lot of other products before purchasing this one. it is a bit thick of course and requires some rubbing in but it does work. It can leave a bit of a white film but I've come to realize that that is to be expected from more natural products. I'd rather put this on our baby than something with chemicals in it. My husband does not like the smell of it, he says it smells like metal... well, it does because of the ingredients but I don't mind the smell. With a lovely flowery scent comes the chemicals that made it that way. I have not found it to come off easily after applied to where we've experienced a sunburn but we have not used it over a 6 hour period to test it further than that. I'm sure it would need to be re-applied at that point. I would recommend it and buy it again. I actually use it on my face too."
95,0,Total waste of Money!_How can people market such crap. It does nothing. Absolutely nothing. Total waste of money. I have tried alot of eye creams. This one is right there on the bottom.
2957,1,"Great starter set without breaking the bank._Great starter set without breaking the bank. There are A lot of brush sets on amazon but i saw a makeup tutorial on YouTube and these were advised by the video's guru after she had disastrous luck looking for good quality brushes on amazon.these have a majority of the brushes i was looking for but buying a few solo brushes isn't a big deal.If you get this i would recommend getting a pencil brush because this set doesn't have onealso the case kinda smelled funny when i received it in the mail, however i didn't use the case(brushes are worth the crap case)"
8497,1,"Helps with Dandruff and Great Hold as always from Axe_My son likes Axe products so this product was tested by him. His first comments were about the smell- he really lobes the smell, its very fresh.  It doesn't dry and leave flakes either in your hair or when it comes out. It has a nice hold, not to heavy and easy to style. You only need a small amount though - he used to much a few times and really had to work it in otherwise you see the white from the product in your head. It seems to help with the dandruff, we've had no issues or complaints there. It says you can apply it several times a day. We have only used it once a day in the mornings. We applied it midday but saw no difference- no worse no better. But perhaps if you have a worse case of dandruff I can see applying it several times a day and seeing how it works."
8337,1,"Great for manly men!_What man wants to use face wash? This one! It has a great smell, texture and cooling sensation as you would expect from Axe. It foams up well and is not too strong on my sensitive skin."
98,1,"Growing on me_I don't usually wear makeup, as it's not really a good fit for my occupation. I decided to try this out, and I like the way it works. It doesn't leave my lashes think or clumpy. The company has fast shipping and great packaging."
2372,1,"Necessary and great for after neutralizer, shower and TCA peel._Liked it for after the TCA peel.  Not as much for after the Lactic peel...but that is just my personal opinion."
4905,1,Make and repairs_Ive use this a few time and it has my hair controllablily soft and the style last for days. Also decreased dandruff.
7461,0,"Used once, wont finish the bottle But it might just be me_Disclaimer- my hair is keratin treated and may not be representative.First, I recognize that the shampoo and conditioner claim to make stronger hair in 7 days and that I didn't use it for that time. But I don't feel that the immediate downsides of this product make trying for a long term benefit a good idea.My hair is fine and quite long (well past the bra line). It is also keratin treated. Like most people with long hair I care a great deal about it and put quite a bit of effort into it's care. I was excited to try this product.After using the matching shampoo, I applied this conditioner.  The shampoo had left my hair feeling stripped and I was hoping this would fix it.  The conditioner was light and smelled good.  I left it in for several minutes.  When I rinsed it out, I was disappointed to find that my hair still felt dry and stripped.  I rinsed it thoroughly and let it air dry. My hair was a tangled mess.  I ended up needing to use my daughters detangling spray and brush it out very carefully to avoid breaks.While this product is meant to be used over time to gain results one of the biggest things to avoid with long hair is dry tangly hair. A long term gain is not worth the short term breaks and snaps that will occur due to tangling."
9945,1,"Finally a comfortable eye mask for sleeping on the plane!_I bought myself what was supposed to be an incredibly comfortable eye mask for sleeping on the plane last year.  It was thick with a beautiful fabric design, and small fabric bulges under the eyes themselves to elevate the mask off of the eyelid.  I tried the mask on several of my red eye flights and it was uncomfortable!  I just about gave up on eye masks until I tried these excellent masks from the Friendly Swede.  First, the mask has 2 straps (not just 1 like my other) which enables a bit more of a custom fit around the head.  Second, the mask is moulded to completely block light while not touching your eyes.  It is soft and comfortable while simultaneously keeping a strong enough shape that it doesn't collapse onto the eyelid.  It is well designed and manufactured.  As a bonus, you get ear plugs and a nice carrying case.  Highly recommended for frequent travelers and red-eye flyers!Note: I received a free sample for the purposes of review."
9514,1,"Power to the Child_I know this may seem silly, but I am constantly battling my son about his hair. He just does not care. Brush... wash... cut... does not care. I got this on a whim, that maybe if it was marketed toward a kid he would let me help him with his fly away, static hair. It worked! He loved it. He wanted me to show him how to do it himself and that little bit of power has changed so much. I am guessing he just needed to feel that he was in more control. AND, no more fly aways, the product does what it says and so much more. I am unsure if it will have the same effect on other children, but this product has allowed my son to take control of his own grooming and he feels better about his looks and himself."
8481,1,"Spiky!_For me, 'Axe Spiking Glue Spiked Up Look' is the perfect hair gel.  I have short hair that I spike up on top, and since I found Axe I haven't gone with anything else.  It is easy to apply, doesn't feel nasty on my head like other 'glues' I have tried, and keeps my hair spiked up all day long.It's really powerful stuff--I live in Seattle, which means hats when I'm outside for most of the year. Through some miracle of industrial engineering, this 'Spiking Glue' doesn't squish down into a flat helmet head under my hat.  I can get to work, take my hat off, and still look cool. That's an impressive feat for a hair gel.This is my first time using the tube-style instead my usual, theAxe Charged Spikedup Look Putty Jar.  They call one a 'Spiked Up Look Glue' and one a 'Spiked Up Look Putty,' but I couldn't tell any difference between them other than the containers. The tube is convenient, takes up less space in the bathroom cabinet (because it stands upright), and allows you to squeeze out only what you need. On the other hand, with the jar you can be sure that you are using 100% of the product you paid for--there is no rolling up the toothpaste tube to try and squeeze those last few drops out.  Also, if you accidentally take more than you need, with the jar you can put it back.  Not so much with the tubeAll-in-all, I think I like the jar-style better for home use, and the tube is awesome if you are taking a trip. Either way, Axe's 'Spiked Up Look' is the hair product for me!"
5502,1,Great Product!_This is a wonderful brush which appears to be gentle!!!  Love using it to massage my scalp in a circular motion also.  Thanks much. :-)
2809,1,A good body moisturizer_A very nice product for winters. It soothes skin and smells nice. The moisturizer works well and holds for enough time.
2394,1,"Do yourself a big favor and start using this_Some wonderful things to say about these products.  First of all this brand, Cosmetic Solutions, is the EXACT same thing as the more expensive(much more expensive)one.  Since I have been using this C+E Serum my skin looks FANTASTIC.  My complexion is bright, glowing and refreshed.  My friends have noticed.  I use less make up now because my skin looks so great.  I also really like the Hydrating B5 gel.  It feels great on.  You might not think you are getting any hydration because it does not feel like a cream but your skin will be well hydrated because it soaks in.  But it is not meant to replace moisturizer.  I am so glad I found Cosmetic Solutions."
1229,1,MMMM Fruityluscious!_This perfume has a slight fruity slight musk scent.  It smells really good!  The scent is lasting.  I just got it in the mail today and it's evening now and it still leaves a scent and it's not nauseating or sweet.  I like this better than Live which I got early this week!
8305,1,"Hard to beat, even by more $$$ brands_You cannot beat the price on this, even if it means an extra step.  You wash with the Moroccan shampoo, then use this for several minutes (no middle step of add'l conditioner like Tresemme does).  Rinse it and then you can use the Moroccan oil shine for a finish.The price for all three was under $10, which is less than I used to pay for Redken or Biosilk.  The products smell great and don't feel oily like some oil additive shampoos.I can't praise this enough. I've sampled several this few months and this is what I buy now."
3748,0,Not sure if this was authentic Benefit Coralista Blush_I've used &#34;Coralista&#34; for years but when I received this the box was a different color which I just thought the company must have adjusted the color but then the actual blush was way too pink.  Amazon gave me a credit as the seller never replied.
3433,1,"Nice Product_I am in the process of transitioning over to 'natural' make-up products. This was the first blush that I have tried that I liked. Several of the 'powder' types were too pale (no pigment), drying, or messy (loose mineral powders).  The color of this one is just right for my skin (a real bright pinky color) & it layers nicely. (I am a fair skinned person with combination skin.) I noticed no smell to the product whatsoever. I did not notice any stickiness or greasiness - but I think it would not be suitable for someone with truly oily skin. It has a nice shimmer. I am very satisfied with it & will purchase other colors."
5522,1,"Lovely!_I love this body wash. It smells wonderful, is great at cleansing and moisturizing my sensitive skin, and is not too expensive. I also like it because it does not contain parabens, which I'm trying to reduce/eliminate from my skin care regimen. This is my favorite scent, but I have also used the St. Ives Mineral Therapy body wash and been quite happy with it. I recommend this highly!"
8787,1,"Thick Cream with SPF20_I am very sensitive to scent, especially anything on my face as it will irritate my eyes.  I was worried about the strong perfume like scent this cream had but it didn't bother my allergies or affect my eyes.It is as thick as the old fashioned cold cream used to be and you have to massage it into your skin  for awhile.  Once it is on, it feels light, not heavy.  It doesn't appear greasy either.  It does make your skin feel softer and more hydrated.  However, the package suggests that you reapply it every two hours if you are outdoors or active.  I didn't think that would be necessary but I did feel the dryness return to my skin after two hours and had to reapply.  If you have applied foundation or powder over it, then that isn't going to work unless you clean your face and reapply everything again.  Since I don't wear foundation or powder if I am not going anywhere special, it worked alright for me.  I do appreciate how it does plump and moisturize the skin."
3438,1,"Olay 10 Stars!_The Olay Regenerist DNA Superstructure UV Cream is wonderful. The name speaks for itself, it's a moisturizer that helps restore firmness and also includes spf 25 to prevent everyday sun damage. Olay Regenerist DNA is strong and clears cases of dry skin in days, not weeks or months like other creams.I absolutely love this cream, it's light and doesn't leave you with a heavy oily feeling. Also because it's so light it's easy to apply makeup on afterwords without much hassle. If I could give this 10 stars I would because it's the best moisturizer I have ever tried. I would highly recommend it!"
1295,1,"good even for male with short hair._ok, this is incredible, works like magic, better than anything i ever tried before in my life, and bealive me i tried a lot of stuff, OHHH by the way im a male, with short hair, so i just used this kit, no shampoo, or anything like that of the same brand like u suposse to do, but still worked well, i ll buy more for sure,"
6508,1,"excellent product_i used this because of my difficulty getting in and out of the tub.  i needed to wash my hair more often and this did an excellent job.  then my granddaughter used it after ear surgery.  she was very pleased.  since  she is 12, you can see that any kind of approval means a lot!"
9037,1,"Good Exfoliate_Gloves are large in size, but get the job done.  I would prefer them with a loop ring for hanging and a slimmer design, they get you through shower time, feeling refreshed."
1137,1,"Good product_I love using this product, and for me it's the best product when blow drying my hair, curling and ironing my hair."
2761,1,"Dermatologist recommended_I've been using this for years, as per recommendation.  I have very sensitive skin and this works well.  I like the weight and SPF, and it absorbs quickly for morning routine."
6578,1,The Hottest Colors and Affordable!_High end packaging with superior quality products to give you the most excellent manicure. The hottest colors that dry quickly and cover well with only one coat. The neon colors are fun too! The easy to hold bottle design comes in handy also.
8596,1,"Yes_My wife used these, but pretty much feels the same way I do about the ones for men.  Better than the models you have to buy replacement blades for, and has very slick and painless action.  Makes legs nice for rubbing your face all over."
8627,1,"nexxus shampoo for seniors does the job_this shampoo is supposed to make your hair feel younger, replenised and volumized.  i doubt any shampoo can fulfill that promise. the hair on your head is no longer living. it is only the part embedded in your scalp which is alive. so these claims to chemically rejuvenate something which is dead are impossible.  what these products can do and this one does is clean your hair while not stripping it of oils.  it is the oil in your hair which makes it manageable.  but if there is too much oil, it feels dirty to you. so the trick is to clean it just enough so that oils are still there and that your hair can be styled with ease (aka is volumized). overly clean hair with no oil residue is fly away and silky.so if you shampoo senior hair just once with this product, it will be perfectly clean yet have enough oil left for your hair to fall into place, assuming it is cut well.  this is not an easy feat and many products or double shampooing with this product, will strip your hair of those oils.can this be done cheaper?  i have bought a lot of shampoos over the years,  I find that the ones which do this job best do tend to be on the higher end,if you are a younger person, you already have tons of oil in your hair and this shampoo is not for you."
4560,1,"Good concealer_Useful product.  Just need to use it sparingly, as it can be too much.  Good coverage and texture, for the price."
7237,0,"Quality is lacking_Quality is lacking - these they fell apart without even using them, the entire metal tip falls off NOT a good deal."
6298,1,"Wonderful way to wake up_Until now, I really didn't give any thought to aromatherapy products and their specified purpose. I enjoy lavender at night but never felt like it put me to sleep. Chamomile tea is delicious but it never made me feel more relaxed.But THIS stuff- the orange ginger smell is amazing. I suds up my hands and inhale really deeply (like yoga breaths) four or five times and it really makes me feel clear headed and relaxed. My one year old son can be throwing toys into the shower, drag towels around the bathroom, bang on the cabinets and otherwise cause his usual mayhem and I swear... breathing this stuff in is so refreshing.Additionally, it is INCREDIBLY creamy on the skin. I was not expecting that at *all* since most clear body washes are water/alcohol/fragrance and wash away instantly. This one is thick and so moisturizing. I will never let it run out!!! Oh, and you can usually get it a couple dollars cheaper on Amazon. If you have Prime, buy it here! Save yourself the trip to the mall."
7756,0,"made me look undead_I have oil prone very fair porcelain skin. I ordered This product in #2; It dries very very quickly and is very hard to spread out. I enjoyed the way it made my skin a little bit lighter, but in certain lights it seriously looked like I was wearing clown makeup. This product also settled into my fine lines.The benefits here were that it did a fairly good job at controlling oil, and there is a TON of product. I used it for a few weeks and it looked completely untouched. While I did not like it, I gave it to my also fair/oily skinned bf and she loves it.I also tried the Holika Holika Clearing BB alongside this one and I enjoy it much more. It's way easier to apply, the oil control is better, it doesn't make me look like I'm dead, and it does not settle into my fine lines. It does not come with near as much product, but it is usually a little cheaper so that's not a big deal."
9244,1,"Convenient and easy to apply_Banana Boat for Men Triple Defense Spray SPF 30 worked perfectly while mowing the acreage for hours.  No signs of sunburn, no itchy or greasy feeling residue and has a pleasant scent.  I will be buying this as a regular purchase."
175,1,"It Works!_If you have problems with extreme dry skin, please buy this product. A friend has chemo and the hands were really feeling awful and flaking and painful. Applying this balm solved the problem! It works:)"
9760,1,Wonderful serum for your skin_I really like this serum.  I am very cautious of what I put on my skin and I read about a product before I use it.  I did not have any worries with this product.  It leaves my skin so smooth and soft.  I had an event I went to an people were remarking about how beautiful my skin was and that I was glowing and wanted to know what I was doing.  You know sometimes you don't want to share your secrets but this is such an awesome product that I didn't mind sharing.  The product is not to thin or heavy it is just right.  No over powering scent and it is just lovely.  I would recommend this product to others.
9086,1,"Helps my hair dry fast_I use Turbie Twist every time I wash my hair.  My hair gets dry a lot faster than when I used a towel.  I can think of only one improvement... it needs to be longer, because my hair is getting too long to fit inside it.  Guess I'll have to fold my hair up a few times and put it in when it outgrows the length of the turbie twist."
5600,1,"nice quality, large selection_only thing that would have been nice were tips to using concealer, and maybe a choice of all fair colors or all darker colors, and no yellow concealer only green, purple and sparkly highlighter and a bunch of skin colors."
3108,1,"Pimple, meet your death!_UPDATE Feb 10th, 2012:I still use this almost every day. It is my favorite facial product, simply because I don't get as much of any acne these days, but when I do get the occasional redness of a pimple show up, I just roll some of this over it. It has a cool, not warm, feeling to it when you roll it on. Gradually, you see the redness fade away over the course of a few days, and the skin returnsback to normal with no scarring. Great touch up tool. I stand by my recommendation.-----------------------------------------------------------Being a young adult, pimples occasionally pop up on my face. Sometimes more than others. With this product, I can touch up pimples or spots of inflammation, and I ALWAYS see results. Sometimes results are instant, but sometimes it's more gradual (it depends on what you have to work on).For smaller pimples and whatnot, I would suggest carefully popping them (note: the more inflamed the pimple, the less you should try popping them) and then applying this magic stuff to the spot to heal overnight.Basically, this stuff goes on ANY inflamed bit of skin to HEAL it. This applies to pimples, razor bumps, insect bites, or cuts. It will definitely speed up healing time and minimize scarring to almost nothing.~~~~~~ It is by far the BEST spot treatment (acne/pimples) tool I've ever used! ~~~~~~"
1553,1,"Not antistatic but I like it anyway._It's a good brush.I can feel it massages scalp better than my drugstore bought Revlon nylon pin brush.I find it is not any more or less antistatic than any other regular brush.So I do not really buy into all this ionic deal.I still like it.It is well made,looks nice and does not get dirty or maybe I just harder to see dirt on it :)"
4668,1,"An excellent everyday face cleanser_I love how well this cleanser removes toxins and impurities, and the way it makes my skin feel after a shower.  The only downfall is that the jar is tiny and if you use it everyday it won't last long.  Image is an amazing brand, specifically the Vital C line, but it is pricey and the bottle should be twice the size for the money."
2040,1,"Works well for me_I think the price point is perfect to begin with.  It does have a strong smell but it does say 'caffeine'.  It goes on smooth and soaks in easy, no greasy & does not clog pores or hurt eyes.  I also like the fact that all the ingredients are familiar to me.  I recommend it."
6568,1,"Excellent value, but a little thick_The other reviewers are correct, these crystal files are a bit too thick. But the thickness doesn't hamper the filing function, which is excellent. The colors are terrifically cute. And there's no arguing about the price. These are a STEAL!"
1691,1,Great Buy. Strengthens and softens hair_This product smells soo good. My hair felt soo soft and clean. My hair feels soo much stronger and healthier.
6095,1,"Great product_All the Holika Holika Petit BB creams are great, honestly.This one is a bit clear, but after a few minutes it adapts to the colour of your skin, like the 3 other I've tried.Really easy and nice to apply, and it smells lovely too hehe~~Makes a very nice and luminous complexion and moisturize well.The price is very reasonnable for 30 ml.I bought it from A-Poly and the transaction was great. The parcel arrived earlier than when it was supposed to, and they have even put some samples!"
4569,1,"really does work_At first I started using a full pump, but it was way too much for my needs and I developed painful breasts.  I cut back to 1/4th of a pump am & pm and that is just about right for my needs.  I know it works because when I was taking too much I developed breast tenderness.  When I don't use it at all I get hot flashes.  The trick is to figure out what amount will work for you, so watch your symptoms and keep track of how much you are using so you can make adjustments as needed.  To figure out how much to use (since I'm not using a full pump), I used a permanent marker to make small lines on the sides of the pump to indicate half a pump, 1/4 and 3/4 pumps - that helps me know how far to depress the pump to get the right amount for my needs."
4315,0,"Way too much perfume_I did not get to use this product long enough to determine its efficacy because the smell was way to overpowering. I felt like I could just dab some on my neck and use it as a daily perfume. I figured anything with that much perfume couldn't be good for my skin. Besides, I found it highly irritating to be bombarded by this overpowering scent ages after I had applied it. I am not a perfume wearer and I did not intend to have my face cream make me into one."
1007,1,"Staple in my Skin-Care Routine_I've been using this lotion paired with a benzyl peroxide (10%) cream for months now with fantastic results.My acne story:When I was 18, my GYN suggested birth control for regulation of my menstrual cycle. A few months after beginning, my face began to break out. It progressively got worse and I consulted a doctor. I tried lots of Rx, but nothing would consistently work because the birth control was causing hormonal problems. I tried ProActiv after I gave up the Rx acne meds. No luck. I suffered from acne for a few years until recently. I just turned 22 and my face is so much better. I stopped taking my birth control medication about 8 months ago. Subsequently I tried ProActiv with little success (I went through almost 3 months of use before I gave up on that). I decided to try a drugstore brand acne system called AnceFree. This worked to kick-start my skin's recovery! AcneFree helped SO much! After I used for about 2 months with fantastic results, I switched to a gentle cleanser (CervaVe), this Neutrogena face lotion, and a 10% benzyl peroxide cream (they all work the same). This has been my system ever since. This 1.7oz tube has lasted me 3 months so far with twice daily use all over the face.The bottom line:I highly recommend this lotion, if you are willing to give it time to work. No acne medication is going to clear your face within a week, or even two weeks. You MUST give the products time to work! Sometimes, like ProActiv for me, they just don't work. This stuff is around $7 for a tube, so there isn't much to lose. Unlike ProActiv which is almost $50 a month. There is no harm in giving this a try.TIPS:+Do not use anything else with salicylic acid in it+Do not use anything with salicylic acid in it with a Rx acne medication+Use a GENTLE cleanser+Wash twice daily only+Wash for two minutes at night (your face has more gunk on it than in the morning)+MAKE-UP WEARERS: Remove makeup with a wipe or olive oil (fantastic for makeup removal AND scar healing) BEFORE CLEANSING! No cleanser will get all your makeup off, which can cause your pores to constantly become clogged.+HANDS AWAY FROM THE FACE!+GIVE YOUR SKIN TIME TO REACT! Skin has a long cell-renewal cycle, so results can take time."
7787,1,"Love, love, love_I tried a sample as a Bzz Agent for a few days and went right out to buy a full-size product. I have dealt with dry skin for a couple of years and have struggled to find a product that truly hydrates my skin and not just layer grease on top. This is fabulous!! I love the smell. I love the way it smoothes onto my skin but is absorbed quickly to make applying makeup easier. My only complaint about the day cream is not having SPF, but it is easy for me to add one right on top."
570,1,"Really good stuff!_I read all the reviews of this product -- both good and bad. I decided to take the chance and try it for myself. My hair is long, curly and color-treated. I've tried just about every shampoo and conditioner out there, and I'm always in the market for something new to get the extreme tangles out of my hair when I wash it. (I admit that I like to switch products to avoid build-up.)I am 100% satisfied with WEN Fig Cleansing Conditioner. It cleans efficiently without making my hair feel stripped of natural oils. I rinsed it out very thoroughly and did not feel the need to apply more as a conditioner. That, in itself, is amazing because I can never go without conditioner. The end result -- when my hair was dry, I could run my fingers through it without pulling or snagging. My hair has a light, fresh scent -- not as strong as the product's smell direct from the bottle, which is strong and fruity with an added note of a 'soapy' smell.This is a hair product that I'll definitely purchase again, and I highly recommend that you give it a try!"
6824,1,"Worth the Price_Konad plates are definitely worth the money you spend on them. The detail is amazing and the result is breathtaking when you use the Konad polish.A couple of things:I do have the metal scraper and it leaves superficial scratches on the plate. However, it does not mar the design.The images are a tight fit if you have large nails. I have long nail beds and wear an &#34;active-length&#34; nail and can juuust get the image on my middle finger. I have to double stamp my thumb.I would give them 4 stars for sizing, but the images are just wow. Try one :-)"
8223,1,"I tried it today and long story short, I loved it!_I tried it today and long story short, I loved it!  I recommend this lotion to everyone. This was my first time tanning and my first tan ever and I literally shocked my friends when i came out!!Not only does it smells decliious but it has some really attractive ingredients and i got a nice bronze and dark tan. Def recommend."
3129,1,"perfect for my skin_Not thick and greasy, perfect for my skin!"
5772,1,Great blending tool!_I love to use this brush after I have put on foundation and set with powder.  Gives a very smooth and well-blended finish.
8216,1,"Good Facial Lotion_After two days of using this product, my facial dry skin has definitely improved. I also have had a noticeable decrease in oiliness while wearing it.  This lotion goes on very easily and soaks in nicely without being greasy; my face feels soft and smooth while wearing it.  I have sensitive skin, but have had no reaction to this.  Overall, despite not testing it for sun protection, I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it unhesitatingly.Edit: After getting rid of allergies, I can smell a light scent to the lotion when I apply it.  It goes away very quickly, though."
9085,1,"Does the job_I really like these discs, I just wish you could get more uses out of them. Each disc is good for 2 uses. It leaves my face glowing. Just do not put too much pressure because you can sand your skin off. lol"
2041,1,"Skin recovery miracle_I bought this for my combination skin. It does well to quench the skin without clogging pores or getting too oily. I do microdermabrasion treatments with chemical peels, so this really helps my skin as an overnight lotion. You can use it under makeup, and a little goes a long way, so you don't have to use much. I would recommend using it in place of your regular day or night moisturizer after toners and serums. I couldn't read the directions because none were in English and my German is lacking."
3254,1,If you want soft hair_I love this oil a little goes a long way too. The smell is a little annoying but it's worth it.
3219,1,Great remover_I'm glad I bought this nail remover saw it on YouTube and had to buy it works great fantastic plan to buy more!
1129,0,HORRIBLE_FLIMSEY/CHEAPLY MADE/DULL/DON'T CUT CUTICLE/CUMBERSOME/HORRIBLE QUALITY/I am surprised that Revlon would have such a poor item for sale on Amazon !  DO NOT RECOMMEND
5058,1,"Amazing Conditioner_This leave-in conditioner is amazing, it moistens and keeps the hair moist. I use it weekly and I have no complaints. It also have an amazing scent, a fresh-clean scent."
5111,1,"Great!_I've used Organix shampoos for years, and love them all. I've tried the coconut, teatree mint, acai berry avocado, cherry blossom ginseng, and vanilla. All have been great. I have hair that is fine but thick, long, and slightly wavy. It's not chemically treated. I'm picky about shampoo, since I wash it everyday, and don't want to dry out my hair and I hate any residue, as it makes my hair very oily. These are the best shampoos though, as I've found that they really clean my hair without being overly harsh. I also like that they don't contain parabens/sulfates.Teatree is especially good, since it's excellent for balancing scalp/hair. It's good for anyone, but I'd also recommend it for anyone with mild dandruff. It also great, very refreshing and minty."
1890,1,happy_great product  since buying this shampoo my hair is regrown more and alot thicker  aim happier and i will buy it again!
7525,1,"gorgeous, glassy protection!_I recently started getting fancy with my nails. I purchased a nail stamping kit, stamping plates, dotting tools, rhinestones, nail glue, 500 fake nails, and a BUNCH of new nail polish. Some of the nail polish didn't dry very nicely, looking matte instead of shiny. Nearly all of the nail polish I purchased was less than $1.50 a bottle, so it was by no means high quality. However, I am just not willing to spend more than a couple dollars for a bottle of nail polish, especially when you buy so many different colors. It adds up! At first, I was reluctant to purchase Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat because I really didn't want to spend the money if it wasn't going to work.  Plus, I am used to cheap stuff.  I was previously using Sally Hansen, and I am not even sure if it was a top coat or a clear nail polish. Either way, it did not look good. Maybe it was old, but the color of the liquid actually looked a little yellowed. It also would make my nail polish bleed; I would see my nail polish color on the brush no matter how long I let the polish dry before applying the top coat. I am so glad I found this on Amazon and gave in and bought it. It is absolutely worth it.. Seche Vite dries extremely quickly, and SO shiny; I actually thought my nails were still wet because of the shine, and was shocked that it had dried THAT shiny. Seche Vite makes your nails look beautifully glassy, and helps to hide any imperfections. I also applied a couple of coats of Seche Vite under my nail polish, where my nail had torn about 1/4 way across. The tear was quite far down, and would have been painful to remove. This helped keep my nail from ripping the rest of the way off until I could find my nail glue. I also used Seche Vite to stick and seal on rhinestones, using one coat to stick the rhinestone on, and a second coat over the nail and rhinestone to keep it on. It worked great, since it made it stick without clouding the rhinestone, or leave any residue like glue could have. I really love this top coat and wonder how I ever did my nails without it! People who do nail art should definitely invest in this item so your art can last longer and look professional without the cost!  The 2 pack is a great value!"
9191,1,"I'm loving this lactic acid peel!_This lactic acid peel is awesome. I am used to using peels and I know that some can be weak sometimes, but Dr. Song's peel is definitely one of the best i've ordered on amazon. I promised my skin was glowing the next day. Its strong so follow the directions carefully. I can't wait until I can do my next peel. You must wait at least a week so don't over do it. I will be recommending this peel to friends and I will reorder in the future."
8813,1,"don't get too excited, but still really nice_This color looks really pretty from how they take it in the pics but it doesn't look as good in real life. But it it's a nice color don't get me wrong! I've gotten a lot of complements even when I thought it wasn't that good."
4643,1,Love it_Love it
253,0,"Not enough moisture to solve Colorado Hands._I used to buy this and use it without lucky.  Seems like when I lived in San Francisco it did the trick, but in dry arid Colorado the product isn't rich enough.  I could put it on 3-5 times a day and it didn't help.  I switched to an organic macadamia nut oil product called Bee Nuts and have had great luck with it."
9199,1,"Very pretty and functional._From the first time I used this beautiful hair clip, til the end of the day, I received a lot of compliments. Big and bold is what I call it. The clip itself is strong and holds a lot of my hair and is very heavy in weight. I hope to do business with these wonderful people. They really put out a great product."
1339,1,"Great for mixing my face masks_I make my own masks, the latest being organic manuka honey and essential oils.  These are perfect for scooping the manuka honey from the jar, for stirring the mask ingredients together, and then after refrigerating the mask, for scooping it out to use."

9900,1,"Works Better Than Any Shampoo That I've Ever Tried_I was given a bottle of this shampoo for free in exchange for my honest review. All of the opinions expressed here are solely my own.Product shipped fast and in brand new condition.I don't normally like to use shampoos on my hair because practically all of the ones that I've tried have dried my hair out or left it limp and just feeling gross. Also, they strip the much needed oils from my hair--I have very curly hair, in case you didn't already know...I usually just use conditioners or a shampoo bar &#60;------which is more natural as a shampoo and contains essential oils to moisturize and cleans the hair well. I think that conditioner cleans my hair just as well, in my opinion and actually detangles and adds volume to my curls.I have been extremely happy with all of the other products that I have been using from Adovia so I had a good feeling that this product was going to be something good to try.Sure enough, after using this shampoo a few times, (I only use it when my hair gets really sweaty after a workout), I was genuinely happy with the results.When I use it I massage a bit into my wet hair while I'm showering and let it sit until I'm done washing my body. The reason that I do this is because I want to allow those essential minerals that are in it to sit. I want my hair to absorb the minerals as much as possible. Now, the bottle doesn't say that you have to do this, nor does any shampoo that I have ever used, but I have found that this works best for me.What I do like, which may come as a surprise, is the fact that I don't really feel the need to use a conditioner after using this shampoo! It must be due to the fact that it has olive oil and chamomile in it. It softens my curls and leaves them very clean and there is a slight cool, refreshing feeling on my scalp, very slight, but it's there.The only thing that I really wish was different is that it doesn't have much of a scent. I think that if it had a minty or a citrus scent in it, I might like it even more. I love the way it leaves my hair looking and feeling, but if it left it smelling amazing too--I'd probably never try another shampoo again! Actually, I don't plan on using any other shampoo for now because it really does make my curls look pretty!Glad to know that is just another Adovia product that I wish I had learned about sooner. As for the price of $23, I do think that it should sell for slightly cheaper but it really does work better than any other liquid shampoo that I have tried.Yes I recommend! And although I don't have dandruff, if I did I would love to try this to see how well it would work!"
7838,1,It works great.._It works great...it doesnt look like the bottle in the picture...its a brand! But it works well easy to blend with and soft. Love it!
8268,1,"Much better than expected_My sensitive skin has become very skeptical of any name-brand company offering 'sensitive' face-care products. It seems like they're all loaded with fragrances and harsh chemicals that burn my face red rather than moisturize. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this new product from Dove is actually agreeing with my fair pretty well. And it's not even that greasy!Here's my pros and cons:PROS:- Compatible with my sensitive skin. Haven't noticed any redness or chemical burns- SPF 15 - Not great, but better than nothing- You can feel the hydration- Non greasy- Hasn't caused break-outsCONS:- Slightly strange scent- Feels a little weird. Almost kingly, kinda oily.. you just have to remember that it doesn't look the way it feels- Small mount (1.69 oz won't last long)OVERALL: Although I still prefer my jojoba oil for an overnight moisturizer, I'm starting to seriously become a fan of this new Dove product. It's very hard for me to find a moisturizer that is both non-greasy, won't make me break out, and contains an SPF. I give it a solid 4 stars."
1271,1,Vitamin E Moisturizer Cream_The moisturizer cream works well so far and the price is right. It does moisturize and the vitamin E is supposed to be good for the skin.
6360,1,"Nice base & top coat_I've used both the Shellac and Gelish top and base coat.  I really like the Shellac brand for ONE reason: they are so thin.  The Gelish base and top coat that I have are very thick and its hard to get a thin coat.  Thick coats become full of bubbles while they cure and are just terrible.  The Shellac gives me the nice thin coat I expect to get and I love it.  I find the same is true with the colored polishes, Gelish are thick and tricky to apply and Shellac are thinner and easier to apply/cure.  I'll only buy Shellac from now on...."
1178,1,"Absolutely AMAZING!!!_I had never used anything to apply makeup with, before buying this. My best friend is a FREAK about her makeup (literally has her own room to house it all), she recommended this to me. You run water over it, while squeezing it. It plumps up to 3 x's it's size and you leave it slightly damp. I use SKIN79 BB Cream (pink label) with this sponge and my face looks photo shopped. Use the fattest part of the sponge for your face and the pointy bit to get in the corners of your eyes and nose. I DAB on my makeup with the sponge, not SWIRL or SPREAD, because apparently you need to press the makeup in to your skin. I think this little trick is what allows that photo shopped look. I hope this helps!"
6157,1,"Nail stuff._Bought this for my daughter and she likes it, its a little hard to cut the pieces thin enough to put on your nails though."
1988,1,very good cream but too expensive here_i usually buy this cream in whole foods but i wanted to see how much it cost here...buy it at whole foods! its cheaper and no shipping costs! but i wanted to review the cream itself cuz i love it and have been using it for years..
8007,1,"More information would be helpful_This product is meant for sensitive skin, also for 'volatile' skin.  I take 'volatile' to mean skin that overreacts to being touched too much, too much sun or too much wind and dry weather.  But I wish there was more information about how this product works, when you should use it, what other products in the line need to be used with it for optimal performance. I'd give this product a 3.5 rating if I could, but I'll round it up to four stars, assuming that I probably would have received more information if I'd been introduced to it during a spa treatment.My skin overreacts by getting red and blotchy and forming 'white heads'.  I've been putting on this product in the mornings, and following the directions to apply it under my moisturizer.  My skin feels soft after application and the soft feeling continues until I wash my face again.  It hasn't taken away any redness, but my combination (oily in some places, dry in others) skin seems to have balanced out.  And I like that.  I will continue to use this product.  It should last for quite a while, as you only need a very small amount (and the pump controls the amount nicely).I've been on vacation from work, so I've been using this product underneath my Olay Regenerist moisturizer, but without makeup.  So the softness and better balance of my skin is more obvious than if my makeup was covering it.  (I use Bare Minerals powders.)I use other products in the Olay Regenerist line, and my main concern with this new product is not being able to find any information about conflicts with other products.  For instance:  When I use my Regenerist face wash, am I negating some of the benefits of this Senskin Facial Fluid?  Also, no where can I find any time frame for how long it should take to see results for redness to disappear.  The other claims Ainhoa makes about this product--calming, restorative, revitalizing, and hydrating--are all pretty much immediate results and are very subjective:  Analyzing my own feelings:  My face feels better and I feel better when I put this stuff on.  But I also feel good when I put on my Olay Regenerist Regenerating Serum.  I think this product does a better job of balancing out my oily and dry areas (than the Olay Serum)."
5755,1,Great brush set for a great price_These brushes blends foundation and concealers quit well. I love the buffing brush how it just buffs the foundation into the skin giving it that flawless coverages. These are great brushes for beginners to advanced makeup artist and would recommend this to any female who loves doing makeup!
4389,1,Love this oil!!!!!_I have been using this oil for two years now . I love how its makes my hair feel after I wash my hair . this is a staple product I only use castor oil since Im a kinky curly natural girl!!!!!!!
1637,1,"My favorite mascara by far_When I was still studying in uni, this was my favorite mascara and it's been discontinued here where I am for several years now (because they were introducing new formulas) but I know these are readily available in the US.  I love that the formula applies well, without clumping and added the right amount of volume to my lashes.  I have rather sparse and fine lashes so this worked well to thicken it up.  It holds curls well as well and I love that it didn't leave my lashes stiff and crusty like some mascaras do.  This is more of a wet formula so if you prefer drier textures, this is definitely not the mascara for you.  In humid weather, you might get a little bit of transfer on your skin throughout the day."
2204,1,"The BEST topcoat!!!_I have tried A LOT of topcoats and have been sorely disappointed...  I read the reviews for this and decided to give it a shot.  Wow!!!  I won't use anything else!  This is the BEST topcoat!  Very shiny, very durable, dries FAST, too!  After I ordered the first bottle and tried it, I went back online and ordered three MORE bottles!!!"
5919,1,"Big Curls for Straight Hair_I got this curling iron for my wife as she was complaining about the one cheap one she bought for $5.  I figured John Frieda is a respectable name and since she uses his shampoo and conditioner (Root Awakening) already, this had to be good.  I was surprised to see how hi-tech a curling iron could be.  She could set the temperature using the LCD temperature controls and it had an auto shutoff switch.  It was also convenient to use as it had a swivel cord so it never gets tangled like her old one and it only took 30 seconds to heat up.  It comes with a heat mat as well so it won't ruin the counters or anything nearby.  My wife has board straight hair and after using this she had soft, bouncy curls.  Her hair looked like it was professionally done.  She did note that on the lower temperature preset it gave only a curl at the end of the hair.  She had to increase the temperature to 400 to get the desired curl, but this may be because her hair is naturally straight.  She loves the product and so far she has not complained about her hair feeling processed either.  This curling iron is a great price for all the included features."
3121,0,"Good quality, but didn't like the scent_You know how you can tell a scent is a quality scent ...it smells natural not fake? Well this is that, but I just didn't happen to like the scent. It has a very sharp, strong flowery, honey scent. It might be perfect for someone, but not me."
9868,1,"I have never noticed such dramatic results before! amazing product_I am truly amazed at how much I am in love with this product! My face feels and looks really great. It softens and moisturizes my face like no other product I have ever used, a difference you will notice just after the first use. I don't know how but I am thinking that since it plumped up and moisturized my face that this is what lessened the look of my fine line and wrinkles.I have never noticed such dramatic results before!"
9404,1,"Peptide Powerhouse_I&#8217;ve paid a lot of money for skincare products over the years from big brand names to lesser known that brought little to no discernible results. This is a very &#8220;honest&#8221; product line (meaning has ingredients that are proven beneficial in wrinkle reduction) for a great price considering all that&#8217;s in it. The serum is light, absorbs quickly and in 3 weeks, I&#8217;ve seen a noticeable improvement both in sagging and wrinkles.  Now I see a cumulative result and anticipate even more improvement in another few weeks. I purchased both the serum and moisturizer. Excellent products and highly recommend both."
6346,1,"Hair Crack_I am a hairdresser from Southern California. I have seen a lot of advertisement for the Wen product. My hair is beached, damaged on the ends. I am seeing some thinning due to this. I have seen some success from the ovation product I seriously won't have to use that anymore. No joke, It is true what the ad says about feeling a difference the first time you use Wen. I for real threw out all of my shampoos and conditioners after using it three times. After getting out of the shower my hair dries in like five minutes now with leave in conditioner, this is crazy."
8255,1,Aewsome!!!_Everything in the package was as it is shown on the picture. It arrive in a timely manner and it was carefully packed. I can't wait to get more of this sets. Love it!!!
7955,1,"My husband's favorite_My husband has tried many body washes marketed towards men and this is by far his favorite so far. I think the strong citrus smell is what really got him (I love the smell too). He has tried other Dove body washes as well. It doesn't leave his skin feeling dry as some other body washes do (he has oily skin). He likes a good lather and this one lathers up well, better than the Suave brand he was using. This is one we will buy again!"
8206,1,"Awesome_Someone wrote a review saying these were tiny. NOT true, they're big. I have brown hair looks amazing. Love it! It's creamy and it goes on very very easily, it just brushes right on. It really couldn't be any easier. You have to hairspray over it to get it to stay for a few days."
8148,1,Very versatile great true black liner_A great true black liner !it can be applied to be a very sharp cat eye or smudged out with a brush or Q tip for a dramatic smokey eye. works great as a base for darker more dramatic looks. when i run out i'll be back to buy more. I can't live without a good liner and i think i found a new favorite!Very versatile and it staying a true black is great.When products have multiple shades of black i get so mad.
2391,1,"I love it!_So I used about two times because the peeling is pretty bad. but otherwise it took off a good chunk of scars on my face, man but when you do the baking soda rinse it burns!!! and your face is red for awhile. I like it though because it is a chemical so what do you expect? but make sure you got about a week to do it. The peeling lasted me 4 days"
6382,1,I love Sigma Brushes!_Sigma brushes are never a disappointment. I think they are waaaaaaay better than M.A.C. brushes and are about the same price. They make a good product. No compalnts.
8695,1,"Road trip tested_We used these on a recent trip, and found that they did their job well - keeping us feeling and looking fresh despite being cooped up in a vehicle over a 9 hour drive."
8294,1,"Honestly - shampoo is shampoo to me_I have waist length straight hair that while fine is very thick.  I like this shampoo a lot.  The lather feels very luxurious because the bubbles are tinier than most other shampoo's bubbles.  I believe my hair may be somewhat softer after using this product.  Like all shampoos it cleans well and rinses out easily.  I guess my hair and I have not yet succumbed to the expensive name brand hype.The only thing that might be off putting to some is the scent.  Everything I've encountered that contains aragon oil has that same distinct argan oil scent.  A bit earthy and musky, possibly too much so for some yet appealing to others.  It's not overpowering, just a subtle scent.  Once my hair is dry the scent is much more appealing than it is when smelling it straight from the bottle or while actually washing with it."
2858,0,Not worth it_You need tons of remover to fill them and they sometimes leak making them a stinky mess that can ruin whatever is around you.
6119,1,"Adorable and dainty_These are the perfect size to use as accents on &#34;dot&#34; flowers.  The array of colors makes it so that you can find a stone to match or complement any design.  Keep in mind, it doesn't come with any &#34;silver&#34; rhinestones.  I had to purchase a separate set.  But if you're looking for colors - light or bold - this is a good set to have"
5120,1,"Great Product_I've always loved Sally Hansen Hard as Nails, and this bottle is working just as well as it always did.I don't have a problem with chipping, or peeling, and it works as both a bottom coat for strength, and a top coat for abeautiful shiny finish that lasts.The seller, however, didn't ship this to me in a box, or cardboard card. They simply wrapped the bottle in bubble wrap,stuck it into an envelope and shipped it U.S. mail.  We're both pretty lucky that the bottle didn't break in shipment."
2377,1,"An acne/blackhead product that really works_Clean & Clear Blackhead Eraser Kit promises you will see a difference after just one use.  For once advertising does not lie.  My sixteen-year-old daughter is wild about this product.  In the past she has tried Neutrogena Wave and found it very harsh on the skin.  She said her skin was irritated and that resulted in even more break-outs.By contrast, the Clean & Clear kit left her skin soft and her blackheads less apparent after just one use.The kit is easy to use.  Just put in the battery (supplied in the package) and attach the medicated pad, the colored-side up.  Then run the pad under warm water, twist the bottom and massage the resulting foam on your face.  You do not even need to wet your face first.My daughter is a soccer player, and she runs everyday.  Lately she has been troubled with a cluster of blackheads on her chin.  She showed me her chin both before and after she used this product.  I could see a marked difference.  My daughter is ecstatic.I highly recommend this product.  It does exactly what it says it will do."
7945,1,"The Collection_When your grandmother and the old ladies in church warned you to stay away from [devil] red polish and lipstick... they weren't talking about your traditional bright reds or fire engine red. No, no, they were talking about Snap Happy. This polish is in that family of orangey-reds or reddish-oranges that we've seen so much of on TV for the past year or so. I've loved the color on other people, but didn't think it would work well on me. When I saw this in the store, I grabbed it for my mom. Orange nail polish is her thing. It looks super pretty on her dark brown skin, and I wasn't sure what it would look like on my medium brown skin. I have tried some of her reddish-orange polishes before and never liked them on myself. Now I have to buy my *own* bottle of Snap Happy (which is currently on my fingers and toes).It's a naughty vixen color, for sure. I've worn bright polishes before, but this is an entirely different can of worms for me. Definitely a keeper. Be warned that if you wear this polish you may feel compelled to wear lace knickers. =-pLeading Lady is very much like a couple of other polishes I have. It covers best at 3 coats (depending on how thin you coat your nails) and absolutely requires a good, thick topcoat to provide the high shine. I do have to say that I actually like this red glitter polish better than the ones I've had in the past. Just don't omit the topcoat.Butler Please is super close in color to Mezmerised [sic]. It's a nice shade of blue, but not as different as I was hoping. Of the three that I purchased from the Winter 2012 collection so far Snap Happy is my favorite.Update 8.9.13 - I just got a bottle of Beyond Cozy from a grocery store mark down bin last week. It's super opaque and won't disappoint. Full coverage in just one coat, but you may prefer two. Glitter polishes tend to be highly textured, and this one is no exception. As such you may prefer to use two coats of top coat to get a smoother finish. However, OPI's Spark de Triomphe actually lasts longer.Where's My Chauffeur is pretty close in color to Essie's In the Cab-ana, but not as bright. This color is a bit lighter and far less dramatic. A bright fun color, but like In the Cab-ana's good twin."
2446,1,"Ouch_I hate shaving the bikini area and have been professionally waxed numerous times.  I tried Surgi Wax and it was fairly easy to use (a little mess...but it is wax) and yes, it does hurt but not as much as I though it would.  The 2nd time I waxed I got wax stuck to my skin (even though I used the oil) and it didn't come off for about 2 days.  Fortunately it did not irritate my skin at all.  Considering the price per waxing at home compared to having it done at a spa, I think it's worth the self-inflicted pain for so much cheaper vs the professional inflicted pain for considerably more money. I will continue to use the product and grimace once a month while I pull my hair out by the roots.  Then I will smile at the nice smooth results."
1298,1,I love it_good product
7740,0,"Don't waste your money_No noticeable difference from using my regular INEXPENSIVE conditioner for my co-washes.  I just don't see the point of buying expensive conditioner like this for co-washing, when you can get the same or BETTER effects from using your favorite, INexpensive, sulfate free conditioner.Naturals INVENTED the term co-wash, it simply means &#34;wash hair with conditioner&#34;.  You don't need a fancy label OR a fancy price to get the same effect.  The As I Am line is just an attempt to capitalize on the natural hair movement.  Don't be a sucker.  Stick to natural homemade products that you can find on sites like curlynikki.com and watch bloggers like Hairscapades."
7370,1,Great for foundation and cheek color_Love this brush to use for liquid foundation and also for cheek color.  I use it frequently to put contour powder in the hollows of my cheeks because it fits the shape of my face perfectly.  It would also work well for applying blusher or highlighter.  I love the Real Techniques brushes because you aren't stuck to using it for one thing.  They are very versatile brushes that are well made and easy to clean.
6888,1,"Works for me_This product works for me.  I previously tried a balancing lotion from Nivea and oil control washes from other brands, but they did not seem to work.  I've been using Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash for a week and I notices less oil on my face and fewer breakouts.I am a bit concerned that ingredients sound like they belong in a chemical lab, but the bottle says it is gentle enough for daily use.  I trust the Cetaphil brand, so I assume it is OK to use this wash, plus it works for me."
6041,1,"I'll admit it_I love this face wash.  Use it everyday and I swear by it.  This is the only face wash I have found that really scrubs my face and makes my face feel clean and smooth after.........  I feel awkward talking about face wash this must but this stuff works!!  Buy it, use it, you'll love it!"
280,1,Better than Sally Hansen Hard As Nails_I wondered if the added expense was worth it and it is. Makes a strong long lasting nail protection for my weak nails that shred at every opportunity.
335,1,"Beautiful Brush_If you do ANYTHING in your crease, you need this brush. It blends beautifully, and gives a completely natural, blended finish. It's also good for buffing out anything. It's soft, yet stiff enough to get the job done.I'm a total fan!"
9509,1,"nice shampoo_My son really likes this shampoo. Lathers well, does a great job cleaning the hair, reducing dandruff and rinses clean.  nice smell as well."
4213,1,Like Butter_I bought this product along with the silicone mix. I like using this product alone rather than with the silicon mix. This stuff makes my hair feel like butter. The smell is light and not overbearing. I would recommend this to others!
6879,1,"Much nicer than my last attempt at nail brushes_I was not going to spend a lot of money on nail paint brushes.  I bought some cheap ones on Amazon before that were OK, but lost bristles after a few uses.  These are nice.  They actually remind me more of artist's brushes.  I love the variety too, and they are the same price as you'd normally get only a few brushes!  I even took one of the fan brushes to apply a face acid peel to my skin.  It works well."
3058,0,"Good Quality Cream - Overpowering Fragrance_The cream itself is very rich and wonderful feeling. Unfortunately, the fragrance is beyond overpowering. I'm not talking about a 'little goes a long way' amount, either. I'm talking about a fragrance so strong it completely assaults and overwhelms your senses (and everyone else's in the room, theater, etc). I got a headache from it within a couple minutes and ended up feeling the need to wash it off because it was so strong. Wayyy too potent a fragrance, even for a highly perfumed cream, in my opinion."

3913,1,"What luck._I have been using MAC concealer for years and didn't think it could get any better. On some random whim, I decided to try this one and I love it more than myMAC Studio Sculpt Concealer NC15. It's emollient and creamy so it never gets flaky. Even though it is emollient and creamy it doesn't budge. Stays put. It creases a little but if you blend it well and set with powder it isn't as bad. It also lasts through the two hours of power yoga I do on a daily basis so I'd say it's about perfect. My MAC concealer did not hold up.As far as the shade goes, it's perfect for me. I'm a pale NC15 in MAC and the Light shade of this one is well matched, even better actually because it doesn't have some of the orange tint the MAC one does.It's excellent. Definitely recommended."
7458,1,"Shiny, smooth and pretty!_I don't know what else you could ask for in a conditioner; it conditions my hair and leaves it shiny smooth and pretty. I have no complaints about this fine product!"
753,1,"I use no other soap_I use no other soap. It foams and soothes the skin, and cleans as well as any harsher soap. I love the way it smells and the way it leaves my skin."
7500,1,My Crimson Amulet pallet inspired by the movie Dark Shadows_I just got my Crimson Amulet pallet from Nyx inspired by the Movie Dark Shadows. I would say this pallet is about Medium Sized. Does not Give you a tutorial to the 3 vampire ladies looks only gives you a brief little Story about there Characters. not really any eyeliner the nyx Eye shadow Base seems about the same size you would recive if you were to order a regular size. there are Lots of eye shadows to Chose from the Blushes are all very Beautiful and Well pigmented for your Skin. I love the Fact that you Get a mirror with it.
2246,1,"Amazing results over night!_I am almost 28 years old and decided it was time to really start taking care of my skin. My boyfriend just turned 40 and looks amazing... and here I am at 28 with fine lines around my eyes and laugh lines when I smile big! But other than that my skin looks pretty good. I don't get out too much in the sun... not because I don't want to but because working full time in front of a desk and being a mom doesn't allow for much sun bathing! So my skin had fairly even tone and no spots but I was amazed that this product made such a dramatic difference.This product is amzaing... I used just 3-4 drops the first night. It felt great. It instantly made me skin feel smoother and looked much brighter. I went to bed and woke up with the softest skin. That morning I used it again right after the shower. It instantly tightens, smoothes the skin, and brightens.I tend to have oily skin and breakouts and this seems to heal blemishes faster and didn't cause any breakouts.I knows its $30 a bottle but you use so little and its a fraction what the other brands cost for the same product.I am sold. I LOVE this stuff.*****NOTE***** Today is May 24 which means I have been using this product for roughly a month now. I use it every morning right after I get out of the shower. My skin looks so much brighter and smoother having added this to my skin care regimen. On the weekends, I find myself using this, my moisturizer/spf and a little of my smashbox primer instead of makeup and feel completely confident in my appearance. Its amazing how much my skin has improved without realizing it had that much room to improve! I also have noticed undery my eyes and my crows feet are much more smooth. The only downside is with my skin being overall more healthy, it does leave a bit of a shine to my face after I apply it."
364,1,"AMAZING &#60;3_This cleanser by philosophy is THE BOMB DOT COM! I love using it when removing my makeup at the end of the day! It removes all my makeup but I always make sure that I use makeup removing facial wipes, for instance; the Neutrogena Makeup Removing Cleansing Towlettes to remove any left over foundation/makeup from my face. But anyways it leaves my face feeling soft, clean and fresh after!"
1301,1,"Guilty Pleasure_MIDNIGHT FANTASY is strong on the fruit notes. The notes of plum & cherries stayed with me all the way through the floral hearts notes. The result was that I couldn't separate any of the floral notes.The vanilla in the base was also very subtle; I could pick out the musky tones. I'd have thought the base would be sweet, but it's not. MIDNIGHT FANTASY is all about the fruity notes. It failed to remind me of the original FANTASY; I don't know why it wasn't marketed as a new fragrance, instead of Fantasy: 2.Personally I love plums & cherries so I do adore MIDNIGHT FANTASY, though I have to remove a star as it can be sickly in warm weather. I'd stick to autumn/winter for this.Scent notes: Black cherries, framboise, plum, orchid, freesia, iris, musk, amber and vanilla."
7701,1,I really love this product_It came earlier than expected it was all here and none of it was damaged and it was exactly what I ordered! I'M really happy I purchased this product!!!
5121,1,This is my top coat.  I highly recommend it._This is my mainstay top coat.  It dries pretty fast and it doesn't dry up fast in the bottle.  You get a ton of uses out of one bottle.
7710,1,"YES_i have tried so many bronzers and highlighters,this makes it SOOO EASY. It is pretty dark, i'm mexican and it works pretty well for me, you need to blend, extremely pigmented. the quality of sleek is AMAZING. the highlighter isn't over sparkly, it compliments perfectly. its so easy and compact. great product."
640,1,best_i really like these pore strips but the online price is a lil steep but well worth it. only works best when you keep up a good skincare routine
5096,1,"WOOOOO_Best product I have in my makeup collection. I always put my foundation on with this now, no other way. I tell every one about it and how much it's worth the price."
2846,1,"Love this_Thow this does not really firm up your skin which I really didn't expect it to do, it does make your skin feel so soft that you can't stop touching it. Like your running your hand over velvet."
212,1,"Surprising_I started a new skin regimen recently, retinol cream, AHA 8% cream and this Olay Regenerist Daily Serum, and I'm amazed that I can see a difference already, in a week. My skin is smoother and healthier looking and even a little tighter, altho there is not yet a huge difference in that department. Still, I recommend this as part of your skin care regimen because it seems to give the others a boost. I useOlay Complete All Day UV Moisturizer, SPF 15, Sensitive Skin, 6 Ounce (Pack of 2)every day, as well."
3420,1,"Very good quality, great for all skin types_I always use natural soaps that are synthetic fragrance & chemical free. This stuff is great and rivals a top quality goats milk soap I normally use.I have oily, acne prone skin with dry patches and dead skin buildup. This soap and a buff puff get rid of all traces of makeup, reduces dead skin buildup, and reduces oil production because it doesn't strip the skin. I also no longer have any dry patches.Great stuff and well worth the reasonable price."
8119,1,"Cristophe Hair Serum_I have tried a few hair serums, and while most well very well on my hair, I like this one a bit more.  It seems that I can use a VERY small amount, really just a drop to get my hair to behave and it feels  so soft that I find myself running my hands through it often.  If it's humid and I see my hair start to go wild,  I simply use another drop, rub it between my hands, and lightly run them down the frizzy areas to tame them without making them sticky."
7081,0,"Doesnt do diddly squat_this was a rip off, it helped huge pimples but not blackheads at all, all i was doing was stabbing at myself!"
2390,1,"great_This stuff works great, highly recommend, it will burn like fire but stand in front of a fan and the burning is a little easier to take. You will not see any frosting as it says on the bottle so don't wait for it, but you will peel within the week and you will be beet red afterwards, so get ready. splash some cold water on your face and cool down with a cold cloth and you will be good to go, put on some moisturizer afterwards and stay out of the sun."
5025,1,"So it's not Clairsonic, It is a great item for the price_I have been using this for a few months now, and have seen a dramatic improvement in the appearance of my skin. It makes blemishes heal and disappear quickly, and does prevent new ones from coming. I was hesitant to use the exfoliating cleaner every day, but the 'abrasive' element is about the consistency of baking soda, so it's extremely mild, but effective.I know that the Clarisonic is the Holy Grail of all scubby brush systems, and I may consider purchasing it after using this, but this works extremely well for my face and decolletage. I use it with Neutrogena face wash every day and the exfoliating cleanser every few days. I've not yet had to change the brush out, but I bought the refills with the unit just because it seems they sell out quite quickly."
3378,1,"Great for babies with sensitive skin_My son had moderate eczema as an infant, and we started using this instead of the Johnson and Johnson varieties of bath wash we had. This does not irritate his skin at all, and gets it clean without over drying it. Our son also has a ton of hair and we use it for his hair too. It works great. We have been using this for his bath followed by Cedaphil after for the last 10 mo., and it's been great. Highly recommend it."
5423,1,"Does the job, minimal shedding_Feels secure in the hand and sturdy. Bought it to replace a similar item that had worn out. The only huge difference was the size of the loop of rope/string on the end, the original was large enough to hang from the faucet, this is much smaller in diameter."
8464,1,"Great 2 in 1 For Hair!_I wanted my husband to have a shampoo that didn't smell like an old man, I came across this great Aze product that really stood out.  With this 2 in 1, he gets that conditioner he needs too and it only takes him 1 chance to wash his hair, so it saves him time."
21,1,"Great for Night_I used this when I was a teenager to keep my skin clear. I never really had very bad acne, just a few bumps here and there. This really helped keep it under control. Luckily when I reached my early twenties my breakouts became only bothersome once monthly.I used this with the Morning Burst products and the Blackhead Clearing products from Clean & Clear. I mostly used this at night and used the Morning Burst with spf moisturizer in the daytime.When using this, my skin was squeaky clean and I was constantly getting compliments. Now that I'm older, this is too harsh for me. I switched to Olay once acne was no longer a daily concern."
610,1,"Wow... surprising_I have shoulder length, curly, frizzy hair. I tried this on a whim - switching off biosilk and chi. Not bad. I used it on damp hair and blew it out. Felt amazing, salon feel and everything. I didnt even need to hot iron it! So I did what any happy woman would do - follow the directions and add one more drop to dry hair for finishing. Strike. It weighed down my hair and it felt kinda yucky. SOOoooo I turned it into an opportunity to hot iron :) Lets stay positive, right? It made it nicer, so heat is a def with this product. I personally think its over kill to use on dry hair without adding heat. I'd even say that using it for the flat iron isnt AHHHMAZING as it should be for nearly $20 a bottle. Outcome? I'll try it again for a few days since it cuts down drying time and hair feels great, but I dont see this being my one and all."
4621,0,"Am I Missing Something?_I tried the Envyderm Cosmetics Eyelash Enhancement and Conditioning Nighttime Serum, and the only claim it lives up to, for me, is that the tube does last about 5 months. It probably conditioned my lashes, too, but I didn't notice any results such as darker lashes, thicker lashes, longer lashes, or any other result that would make me look in the mirror at my eyelashes and say 'WOW!!!  Thank you, Envyderm!'  I have to laugh at the product description's assertion that this product is a great alternative to false eyelashes, because to me, that's like saying that's like saying a graham cracker is a great alternative to a TV remote.  Doesn't even come close to accomplishing the same thing.  I'm really glad that there are people who've had amazing results from this product.  I followed the directions and didn't see any results, so from where I stand, this product is overpriced snake oil."
1530,1,"I like the smell...a lot!_I try to buy natural or organic products, especially when it is something that I am going to rub on my skin. The Naked Bee hand and body lotion (orange blossom honey aroma) is one that I have chosen to use to moisturize.I like the fact that I don't have to worry about rubbing too many toxins into my skin. My favorite part is the smell though -- it smells as advertised -- orange blossom honey. Since I love citrus aromas, the smell of this lotion satisfies all my senses."
7976,1,Great Set of Polishes!_Great Set of Polishes! I Love the variety of colors. This is my first time trying this stuff! Saw another brand in the store and it is much more expensive in that brand than with the Shany brand. Very much more economical!
7434,1,"Seems to work well on waist long hair - but smell is too strong_I have waist long hair and work-out on a regular basis. During summer, that translates into a major beating in the hot/humid Florida sun, rain and did I mention the super high humidity?! Needless to say, my hair tends to frazzle fairly quickly with the daily washing, swimming, beating sun...and of course, let's not forget the humidity.So, I try a LOT of different hair products. Some are oily (ugh), others seem to actually dry out my hair, still others seem to attract tangles...and with 3 feet of hair to untangle, that is no small considerations.I gave this a try and it does seem to work fairly well. I also used it in combination with a deep oil treatment to get started (see other review) because my hair was in pretty rough shape right now. You can notice the difference after a week so it does what is claims. However - and this is a big one for me - the fragrance is VERY strong. I find it overpowering. My spouse LOVES IT. In fact, he is was using another bottle and is ready to take over all of them because of the smell alone. Me on the other hand, I find it much too strong. Of course, that is personal preference but if you are sensitive to fragrances, keep this in mind before purchasing the product.Last but not least, despite the additional of vitamins/supplements to enhance the product, I've been moving aware of many of the other harsh ingredients/chemicals contained in this/other shampoo's and conditioners. I did NOT deduct a point for it because once again, that is a lifestyle related choice.Bottom Line - a good product for long hair but those with sensitivities to fragrance will want to think twice."
4276,1,"Good Product_I bought this product to use with Qhemetic Biologics Amla & Olive Heavy Cream. I have dry and thick 4B/4C hair, so moisturizing is very important to me. So far the Shea Moisture Products have worked for me making my hair more manageable and soft; this product so far being one of my favorites. As mentioned in earlier reviews, the smell can be strong, I have learned that a little goes a long way. For me, I use this smoothie cream for two strand twists wet/damp. I let it dry overnight and usually wake up with soft, moisturized twists. I would definitely recommend as a moisturizing product."
3051,1,"Solid hair dryer_I was very pleasantly surprised by this hairdryer, it had more features and a better button layout than I had expected.  It is a very good buy for the &lt;$50 range.Pros:* Selected airflow stays constant even when changing heat settings. (Other inferior brands decrease air flow when heat is lowered)* Easily adjustable yet secure buttons. (other brands are either awkward to move or move by themselves during the drying process)* Barrel doesn't overheat so you won't accidentally burn yourself on it.* 2 separate switches for the settings encourage longevity of dryer motor: 1 for heat, and the other for airflow.* Attachments (diffuser and concentrator nozzle) snap on instead of sliding on.* Does not sound like a lawnmower (although not exactly quiet): but reasonable for an 1875 Watt midsize hairdryer.* Comes with a diffuser.* Removable intake filter and cap/cage.  Especially important if you have pets in the home as their floaties invariably gets stuck on the filter.* 1875 Watts power does feel like 1875 Watts power.Cons:* Despite multiple settings, not enough velocity for its size. Needs one more 'high' velocity setting.* Cord shorter than average for a dryer of this size* Not as quiet as advertised.* Not lighweight, but more midweight.  However, balance in the hand and arm is good.It compares itself to the CHI dryers which I have not tried and therefore cannot comment, but I would buy this dryer over any Braun (Europe), Revlon, Vidal Sassoon, Oster, Andis or Conair in this price category. The Babyliss are a bit quieter and flashier looking, but cost a bit more.  The T3 series, for what it does, seems way overpriced when compared to this Remington.  Overall a good hairdryer at this price and a solid buy. (There is a 4-year warranty too)"
9565,1,"Smells Great_I have heard some good things and bad things about Axe products before. This is the first one I've gotten for my husband to try. I can't speak for all the other Axe scents, but I absolutely love this one. It has a very clean scent of a pine forest. It's not too strong, but it does linger for a while. My husband says it suds up fine and he likes using it. We both would recommend this product if you like woodsy, balsam, pine scents."
8130,1,"Great Product!_I also wrote a review about Olay with foundation, indicating that I much prefer this product.  It seems to have the same moisturizing ability as the Olay with foundation, but feels lighter on the skin, as well as more absorbable.  I'll stick with this, as I have for years."
4177,1,"Huge palette, very afforadable!_I love this palette for a few different reasons. One, it's so affordable, and secondly it's got just about any color you can think of and then some. This is great for any artist that travels, or beginners. Great quality!"
9798,1,"Love this stuff_I love Vitamin C Serum and this is one of the best formulas I've tried. It has a nice consistency that spreads evenly over my face. Leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated and helps my moisturizer absorb better, which I apply after the serum. Has eliminated dullness and flakiness, and added more natural glow."
9299,1,"Use as directed!_I was offered a free sample of VIDI Vitamin C20 serum in exchange for an honest review. Used as directed, this is a great product. I haven&#8217;t seen my skin go through any major changes (I&#8217;m 63), but it looks good and seems somewhat smoother. I found that my skin felt a bit tighter after a few days, but putting on an Aloe Vera Moisturizer over the serum during the day seemed to take care of that. I applied the serum in the morning and before I went to bed and used it without anything else at night. I love the delicate citrus smell, which goes away as the serum penetrates the skin. The package warns that the serum can increase sensitivity to the sun and suggests wearing sunscreen while using the product outdoors. Heed this warning! I forgot to apply the moisturizer one morning and went for a walk. I haven&#8217;t sunburned in a long time, but for some reason my chin burned to the point of blistering. I was shocked! With moisturizer or sunscreen, there should be no problem, so don&#8217;t forget like I did! I do not fault the product in any way since this was an &#8220;operator error&#8221; - I just want to warn possible users to take the warning seriously."
7679,1,"Evens out skin tone and gives a slight luminous glow_The towelettes are wonderful, there is a very light fragrance, the texture of the cloth is soft and non-abrasive.  I like using it in the morning since my skin gets a slight luminous glow even without using a luminizer.  The cloth cleaned well and left a nice hydrated feel on your skin.  I also noticed that it evens out skin tone.  I had some dark patches this winter and my skin was looking dull, using this helped lighten the small dark patches from a pimples drying out."
7087,1,"Level 1 works best_I would say if you are going to do peels at home use these level one peels.Anything more powerful and you should really be seeing a professional.  No one wants to make a mess of their face.The peel does just what it says.  You will see results right away.  Your pores will be smaller, your blackheads disappear or are easier to get to and your skin will &#34;glow&#34;.Use an astringent before you apply, wear gloves (especially if you have shellac), have a fan handy because it does sting a little, start out with the recommended time and work your way up (i'm at 6 min twice a week), rinse very, very well, don't rub off the water harshly with a towel, moisturize after and USE SUNCREEN!!!!"
1017,1,"wish it was faster_it is ok, only wish it did my hair faster, it takes a a lot of time, i guess it is not hot enough or something, i suggest if you are going out, at least put a side two hours or an hour and half to get those perfect waves."
4972,1,"Surprising_Any product that includes shea butter or any other butter is suspect in my mind as it usually means a product that weighs down my hair.  This hair smoother does include shea butter along with honey and soymilk.  It left my hair very soft but manageable and did give some slight definition to the curl.  The latter mostly because of the lack of frizz I suspect.  I first used it on my naturally curly hair on a humid day and it really did help with the frizz issue.  The product is used after washing and conditioning the hair and is left in the hair rather than rinsed out.  I did not use a large amount which I suspect helped avoid the heaviness.  If your hair is curly, or you use a curler, and you are interested in a product that helps cut down on the frizz while leaving your hair soft and manageable, I suggest giving this a try."
2237,1,"Love this concealer_I really love this concealer it hides everything that I need it too, and its not a really heavy feeling concealer which I love!! :D"
4559,1,"Great product! A little goes a long way!_This stuff is amazing for my dry, damaged hair. After it was bleached, then dyed several darker colors afterwards, it was awful. My poor hair was dead. I've been using this for about a month, and there is a HUGE difference in my hair. It looks and feels healthy! It's so soft and shiny, and smells good after using this product! I would recommend this for anyone, and all hair types!"
515,1,"A Powder to Lessen Eye Lines and Dark Shadows? Yes. Really._Laura Mercier's heavenly and lightweight Secret Brightening Powder makes your under eye area look bright and naturally radiant. If you suffer from chronic dark under eye circles like I do you'll love how this powder weightlessly increases the coverage of under eye cover products while adding soft focus lightening and brightening. It helps concealer to dramatically reduce the appearance of dark under eye circles as it sets concealer to keep it in place all day!Unlike other powders which can accentuate the look of dryness and lines in the eye area, Laura Mercier's specially formulated under eye powder gives a soft focus to fine lines and minimizes imperfections. The powder is ground to the micronised level so it won't settle in the fine lines to emphasize like other powders can so easily do.Usage Instructions:Keep in mind a little of this product goes a very long way. Pat powder lightly on the area of application without dragging or tugging across skin. Laura recommends using her Camouflage Powder Brush which I agree makes any powder applied in the eye area look softer and less heavy while guarenteeing a soft and even application. It helps you get just the right amount applied. Secret Brightening Powder is great under the eye where allergies, stress, and lack of sleep show up quickly. Ideally this is used to set Laura's Secret Brightener (a lightening brush wand highlighter), Secret Concealer (Laura's fantastic under eye concealer), and/or Secret Camouflage (Laura's famous and award winning camouflage coverup.)Remember, if you get enough of anything packed on in one spot it will show up so only use a little bit. I recommend tapping the above mentioned brush into the fine film of powder on the inside of the lid. [With the lid in place, tip the jar upside down and then right side up again. When you remove the lid you'll notice a fine film of powder there.] Rarely do I need more than this. Even though the container is smaller than the average face powder, it has lasted me a very long time even with constant use. I also use it to set creme shadows and eye shadow bases with the end result being a very `clean' eye look that resists creases. The silky texture also makes applying powder eye shadow a dream! As a makeup artist I've used this powder all around the eyes of women of a broad range of skin tones (from pale Irish to deep African American) and different ages (from teen to great grandma) all having varying degrees of lines, bags, and dark circles and still got the same fabulous results every time. Secret Brightening Powder is also appropriate for all skin types. It's rare that one product works well on everyone.Finer Points:-Micronized Pigments provide a soft weightless texture that won't settle into lines . . . really.-Silicone Polymers provide an out of this world, slippy, silky feel.-White Transparent Pigment offers an invisible lightening effect on the skin without the look of ashiness. The formulation is so sheer that it works on any and all skin tones. Instantly opens up your eyes."
458,1,"Smells delicious_Literally smells like maraschino cherries. I haven't really noticed that it's done much for my cuticles. It does make them softer and soaks in within about a half hour or so. I've been trying to track down the reason my cuticles are so chewed up without cause. This didn't solve it, but it is lovely if you need a little boost. Now on to the next solution for me..."
8006,1,"WOW Great Facial Serum_This is a wonderful facial skin serum.  No irritation, no itching, not oily - just softness.  I really enjoyed this product as I have sensitive skin and can't use many skin care items.  This was an excellent find."
5589,1,"Love the product, will buy in full size_This set is great for testing these out, but be warned they are TINY! If you like the product you will obviously have to buy the full size pretty soon because these things are minuscule! High beam is my favorite, used benetint on my lips and liked that too (except it has a strange taste/smell)."
7674,1,"Amazing_I color my hair and with styling my hair everyday, my hair goes through it. This product keeps my hair soft, shiny, and manageable.Love this product."
5695,1,Like silk...._...this product goes on like silk and stays on...it will not rub off and discolor dark garments...it will keep you smooth...
2183,1,Lots of volume that's natural looking. I love it!_This mascara separates lashes nicely and looks very natural. Eyelashes are soft and light-weight. The brush is great and allows easy application in the corners of eyes. No smudging or racoon eyes too so it's a perfect mascara!
7079,1,"Used at least once a week._I get these little white hard specks in my chin and around my mouth.I use the point to dig into them,and then you place the circle around the area and press and drag and usually,with one try,I can get them out."
6708,1,Nail Salon at home!_I was on the look for a gel UV gel light so I can do my gel nails at home. So when I came across this I said why not give it a try. This is wonderful it's small so I can store it and take it anywhere. I used different brands of gel nail polishes and it does cure them. I have no problems with it. The bulbs go around so I feel it cures all of my nails. Tip: first put in your fingers than separately cure your thumb by itself
1789,1,"A Must Have!!!!!!_Love, Love, Love this product strengthens your hair, stops it from falling out and promotes new growth.You will see a difference from the first wash. Your hair feels cleaner, stronger, and softer. Your scalp will thank you when you done."
2080,1,"Great for travel!_After reading the reviews here I decided to purchase the dryer for some upcoming travel plans and I'm glad I did.  It is lightweight and packs away easily in a suitcase.  I used it in the US with no problem but do make sure you read the directions carefully and put all attatchments on correctly with no blockages.  The thing is very sensitive and overheats easily.  It will shut itself off immediately when it gets too hot so there's no fear of overheating and such as a previous reviewer suggested.  I will say though that you should wear something around your neck as the plastic headpiece does tend to get very hot on contact with the back of my neck.  Otherwise it was quick, easy and my hair came out perfectly each time.I took the dryer overseas with me and it worked like a charm when plugged into an extension chord that was plugged into the proper adapters, though you can only use the dryer on the 'cool' setting overseas.  The voltage of international outlets makes the dryer heat up much higher than in the states and the dryer will overheat and shut itself off if you put it on any other setting but cool.  The 'cool' setting will run plenty hot enough though.  The downside is that you will lose the ability to run a cool setting on the dryer when out of the country.  Still, I'd say this dryer is one of the most clever accessories I've found. I prefer it over my old hard hat dryer."
9042,1,"Bye bye tangles!_This brush took the screaming out of brushing my little girls hair. She says it doesn't pull and loves this brush. Comfortable handle too. My daughter has very long, thick wavy hair and this works like a charm!"
5225,1,"Such a Smooth Feeling!_I love to shower with this body wash.  It makes my skin feels so soft.  I feel clean and fresh! I am very satisfied.Guess what, I updated my comments on Oct. 9, 2013:I decided to blend this product with the 'Olay 2-In-1 Advanced Ribbons Soothing Cr&egrave;me + Advanced Moisture Body Wash 18 Oz (Pack of 3.)' The experience was both revitalizing, invigorating and rejuvenating.Also, when 'I bathe, I find that I do Not leave a dirty, bathtub ring!' I'm sold, ring it up and get it to me quickly. They work fabulously together."
269,1,Pretty_I love OPI nail polish and this color did not disappoint.  It is very rich in color and gets a lot of compliments.
745,1,"Excellent top coat_I use this as a base and top coat with OPI polish and my nail polish lasts at least 5 days...it is very shiny and people notice the finish. You might need to do a tiny touch up in the 5 day period, but generally it really keeps the polish in good shape."
5528,1,eye shadow base_This is an easy product to use and it seems to work very well in preventing your eye shadow from dreading.
1012,1,"I Can't Live Without It_This product is fabulous.  It makes even the most sensitive skin silky smooth and soft.  If my skin can tolerate it, I believe anyone can use it.  It's  a life saver."
3268,1,Like but dont love it_I wanted to use it as a eyeliner but its not as pigmented as some of the other colors I have used. It does make a great base for eye shadows though.
8839,1,Perfect_I love this case! The color matches what is shown in the picture and it has plenty of room for all of my disks. So far I have no complaints and would recommend this to others!
9609,0,"OZ Naturals Eye Cream for Dark Circles_I chose this product because I trusted Oz to formulate a cream that would take care of dark circles in particular.  So far I have to give it a thumbs down but I will proceed with it until I finish it and see if it just takes a long time to work.  As of now though, I am disappointed."
1545,1,"Wonderful_I have used this product in my youth years and stopped because it became hard to find in retail stores in NYC. I found it and have stocked up on the oatmeal and almond. I also use it on my face, which was acne toned skin and it doesnt irritate or buildup any more oil. Love the produce inexpensive and the light scent is wonderful. I wish they had body sprays for each scent! So Light and Fresh!"
5283,1,"Great cheap wig!_I trimmed the bangs but truly, this rocks for the price. It's fun and has a real Pulp Fiction look! Go Uma...."
7657,1,"Great, pefect for start-up_This is perfect for someone who is just starting to do their own nails. Good color variety, and my daughter's love adding glitter accents to their nails"
5558,0,"Will not repurchase._Never saw results with this product. The only thing that has worked for my dry, cracked lips in Ohio's winter is Vaseline!"
5566,1,"Love it_Have the set.  Original and this formula.  I like them the same and they really help my brittle nails, I've used them for quite some time now."
5833,1,"Works on some blemishes_This little device requires you to treat pimples three times a day for two minutes each for it to work. I've found it to work when I start treatment in the early stages of pimple development and on some types of pimples. For example, it doesn't seem to work on those pimples that turn fast into white heads but works on those that either take longer to come out or never really do. It's a good device to have if you suffer from blemishes if you can get it at a discount, I think the full price is very expensive especially since it's essentially a disposable item because once it's predetermined number of zaps is over you have to throw it out and get a new one."
4982,0,"My relationship with this product?  It's complicated._I'm only giving this product 2 stars.... not because it doesn't work (It does) but due to the instructions/poor value.I have elbow length natural blonde and grey hair.... very oily scalp, dry ends.First, the positive: This product absolutely worked on my hair.  The roots/scalp were effectively cleaned and the ends were well conditioned.  This product cleans thoroughly and leaves hair in fantastic condition.My complaints are 100% about the reality of using this product.  Before buying, read the instructions... this product is not used in the same method as other products.On the bottle, you are instructed to use 20-30 pumps of product.  I used half that amount and it was plenty.  However, even at 12-15 pumps per use, a 6oz bottle will only last 5-7 uses.  If you shower/shampoo daily, you will need a new bottle every week.  Can you afford to purchase this product weekly?  Can you justify that expense?Other criticisms:While I was not able to use a wide-tooth comb in the shower, my hair de-tangled easily after the shower.  I had the comb in the shower and I tried to comb product through (per the instructions) but could not.  I simply could not get the comb through my hair at all!  Ironically, the same comb flew through my hair after the shower.  Again, A+ for detangling (product works!) and &#34;F&#34; for the instructions which are not helpful and set the wrong expectation.Fragrance of this product is pleasant but somewhat medicinal.  And it lasts.  You better like it, because it is going to stick with you for at least half the day.So, that is my review.... I hate the instructions but the product works.  However, it is obscenely expensive when used as directed.I buy premium shampoos/conditioners ($20-50 for a month's worth of effective product is not unreasonable to me).  WEN's results are excellent but so are the results from other &#34;premium&#34; hair products... There simply is not enough benefit to this product to justify the expense."
2421,1,Good amount for price_Like that you get as much as you do for the price that you pay.  It lasts a long time and smells good too.
9313,1,OMG_I love this. I've wanted stiletto nails for the longest. I found them here for cheap. Only thing I recommend you to so is cut them down a bit.
5934,1,sweet cupcake_this will be my second time ordering and I really love him natural when you put them onso if you'd like to looknatural when you worry I would definitely recommend this to youlove it
7360,1,"great deal for this size package._I was ordering this in subscribe and save.Unfortunately, they no longer sell it for s&s.;I was getting a better price.This is a good soap, it does not have all those additives that dry out your skin."
7208,1,"LOVE&lt; LOVE&lt; Love this product._So happy I discovered this!!! This is by far the best bb cream out there. I have combination skin and it does make me break out and has buildable coverage if u choose to use it as a foundation coverage! Does a great job!! I own several shades depending on the season. I do not use any other foundation nor primer with this, this is truly the all in one product and it lasts!!! Beautiful results and easy to blend with a sponge, brush, or your fingers!"
8961,1,"Great sigma dupes_Amazing product just as good or better than sigma! They blend so well and hold up amazing, very little shedding"
4280,1,"Good product_I have been using shea butter for my hair and body for 3 years now and I love this shea moisture product. I have found some hair smooties that work a little better, but this a good product."
5569,1,"Pretty Pretty Pretty_I love the Hot Pop Pink color!  It is very vibrant and matches the bottle color closely, LOVE Shellac polish!"
7826,1,"Good variety_I got these a few weeks ago for doing my nails with and they are pretty cool. There is a lot of variety in the colors and shapes and sizes. It also comes with 2 dotting pens which I've been wanting. The only bad part is that shipping took a while, but it was sent from China so I can't really complain. Plus it was really cheap."
8514,1,"Caffeinated shampoo a solid choice_Yes, this stuff has caffeine in it, which apparently helps thicken men's hair. Calcium is also part of the mix, and between the two ingredients, Dove Men+Care shampoo does a good job of making your hair look rich and full after showering.What I like best about it, however, is the subtle pine, almost grassy, scent, which makes this a shampoo that outdoorsy males might gravitate toward. Quick-and-to-the-point copy on the back of the gray bottle culminates with the bold letters MAN-PROOF YOUR HAIR. The low-frills ad copy and bottle design belie the fact that a lot of care went into making this foamy and 'fortifying' shampoo. Discerning guys will appreciate that."
3294,1,smells so clean_i love the smell of lemon and the shea butter leaves your skin so soft and refreshed the bar has lasted me for about 3 weeks and still smell so good
665,1,I love this grow shampoo & conditioner_I have tried zillions of shampoos and conditioners at every salon...stores...and online..but this grow shampoo and conditioner is the ONLY one that kept my hair super clean with 100% Manageability and softness...im not out for faster hair growth...but more hair manageability and softness...love this shampoo and conditioner of grow!!!!!
7092,0,"Yuck_Yuck. It burned my face,broke me out,left me a scar,and totally ruin everything. Ugghh. Fast shipping though. I'll just stick with the 20% one."
8382,0,"Does NOT compare to beauty blender.  Don't bother_They are much stiffer than the nice makeup sponges that you get at Sephora...but for the price, I couldn't resist.  They do an alright job for small things (like concealer) but I use my nicer more expensive sponges for foundation.  The problem with this sponge is that it does not absorb or expand with water like it should.  This is an extremely stiff and poor imitation.  I suppose it is better than nothing, but not by much.If you're looking for a cheaper alternative to the beauty blender...there's one at Ulta by Real Techniques for around $6 that is pretty close to the beauty blender at a much better price.  It is nice and soft and abosrbs water before use nicely.  I use both it and the beauty blender...one for each product."
8134,1,"I Got This For My Wife, Then Stole it_Being a man, I've never put any creams, balms, unguents, liniment, or moisturizers on my face.  However, I got stuck in a blizzard a while ago and the wind chapped my face pretty good.  When I got home, I tried my wife's Olay Fresh Effects moisturizer to relieve the pain in my face and was surprised at how well it worked.  I've been using it ever since.  I probably wouldn't buy this for myself, but I'll steal it from my wife when she buys it again."
172,1,"I'm still a bit itchy_I really hate smearing lotion on myself, it's just not my thing, ya know... it absorbs quickly and doesn't leave a &#34;film&#34; of slime like a lot of other lotions do. I think I'm a special case when it comes to dry skin... I probably don't drink enough water, in fact, I know I don't!"
8198,1,Five Stars_Nice little device and just the right size.  I use it for masks and highlighting hair.
8588,1,This might make me give up my electric shaver_I've been using an electric shaver on my legs for years but notice that this gives me a cleaner closer shave than the electric.  I hated the way a razor would scrape my skin along with the risk of nicks but this takes shaving with a blade to a whole new level.  I don't have that awful scrapping sensation and the moisturization this puts on my skin as I shave gives my skin a healthy glow and makes the blades glide over my skin and leaves it like silk.  I was afraid there was going to be a slick greasy feel from this but there is just a soft smoothness on my legs like a good lotion would give them.  I'm very pleased with this razor and might switch to using this exclusively.
7911,0,In Bag Organiser ends up in the bottom_The soft sides of this case ended up as a clump of extra fabric in the bottom of my bag.  Truly not something you need in your life.

3373,0,"is it suppose to be for sensitive skin?_Ok so i started getting more than just a pimple here and there lately when before i only had to deal with one, so i began looking for an acne system for sensitive skin because my skin is too sensitive for the regular creams, i tried proactive before but it dried my face so i thought to try acnefree sensitive since one, it was cheaper, two, it claims to be better than proactive and three, the reviews look pretty good. Today is my third day of using it, on day 1- my face felt dry, on day 2-my face was peeling and my pimples look like they are getting bigger instead of smaller, day 3-im getting some kind of rash on my neck and its red and it itches alot (i washed my neck with it too) Is it suppose to be for sensitive skin? I doubt it, my skin is getting worse with this crap. Will i use it again tommorow? I dont think so, im afraid to now. Sometimes i wonder if acne creams really do work. What a waste of money-even if it was cheaper. Acne free is not for me."
4208,1,"Works great._This serum works very well.  I can barely see my 11's anymore and others can't see them at all.  It can slightly burn when you first start using it but, try every other day for a while if you have to.  It is truely worth it. I use my clarisonic at night, then this serum  and then moisturizer.  My skin has really improved.  I bought some blue bottles like these to put half of it in, wrap in foil and put in the fridge.  I got that tip off of youtube.  It seems this kind of serum will turn yellow before it lasts the estimated 3 months.  This way you will get your entire 3 months worth of treatment out of it.I will definitely order again and from the same seller."
6809,1,"Wow!_This is my favorite color out if all the lip butters that I purchased. It has like a brownish purple color to it,and its obvious that you have something on your lips but its not over the top, this would so beautiful with lip liner. So if your like me and like some color on the lips but love natural or subtle looks, then this would be a good item to purchase!"
9548,1,Best Dry Shampoo I've used_This is an excellent dry shampoo.  Use a squirt up near your roots and just work it in and it absorbes any grease that may be near your follicle base. It doesn't give any weight to your hair and is perfect for styling updo's on second or third day hair.  It smells really awesome too!
5694,1,"Great product, great service._This little bun maker really helps making the bun easier and holding it in place comfortably and stays all day."
966,0,"Dries Hair_I bought this because I freaked out when I started losing a lot of hair in the shower. Granted, I'm only in my mid-20s but this was recommended to me by a co-worker. The product, along with the shampoo, severely dried out my hair and caused more to fall out. My hair was weaker and easily broke. The smell isn't too bad (it smells minty) but it's hard to sleep and work smelling of mint 24/7. Worst of all, the bottle came half-empty/half-full. Thankfully, Amazon's customer service was responsive as usual."
5070,1,"Good Coverage_This makeup provides good coverage; it is buildable but I like a more &#34;natural&#34; coverage to let my freckles show through. That said, I have to be very careful not to put too much of the product on the applicator or it'll appear too heavy [SIDEBAR:  I do not use the little brush that comes with it, I use one that came with Pur Minerals instead].  This formula doesn't irritate my skin like other mineral makeups do.  The main issue I have with this is the packaging...you can tweak the coverage to suit you and I think for a &#34;drugstore&#34; brand this is probably the best mineral makeup out there, but the packaging leaves something to be desired. My shipment was received well before promised and intact!"
2668,1,"Wonderful Three-Ingredient, Non-Toxic Soap_I have used Kiss My Face for a number of years now because it is a non-tallow soap, and I'm a vegetarian. It has a benign, pleasant smell about it, despite having no fragrance. this isn't true of all simple soaps, for example Dr. Bronner's liquid soaps, which we have also used a time or two smell like old dirty french fries. Yuck.Since I've had kids who are woefully eczema-ridden, it's become even more important to find fragrance-free products which do not contain irritants. As one might expect, this soap is considered to be a 0 hazard by the Environmental Working Group's Skin Deep Database.So, my family of sentive-skinned folk hasn't had problems with allergies and irritation from this soap, but we have had problems with goo, mentioned by a number of other reviewers - especially when its in the kids' bathroom. When you allow this soap to sit in moisture it will create a sticky green slime that adheres itself to EVERYTHING. The kids tend to get the goo everywhere, and if you let the goo get out of control it will build up in the drains too. That's no fun. So, I do wish they would make the bars smaller, because the bigger the bar, the more the goo in my experience. However, with a little work, the goo can become less a problem. Adequate drainage is a must. We have managed to combat this problem with the kids by only doling out 1/4 bar at a time, and this is working amazingly well.So, for a non-toxic soap this one is - in spite of the goo - remarkable, it is affordable, accessible (it's in all the local grocery stores and is one of the few products I don't have to order online), works well, doesn't reek, and with a little managing can, in fact, be kept goo-free. We love it."
2890,1,"The best eyeliner hands down_I love this eyeliner, its by far the best I have used.Its smooth application, no smudging no racoon eyes and true black 'intense' color is perfect for me. I like a dark look and even with the brush they give you its amazingly easy to put on as thin or thick or a line as you would like.It nevers hurt my eyes, like some other eyeliners did.What I love the most is probably that there is no sharpening, which is the worst I hate haveing to sharpen eyeliner as I feel like I'm literally throwing away money. When I first purchased this I was worried about how much I was paying for such a small jar of product but trust me when I say that a little goes a LONG way. And although I suggest you change your eyeliner every 4-6 months this would probably last you at least a year.When applying this product I would sometimes go over it with a black powder on the lower lids so there was even more no smudging.Warning however...this product will be absolutly NO good if you leave the lid off the jar. Once you take the lid off and leave it for about 7 hours the product WILL dry out and the eyeliner will loose the creamy texture and when you try to apply it after that it will flake off."
1078,1,Awesome_Great wash! I use it twice a day. Love the creamy feel. Never dried out my skin but leave very clean feeling. Awesome
3524,1,"Came Early and Compact_I liked that this arrived a day early. Every thing came compact no hairs were shed and the brush top stayed on for me. Honestly I don't like how packed the brush is, I thought I would be getting something lighter; but that's just my opinion other than that the brush came exactly as expected."
9358,1,"Best thing I've used to eliminate calluses_Works extremely well on the callus on the side of my big toe, but for the sensitive skin on the tops of my feet I felt it was a bit too harsh.  For the softer skin, such as the tops of my toes, I have some great exfoliating gloves that I use while I'm bathing.  I use this Pedi-Rock on the bottom and sides where the skin is not so sensitive.  The exfoliating gloves coupled with this foot file makes my feet really smooth and young looking, better than you can imagine.  I'm over 50 but at least my feet look young now.  :-)"
5909,1,On yeah baby this is fine_The smell is a tad funky but wow. It hydrated my dry thick wavy mop well. Made it soft and silky. Only thing is my hair is way too thick and I suspect it may thicken it even more. But if you want thicker hair maybe not an issue for you.
2468,0,"Meh_Not thrilled. It's very greasy feeling, so I tend to not want to use it. I make myself so I won't waste it. But, it's not fun. Directions say to wipe off after 15 minutes; too inconvenient to me. Won't order a second time."
1919,1,Little goes a long way_This lotion straightens but does not weigh down your hair.  It works very well with the ceramic iron.  Put the foam in your hair and then immediately flat iron. Wonderful and inexpensive!
7582,1,I love them_They are good brushes I haven't had any problems with them but I had to throw one away cuz I didn't know acrylic liquid melts plastic and I used a plastic container to hold some in and put the brush in and ruined it so yeah they are great!
856,1,"A Floral Fragrance That Rivals Parisian Parfums_SJP's parfum collection is by far the most reputable celebrity fragrance on the market.Let me just say that I'm a sucker for a floral scent--especially one that conveys sophistication. The scent itself is very rich, yet subtle.The parfum's endearing quality is the fact that it outlasts a typical eight hour work day. For instance, I sprayed a test run on a sheet of paper in my bedroom. Surprisingly, the smell lasted for the entire day!I absolutely love this parfum!"
3215,0,"Love the Oil, Not a 6pk as advertised_Buyer beware this is not a 6pk as it is being advertised, it is only 1 .85 oil, and can be purchased cheaper elsewhere!! Dont waist your time or money with this false advertised item!"
6046,1,"Love it_I was a bit doubtful but wanted to try this, and was really pleased to see it works great. I'd have liked the barrel to have been a bit smaller for my medium length hair, but it does dry and give hair a nice shine and slight curl. I don't think it would work as well on thick hair unless smaller sections are used."
7663,1,very good........._This is an excellent conditioner for my fine hair. Makes it so soft. this is my favorite in addition to 'COLOR ME HAPPY by HERBAL ESSENCE.' I always buy it in bulk.
8419,0,"Smells great but stays on your scalp and does not rinse out_I have used Clear shampoo in the past and did not like the scent or the way it cleaned. However, after using a 7 day deep conditioner treatment by them, I wanted to give this a try.The scent is very nice! It seems clean and floral without overpowering. However, it does not lather well not does not rinse out well. I have medium curly hair and I could not get any lather out of this shampoo, only a great scent and semi clean hair. I noticed it left a layer on my scalp that would not rinse off no matter what. I will say though that it smelled fabulous but I want clean hair, not just clean smelling.I like the idea of frizz control and moisture balance but it was not there for me. Sadly, I will not be using this product again."
7036,1,"Super soft and smooth coverage!_I purchased this clay foundation after a horrible experience with BareMinerals new compact powder foundation. Sorry BM!!! I have somewhat dry-ish skin in the first place, so I don't know what I was thinking!Anyway, here is what I love about Tarte Amazonian Clay:The shade, 'Fair' is spot on for my pinkish pale skin.The texture is so unique, smooth and creamy, but not greasy at all! It has a great finish that is neither matte nor shiny. Just perfect.. maybe luminous? :)The coverage is perfect for me, but I wouldn't say FULL coverage. It is more like medium to full. I don't have acne problems, but there are definitely some freckles I would like to see go away, but I see hints of them under this foundation.It also probably doesn't last 12 hours. Maybe it's my job of teaching art to a bunch of kids all day, but it starts to wear off around hour 9 or so... Not to shabby though!The one thing I do not like about this is the price. I mean.. close to $40?? That is pretty high. Maybe I'm cheap (ok, I'm definitely cheap) but that just seems kinda much. I guess I'll have to put away a dollar a day or something! :)"
5519,1,CND Shellac top coat_First time putting on Shellac on my nails. This top coat is good. I've had it on nowfor a week and my nail polish is still on. I have no chips.
3638,1,"I dye my hair multiple colors...._So I bleach my strands a LOT, to get the colors I want. Palmer's protein along with their olive oil hair spray saves my hair every time. I just  dyed my hair deep blue, and there was a lot of shedding, well after applying this mask the shedding stopped immediately and my roots are stronger as well. I give it five stars!"
3668,1,"It is a perfect color_I never triedthis color before, thinking it would be too harsh for my skin tone! It looks great on me! When I run out I will be ordering again! Moist but not too moist and it has a nice matte to it as well, which I like!"
2579,1,Love it_I  am still using it and so far I love it. I don't use it every day but I like how it makes my face feel. I used it mostly at nights and sometimes I use it by itself. It has a smooth feeling to it even though it may seem as if it won't spread so easily. I use only four drops on my face total. It is not sticky or greasy and the smell goes away after a minute or so. No complaints so far...
5769,1,"A true Staple in any Woman's Beauty Bag!_BEST brush to have if you wear Liquid Foundations!!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.  Very easy to use on a daily basis, and very EASY to clean!!  I use Makeup Forever HD Foundation (liquid) and Sephora 10HR Wear Foundation (Liquid) and this is the ONLY brush I use.  real Techniques offers a great, affordable brush that's easy to use, anyone can afford it & use it.  I recommend this product to every girl who uses liquid foundations!! The soft bristles don't irritate my sensitive skin, and feels silky smooth when applying my product.  This was my first time buying a real Techniques product, and I have already purchased the Core Collection and Expert Face Brush as well.  The Stippling Brush has become a staple in my Beauty Bag, and I promise you, it will become yours as well once you try it!  Easy to use, affordable price makes it a REPEAT buy for myself and friends' birthdays & Holiday gifts!"
8585,1,"Very good for a disposable._I'm not a big fan of disposable razors, but the Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor is very good. It lacks the weight and feel of a non-disposable razor, but it still has good ergonomics. The hydrating gel reservoir makes shaving easy and smooth, without irritation. The razor also has a unique 'flip trimmer' which works well. The razor's 5 blades seem to stay sharp for long time, as I've used 1 razor numerous times already and it still seems good as new. The only real downside to the Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor is the cost. It's costs much more than most disposable razors, but you get what you pay for. It's among the best disposable razors I've used, and recommend it."
3467,1,"So Far So Good...._I waited FOREVER to try Eco Styler Gel and finally caved last week and decided to give it a shot. I was planning to try this product once my hair was longer, it's shoulder length (stretched) now but I thought more weight would give the product a better chance of working with my hair. But MahoganyCurls on YouTube just made that gel seem too good to be true! So I took the plunge. I bought the Krystal from the local drugstore. Krystal was not my first choice, so I was a bit frightened to use it. A clear gel with a hold of TEN?!!  That is scary stuff. But it didn't contain any alcohol and it was thick and rich like my Long Aid gel so since it didn't FEEL like regular styling gel, I hoped it didn't affect my hair like regular styling gel either.Anyway, I'm rambling. I used it the first time last week actually. I did my usual wash and over night conditioning treatment, then after rinsing my conditioner, I applied my Long Aid activator for moisture, as I've read and heard this gel can make your hair hard or dry if there's not enough moisture underneath. I like to use clear things in my hair anyway, because creamy or white coloured things make my hair white and that just irks me terribly. I used the smoothing method of applying this gel to my hair and almost instantly my curls started to clump and separate into beautiful little curls and waves. But anything makes my hair curly and nice when it's WET. The real test was what will it look like when it DRIES. So I went about my day and let my hair dried and to my surprise, it was wonderful!! It still looked great, there was only normal shrinkage, it wasn't dry or excessively crunchy.  I could tell there was gel in there, but it was pleasant. My hair had movement, it didn't take forever to dry either!!!But this was day one... What happens when I want to refresh? Yeah that's when it all falls apart. Nope... It stayed great. When I took my scarf off, my curls were still great. I spritzed it with a little water and put some oil on it and that was IT!! I shook it out and my hair looked GREAT! And this went on all WEEK!! One day, I didn't even put any oil on it, just a little water and went, still looked fabulous! I am hooked on this gel!! So much so, that I just ordered like 224 oz total of this stuff on here!! I got 4 32oz jars, and 6 16oz jars. I am stocking up!! LoL!!Plus if the Krystal- usually everyone's harshest, hardest gel is this wonderful, I'm willing to bet they are ALL wonderful! Maybe even better than the Krystal!(Free shipping on the Krystal swayed me away from the other 'flavors') I can't wait to try each and every one!!*Edit to add*:A couple of my jars were cracked. One the lid was broken, one the jar was cracked, but the rest were fine. I've heard this from other reviewers as well, so... Make sure to keep the old jars or something to put your gel in just in case it comes broken. They come sealed in a little green bag, so your gel shouldn't end up all in the box."
9118,1,Best nail polish ever_I love the color and the shine. In natural sunlight I have never seen anything so beautiful. This is what I would most definitely call a silver polish in low light condition however.
4421,1,"Love them!_I wear them alone under gloss/lipbalm for the most part. Great colors, slides on great. Lasts decently long :) Great price!"
2643,1,Works Wonderfully_I accidentally broke my old mirror and needed a replacement. Finally I found this one on Amazon and decided to order it.  The magnification is much better than my older mirror and it looks good in my bathroom.  Definitely would recommend this to anyone needing a mirror as a replacement or first time purchase.  Makeup application is much easier now.
3341,1,Nice product_It is a nice moisturizer and it works really well to give you a light tan that looks natural. I'm not a big fan of the smell though.
1730,0,"It feels nice when you apply it, but is it improving my skin? Ehhh..._So, I started using this product because I like other products from St. Ives.  I do like the way my face feels and smells when I use it.  I have been hearing that this product has a lot of mineral oil in it, and that mineral oil doesn't absorb into the skin or really do anything beneficial for you.  Obviously, it is really cheap product and you get a lot of it.  It's a good deal, but if it doesn't work, then what is the point?  I will say that I use it as make-up remover, and that is works great for that! I also use it in the morning with sunscreen and wrinkle cream, so I'm using a lot of other products in conjunction with it.  This is my second jar of it, so I did buy it again because I always thought that it did moisturize, but I think I may try another product after reading so many harsh reviews.  Also I haven't seen any visible results in it reducing fine lines or wrinkles at all.  I will finish the jar but browse other products when this product is gone because I'm not over the moon happy with it."
3325,1,"If you have dark circles_I have to be honest. When I first used this, I hated it. But I have learned a lighter hand is needed, I use it to counteract the blue/dark circles under my eyes, with a nice top coat of foundation or powder they all but disappear. I like my look to be seamless which is why I add the foundation. This is a great product, and the price is amazing. To all my dark circled sisters and brothers, this is the one for you."
3534,1,Creme_This is a pretty good creme.  It keeps hair in place.  I would check the ingredient if you use mostly natural products since this does have chemical.  This is a top seller because it works pretty good.
378,1,"Beautiful rosey pink color._I really love NARS blushes and I always am searching for the perfect color. I currently own: Luster, Albatross, Torrid, Orgasm and Taj Mahal blushes. I gave torrid a try because I am an light olive skin complexion (NC20-NC30) and I thought it would look great on me. With the Orgasm blush I have to layer it on with a pretty heavy hand and I wanted something I could use less of, but same color wise.I will def say I was a bit disappointed with the color, but maybe that was just my expectations. I was hoping that it would be a lot more pigmented that the NARS Orgasm, but in the identical color range. Sadly, It isn't.The orgasm blush is a peachy pink with golden sheen. Almost like a blush and highlight in one. The Torrid blush is burnt reddened pink with golden micro glitter. Not overly glitter, but very different that the golden sheen that Orgasm gives you. These differences might be good for you if you were looking for blushes that were in a league of there own, but I am not. I find that this blush typically lasts about 6 good hours on me. Just for reference I have combo skin, meaning I have a oily T-zone and regular skin type on my cheeks. Not dry and not oily.If you are looking for a blush that would compliment both lighter skintones and darker skintones, get Torrid. Don't be afraid of the color or how pigmented it is. Get a stippling brush or a synthetic brush and grab a bit of color and blend. You can always go back and get more color, but if you add too much at one time, you will get the clown cheek effect. I have to add that this blushes lasts a very long time. I have had it for about 2 years now and still have yet to hit pan.Update:I would like to also add that since buying this, it has gone up by a dollar.UPDATE #2: I still own this product and I have to say I love it because its different than my other blushes. I originally was hoping it was similar to another blush I own, but I'm now glad it's not."
9775,0,"Not a fan. OK smell, dislike the beads._It's another body wash. I think it's a bit expensive for what it is - just a basic body wash with a pretty good scent. The problem is the little exfoliating beads. They're kind of silly for a man who has hair - they just get caught up in the hair and don't exfoliate anything at all.To make matters worse, these plastic microbeads pollute the water supply - and I live on the shores of Lake Erie. I'd prefer a nice clean lake instead of cruddy exfoliants."
3149,1,"goodbye winter skin_This works SO well. I have horrifically dry skin and this product improves the feel of my skin after using. I use my Dove body wash or baroody olive soap (depending what I'm in the mood for), I put some on my skin and some on the glove, and it exfoliates so nicely. Some people have complained about the glove being a bit snug. I have small hands so this is not a problem, but I'm pretty sure you could still use this product without wearing it as a glove.I am very happy with it. I exfoliate a couple of times a week and my skin feels amazing after."
5270,1,Cult Classic_We used this product on our older kids on a recent Disney Cruise and were pleased with it.  But now the High School freshman daughter and her boatmates in crew have made a ritual of applying a stripe to their faces before races.  Seems to work.
1228,1,Favorite Perfume_This is my favorite perfume ever. I love the way it smells and you only need two squirts. I always get compliments on it and everyone always asks what it is.
3969,0,Not recommended for African American skin!_Did not like this product at all. Made my teenage daughter face break out really bad. This product I do not recommend for ebony skin.:(
8171,1,Bright and bold and fun for art._This is a very bright summer color and I used it alone on toes for a stunning pedicure and also with other intense ibd colors for a tie dyed leopard print nail. It has a good amount of pigment in it but also has a tiny bit of shrink back so swipe the edge before curing.
7739,1,I'm in love!!_I always always ALWAYS get this foundation beautiful on my skin med coverage highly recommendI have oily skin and it doesn't make my skin look glossy. In fact it looks matte!
3152,1,good_I really liked this salt. It smells good and it works really well. I use it after massages and really makes me feel good and I like the minerals contained within it.
4233,0,"Super disgusting ointment - this is not a cream_First off, before I ordered this product I was aware that not everyone loves it. I'm okay with that, and I figured I would give it a shot anyway since it's been around for so long and it's by Elizabeth Arden.I have to say that I have yet to be actually REPULSED by a product like I was by this one. The smell - Oh, heavens, the smell alone was enough to make me gag.The tube itself is on the smaller size and is nice and white, so you are expecting something luxurious to come out of it. But no! One squeeze and what comes out can only be described as something a mechanic would use to lubricate the parts of a car engine. It is really that gross. It's basically a yellow colored petroleum jelly, it smells somewhat like medicine, and it leaves an oily-type residue on your skin after you apply it. In summary, it's not a product I would apply anywhere on my body and I'm still in disbelief that people use this on their lips. But to each his own, I guess. For me this was not a good product and I would never order it again."
3079,1,"Awesome straightener and amazing deal!_I recently moved and found myself without my normal straightener. I turned to Amazon and was very happy with this find. The straightener works great, and came with a free bottle of argan oil which makes my hair INCREDIBLE soft. Even comes with a styling glove if you're prone to burning yourself (like me). Works well for straightening and curling. I was planning on going back to my old straightener brand since this one was intended to be a stopgap, but I'm going to stick to this one. Would recommend."
4709,1,Love it!_This powder is like nothing I have ever tried before.  It is fine and is very absorbent and leaves a beautiful finish.  THe finish it leaves is smooth and doesn't leave your face feeling like is has a thick mask on your face.  It is worth the price and I use it with the Primed and Poreless primers by two faced which are also great.
8837,1,"Dewy finish looks cute_Summer can be harsh and I wanted something that would help my makeup from disappearing at the first sight of humidity.  NYX  Dewy Finish does a great job of doing that.  Recently I was out and about in humid 80 degree weather and felt the heat, but to my surprise my makeup still looked fresh even after 3 hours of the sun.  When I first sprayed it on I felt like my makeup was being washed off, but it was not.  It was just the cool wet mist doing it's job to set it.  I didn't blot any excess off and I did get a dewy look which I loved.It did wear off by the end of the day, but this was a 10 hour day in the heat.  Without it my makeup would have been gone within an hour or two.  It lasted a good 4-5 hours in 99% humidity.  In normal conditions it has lasted a good 12 hours.  I love it!"
9754,0,"Not my favorite cream for my skin type_I am picky about the skin care products I will use on my face since my skin is quite fussy. It's both dry and acne prone and requires a diligent routine of prescription pills and prescription topicals as well as good over the counter cleansers, creams and serums to keep it looking healthy.  That said, having tried quite a range of skin products from high end to drug store I believe you can find really great cream at all price points.  Currently my favorite cream isNeutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Sensitive Skin, 4 Ounce, though it doesn't do anything for dark spots so I was curious to see if this product might unseat it as my go-to.Unfortunately based on my experiences with the product, I'm not sure it is the cream for me.  First, I wasn't a fan of the scent.  To me it smelled a lot like standard drug store shampoo and I just didn't love it.  Second, I didn't love how my skin felt after using it.  I do think the marketing is correct in saying this absorbs quickly, but it left a sort of chalky feel behind.  Personally I prefer a lotion that doesn't leave any residue behind because it leaves my skin feeling lighter and cleaner.  The chalky feel instead made my skin feel itchy and sensitive which I am trying to avoid.On the positive side, this didn't sting my skin and it doesn't feel dry and tight.  I haven't noticed any noticeable differences in the hyper-pigmentation I have from acne scars, but expect I would need well more than a month of regular use to see even subtle effects.  (However, I don't knock a cream for this.  The only thing that has delivered substantial improvement in my hyper pigmentation has been medical grade skin peels which are no joke.)Overall I can see where others might not be bothered by the scent or the chalkiness left behind, but it just wasn't for me."
615,1,good sunscreen_Got this after checking/ pouring over the Skin Deep website to find out about a safe sunscreen.  It works well doesn't take too much to rub in but you need to use a lot because it is not very creamy.  It does the job.
8406,0,"SERVES IT'S PURPOSE_What i don't like about them is that i did not get what was advertised.  I wanted what a saw in the picture, but instead i got two small jars with lids that serve it's purpose but not very cute.  I liked the fact that the two little jars in the pic got tiny lids on top with a little round handle to lift them up better with.  but the ones i received had no such thing, since they didn't cost must i let it go and kept them."
4335,0,"Not Worth It_This was the first ever highlighting kit I have ever used.  I actually researched highlighting kits before purchasing it from CVS and some fashion magazine (Glamor or Allure I can't recall) ranked it pretty high.First, using the cap is very hard since I wanted to use all the circled holes which was almost impossible to do.  I used a hand held mirror and stood in front of my bathroom mirror.  It is so hard to get all of the back holes especially since my hair is pretty long.Secondly, I performed the strand test 5 min. into waiting and saw that it was getting pretty light so I decided to wait an additional 5 min. I thought that would be enough time but after I used the provided shampoo, conditioner and blow dried my hair I saw no difference in my hair. I saw a review on CVS' website and another person had the same problem but left it on for 60 min. (the maximum time recommended in directions).  I guess it would not have mattered if I waited longer.  Such a bummer since I spent about 2 hours highlighting my hair with no happy end result.  Maybe I should contact Revlon."
2622,0,12 colors Boxed crushed shell_this was a total disappointment to me. I did not receive crushed shell powder I received glitter and not much might I add. On top on that I order 2 of the crushed shell and received one package of glitter. Would not recommend buying. I have contacted seller several times to give them the chance to make things right with no response. This product is a waste of your money .............................. WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN.
3227,1,Love the straightening of this product line_This stuff really gets the waves out! It is a nice way to straighten out the waves that was missed by my relaxer without over processing my hair.  It changes the texture and it straightens well enough that I do not have to flat my hair after using this product.  Definitely keeping this line of products around.  Thumbs up.
2869,1,"Love Burts Bees products_I am 51 yrs old and just started using Burts Bees, the entire line.  I LOVE their products!  I cant say any face cream, and ive tried eveverything, will take away lines and wrinkles, but it sure cant hurt.  Moisturize, mosturize and moisturize!  All skin types will be very happy with this product, in my opinion.  Im completely hooked on their line, price, quality, smell and overall i give them 100 stars!"
3422,1,Best top coat ever_This is such a great buy!  I will by buying again!  This is the best top coat on the market!  Dries super fast and there is no other that shines like this top coat does!
7323,0,"I preffer other shampoos_In the never ending quest for good anti-dandruff shampoos, I decided to give this one a try.  After a week of use, I am not too impressed.  It cleans well enough, has the same quantity of effective ingredient (1% zinc) as the others and does leave my hair looking good - but I am still not real pleased with this.  The big issue is that like many all-in-one products, my hair feels overly slick right after I use it.  I honestly feel like I should be shampooing my hair right after using this product.I think Head and Shoulder products are better over all and I will definitely not be buying this next time around.PASS!"
7648,1,Adorable_They are so adorable me and my 4 yr old daughter both used them they lasted a couple says but probably because I used 1$ nail glue and I adore the sturdy organizer pill box it came in
2230,1,"Good product_Good product which doesn't have a strong smell, it's appreciable. Small bottle but I'm not using it every day so it's good."
9091,1,"Very light scent_I thought all sunscreens smelled the same.  You know--that sunscreen smell.  This doesn't have that.  It almost doesn't have a smell at all and the smell that is there is not like the sunscreen smell that I know--it's more flowery.  I put it on my baby and it didn't leave a sticky or greasy residue.  She didn't get a sunburn, either, but we were only in the sun for an hour or so, so I'll need to be out in it longer before I can say for sure that it works just as well as any other stuff I've tried, but I don't have any reason to doubt thus far.  I like this--I'll get it again.Recommended."
787,0,"Too Harsh!_Not for dry or sensitive skin - much too harsh, strips the skin of natural oils leaving it parched and tight, which is sometimes a good thing, but this cleanser is much to strong for dry/sensitive skin."
3687,1,"Nice_Nice color, didn't do anything special..."
2388,1,"Great conditioner._I have all of the Silicon Mix conditioners, but this one is my favorite.  It has protein and my hair LOVES protein-containing products.  This product does contain mineral oil, so if that's a concern, this product is not for you.  Actually, I try to avoid products with mineral oil, but I make an exception for this product because it works so well with my hair.  I make sure my hair is very clean (almost squeaky clean) before using this product.  Then I saturate my hair with the conditioner, detangle with a wide tooth comb, and sit under a hood dryer w/ heat for 20-30 minutes.  When I rinse, I apply the leave-in conditioner of the same line and either roller-set or wet bun.  The hair comes out soft, smooth, well-conditioned, and with a nice sheen.  This is a staple deep conditioner for me."
1215,1,"A SOPHISTICATED ORIENTAL FRAGRANCE_Whoever said you can't tell a book by its cover hadn't seen the container Lagerfeld designed for this fragrance - its as lovely as the scent it holds.Adding to his popular fragrance, Chloe&quot; and his standby men's scent, &quot;Lagerfeld,&quot; Karl Lagerfeld introduced Sun Moon Stars in, I believe, 1994.While, to my knowledge it has not enjoyed the customer base that Chloe does, it is, nonetheless, an outstanding scent. It's an attractive blend of oriental and floral notes.True to his designer roots Lagerfeld presents it in a stunning bottle - a midnight blue frosted glass orb rimmed by motifs of the sun, moon, and stars."
8049,1,"Pretty Darn Happy with Results_Results and reviews for this product will likely vary depending on hair type and length.  I have long hair, which generally makes my hair look normal in thickness when I wear it down, but it's not.  My sides are more thin than the back and nape of neck area.  I use this product primarily (following the directions) on my scalp on the sides (above ears), my bang area and along my defined part.  These are the areas that I feel are the more thin and limp.  The amount you need to use will depend on your hair.  I probably use 4-5 pumps on each area  - carefully parting, spraying, and rubbing into my scalp when hair is damp.  I love this product because it is not thick, gel-like, sticky or irritating. I'm the kind of customer who can't stand using those type of products.  Oh sure, I have a counter full of them because I try many with hopes of it working, but goo, sticky or waxy just doesn't work for me.  Compared to other popular products, I do not think the scent is overwhelming or clashes with perfume or cologne.  If you've used other Pantene products, you can expect basically the same type of scent.  I am sensitive to many products and this does not irritate my scalp even during the dry, winter months.I recommend putting on damp hair and then blow-drying for best and fullest results.  I've put on damp hair and let air dry, but did not get the optimal result.  At first, I wasn't sure if I was losing less hair, but then I did notice my brush truly did have less strands in it, less on my shoulders after blow drying and less on the bathroom carpet.Will your hair feel and look super thick?  Um...no, but it will look like you're having a good hair day and you will notice less shedding hairs with use of this product.  Also, it did not make my particular hair, which is fine and dark look greasy at all.  I think if this occurs, just cut back on the amount you're using.  I will be buying and using this product in the future."
4348,1,Works great!_You'll need this for any gel system.  I used my Gelish phbond the first couple times I used my IBD system and thought I'd better try the IBD brand dehydrate and it works great!
524,0,"So Shiny!_OK, I officially don't understand what other women are looking for in makeup.  This product makes my face so shiny it looks I stuck my head in a deep fryer.  What am I not getting here?  Am I supposed to go to work looking like a human disco ball?  Being the lemming Amazon review reader that I am, I also wasted my money on that box of glitter that is Bare Minerals and had the same problem.  Shine fest all over my face.  In the future I will stick with Revlon powder and leave the expensive stuff to the rest of you girls."
9566,1,"shape, size and consistency more of a plus than smell_first, when products offer emotional benefits, like this one does, beware.  this means a lot has gone into advertising this product, maybe everything.  this product is not bad but in an already very crowded market of shower based cleaning products, this one is not some vast improvement entering that market. one of the main things customers look for in this kind of product is smell, especially when emotional benefits are touted.  i agree with the other reviewers here that the smell is not a plus.  it reminds one more of mouthwash than anything spiritually edifying (as promised).however, it does have plusses for the health club environment. because of the shape of the plastic container and the thick gel consistency, this is very good for throwing into your gym bag or travel kit.  it fits your hand well in the shower and it will be hard to leak onto your other clothing because of its gel consistency. it cleans fine and leaves no noticeable odor on the skin. mine is now in my swim bag for use in my health club's locker room."
3317,1,"Huge tube - nice gradual tan for fair folks_I got the Fair to Medium.  I'm a fair girl and rarely get any sun.  This smells like self tanner, but in a milder way, but you can still recognize the scent if you've ever used self tanner before.  It's a wonderful consistency of lotion, and this tube is really huge.  It has definitely softened my arms up nicely :)  On to the self tanner part - I have used this repeatedly over the last four days - putting on a fair amount and rubbing in well a couple times a day.  My arms are achieving a gentle brown look, so it is a very gradual process, which I do like.  However, if you were looking for a quicker tanned effect, you'd have to go to the next darker shade.  I do like that it rubs in easily and dries completely probably within 10 mins. (and it's just a little sticky for the first five).  I wash my hands afterwards, and haven't had any darkening of my palms.  No streaks, no splotches.  I think the fact that it is a gradual tanner (tanner with lots of lotion to cut the &#34;instant&#34; effect) makes it more forgiving.  Really soft skin afterwards, but you will have a little bit of that self tanner smell for a while, and even after several hours you will still be able to smell it on your skin.  Might buy again, but I basically got it because we are going to Disneyland next week, and I wanted a little color.  This tube will last forever."
6321,1,"Clean and Clear_I am very satisfied with this product, it gave me the clean I was looking for and has a very pleasant smell."
2310,0,"Greasy_Hate it...thought I would love it because it is Dr.Bronners. There is no coconut smell, just over powering lavender. Put it in my freshly washed hair and it made it look and feel like I hadn't washed my hair in a week. It doesn't matter how much or how little I used, always makes my hair greasy and gross."
4808,1,"Nice to have a 'green' dish washing product_I really care about using safe, green products, and these packets work as well as the name brand dish washers that pollute. VIVA!"
8732,1,"Pretty good_Great looking clip , size is perfect and looks everpn brighter and shinier than in the picture. Its a little more darker blue than shown."
4747,1,"Long lasting_When this is used with the All season curing spray you get a smooth, shiny finish that dries quickly.  It can be buffed if it is not as smooth as you would like."
3674,1,"Awesome colors for smokey eyes._Ive been using this little eyeshadow quad gem for a couple years now (Natural Smokes). I love the colors, and use them pretty much everyday for a natural, beautiful brown smokey eye look. I rarely purchase drugstore makeup but this stuff is great! Use with an eye primer, brushes and you are good to go. Hope they keep these colors! You can find this at Wal-mart, or any other drugstore so don't pass this one up."
7018,1,"Just great!_Great quality, gorgeous bright orange color, which is rare to find as a cream eye shadow even in high end products."
3940,1,Just what I ordered!!_I got my BH Cosmetics Palette today! It's so beautiful!! Not a single one was broke so I am thrilled. I can't wait to actually use this. Yay!!
5896,1,Love it._I really love this mascara and it is such a reasonable price I will defiantly keep buying it for sure
37,1,"Awesome!_My mother and I both love this (she's in her early 50's, i'm in my early 20's). This leaves our skin soooo soft and feeling moisturized and hydrated without an oily slick. She has eczema and this goes very well on her skin, I have very sensitive combination skin and this has never broken me out at all. In the winter I have also applied this during AM hours to keep my skin from feeling dry during the day. We love this and highly recommend."
9325,1,"Soft bristles, flawless finish_I recently had the opportunity to review this product..Now..as I tested this awesome Kabuki Angled Brush I had to feel the texture.. let me tell you its soooo soft! it has dense soft bristles and its such a compact easy to flow brush, The synthetic fibers are ideal to be used with liquid, cream and powder products and can be easily cleaned,I just love it! I couldn't stop fiddling with the brush..so I had to give it a test drive!  I applied my liquid foundation on and it absorb enough for me to use less and blend moderately with ease, then I applied my mineral base powder and it felt flawless! I love how easy it was to blend with this brush. I sure recommend this kabuki angled brush to all the ladies who want to have a flawless finish look.#SimplyEssentials #AD"
9392,1,"good product for my skin_got this for my mom,  this is what she told me : the vitamin C serum absorbs very quickly , not oily feeling, it makes my skin looks more brighten. My face looks radiant and feels hydrated, In the second week I notices my skin was firmer. Now is part of my daily routine Im enjoying the results"
7174,1,"Good lip color good price_This is such a pretty color. The color comes off as a true vivid pink... no red in it... no purple... just bright barbie pink. Its long lasting especially for the price, hell its long lasting for any lipstick for that matter. I put this on over a lip balm because for me its not very moisturizing. I does not bleed on me, but I have not worn it in extreme heat so that may affect the bleeding. It has a very faint 'lip stick smell' like the kind of lipstick your mom may have had... but you either have to have a great nose, or be right up on the product to smell it. If you are considering this product I say go for it... but go for it in the drugstore for a better price.Disclaimer: I give this one star based on the price. Regular price in the store is $2... and with a bogo its even cheaper. This company is robbing you people."
5986,0,Causes frizz like look_Immediately returned. The krimper is ultra fine and makes your hair look like pubes. I would not recommend purchasing this product unless you're going for that frizzy look that gives you volume.
6561,1,"Smells so GOOD!_I love this lotion.  Had it at the Hyatt hotel and had to get a bottle, also bought the shampoo and conditioner.  Unlike most hotel lotion, this is very nourishing and the smell is very fresh and citrusy."
5686,0,recieved wrong one_I wanted this one but received the 10 years younger the sku sticker said bridal but the bottle said 10 years younger
89,1,"noticeable improvement in my skin_I usually have sensitive skin; one of the few scented products I can still use is body wash (probably because you rinse it off right after you apply it).  I don't really have issues with body acne, and never have, but I did have some issues with the appearance of the skin on my upper arms.  I figured a body wash of this type would be less likely to aggravate the skin, and might actually lead to an improvement in my skin's appearance (for example, by killing bacteria on the skin's surface).  First I tried the regular (orange-colored and unscented) Neutrogena Body Clear wash and it didn't really do all that much for me.  The grapefruit wash was a different story.  In combination with some Amlactin body lotion, this stuff has made a huge difference in the appearance of the skin on my upper arms.I happen to like the fragrance, although I understand that's going to differ from person to person.  (If you want to know what your own reaction will be, go sniff some in a drugstore before buying!)  Because this does contain some plant extracts, colors, and fragrances, it may not be ideal for people who have reacted to other products with the same ingredients (listed below for reference):Active Ingredients: Salicylic Acid (2%) (Acne Treatment)Inactive Ingredients: Water, Sodium C14 16 Olefin Sulfonate, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Acrylates Crosspolymer, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Polyquaternium 7, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Roman Chamomile) Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Carrageenan (Chondrus Crispus), Agar, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C), Propylene Glycol, C12 15 Alkyl Lactate, Polysorbate 20, Alumina, Butylene Glycol, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Benzalkonium Chloride Solution, Sodium Benzotriazole Butylphenol Sulfonate, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxides, Red 30 (CI 73360), Red 40 Lake (CI 16035), Violet 2, Mica, FragranceSome of the negative reviews have me puzzled.  While I don't dispute that someone might have an allergy to one of the ingredients or a sensitivity to salicylic acid, I'd like to set the record straight about a couple of things.First, this is a body wash and should be treated as such.  This means washing it off in the shower or bath after applying it (and not leaving it on and letting it dry).  It is not a spray or a cream.  It does not contain any ingredients that cause bleaching effects (I have a PhD in biochemistry and write patent applications for a living so I am familiar with the ingredients and what they do).  It is not difficult to get the last portion out of the container; simply store the container upside down when you are getting near the end.At any rate, I am quite happy with this body wash as it is having the intended effect in my case.  I will purchase more when my current bottle is used up."
4358,1,"Great for my long hair_I've had fabulous luck with this shampoo.  I have long, dry, coarse hair.  I've used HE Hello Hydration before, but never any of the others.  I picked up this one a week ago, and I've been thrilled with how it works.  The formula is really thick.  Most importantly for me, when I lather up with this shampoo my hair doesn't tangle- it slides right back into place.  It moisturized well and my hair felt fabulous both wet and dry.  I'll definitely be trying out the matching conditioner."
6938,1,Good cheekys plates_good cheekys plates...Muy bueno me encantaron los plate y yegaron muy rapido antes de la fecha de envio ya creo q voy a compra mas de esta compania
9623,1,"Smells great, leaves skin smooth and clean_I absolutely love this product.  It looks and smells like lemon pie filling, but the scent is mild and not at all overwhelming.  It is easy to use and leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.Best of all, it doesn't contain those little bits of polyethylene (plastic) that so many facial scrubs are using these days.  I find the idea of washing little pieces of plastic down my sink and into our water supply disturbing, so I am happy to find a high quality product that doesn't contain them."
6477,1,"Deep Porous Wipes_These handy, unscented cleansing wipes have deep pores, creating a soft, yet abrasive exfoliating surface. The twenty-five moist wipes in each moisture-retaining, resealable package are a convenient, effective and refreshing solution for cleaning neck, face and ears.It states to avoid contact with eyes, while within the package's bullet points it claims to be safe for sensitive eyes and contact lens wearers; I will just keep from wiping it over my eyes.These are to be disposed of in the trash, not flushed down the toilet - it's easy to tell that these substantial wipes are not water soluble.Simple adds restoring Vitamin B5, moisturizing Vitamin E and soothing Aloe Vera to these exfoliating facial wipes for a gentle satisfying clean."
2182,1,"Your lashes will thank you._I own this in Brown/Black. I can't feel bad putting this product on! Olive oil is sooo good for penetrating the lash and moisturizing it. (Not to mention that sensitive eye area being soft as a baby's tush). I havn't had any lash breakage or anything since using this! I don't know about the 400% thing, but my lashes are a lot stronger. You should have a powerful makeup remover too however, because this stuff is hard to get off!"
1006,1,"Acne at 30-something? Really?!?_This is one of the best face washes I've ever used. It smells good AND it's great at tackling my occasional breakouts (and, yes, to my dismay I still somehow manage to break out occasionally, despite being well past acne-appropriate age) - and also does a great job at preventing breakouts."
5246,1,Stunning Shades_The picture really doesn't do this product any justice. The shadows are really beautiful and nicely pigmented. You get a really nice selection of colors and they really do make light eyes pop (my eyes are light hazel and it looks great). I have no complaints.
7744,1,Great for eyebrows_I usually use this to come my eyebrows before during and after penciling my eyebrows or tweezing. I have unruly eyebrows and my hairs are usually all over the place so this actually tames them so I can be able to do my eyebrows
8908,0,"Nyx Liquid Illuminator_As the previous person said, you are buying like half air with this product. Since I purchased it from Ebay, I was a bit worried that I got ripped off since they said it was brand new but apparently, that is what a new bottle contains. Not only that, I was immediately disappointed that it was just sparkles and little/ no pigmentation on my skin. Granted that my skin is difficult by nature since I have a yellow undertone and I have really bad dark circles- it looks bad even on my forehead. For now, I'm just going to use it over and maybe under my blush if I want to sparkle. Glad I bought it cheap and didn't waste too much money though. I was really hoping to have a positive encounter with this product."
4241,1,"Great Buy_Pros: Lots of nice features; fold up handle and retracting cord. Really does make my hair feel soft and seem healthier.Cons: It's not as lightweight as I would have hoped or some other reviews have said. It's also not as quiet as other reviews have stated, the noise is average, not any quieter or louder than others that I have owned.Overall, I am happy with it, especially for the $25.00 price.Update 04/16/13 - owned for over a year and still going strong."
6887,1,"Good selection_These are great nail brushes for the beginner nail artist. I just use them for fun, and only occasionally, so I don't know how durable they are. But they have done well so far with the things I have done, and I love that there is a variety so I can try new designs out!"
7593,1,"Two uses_I love this eyeliner. First, it works great for it's intended purpose. It's a dramatic gel liner that stays put for the most part. It rubs a tiny bit but this can be remedied with a primer.I like the effect of the line though as it's not as harsh as a regular liquid liner, too dry and harsh looking, and it doesn't rub all over the place like a pencil.  For that reason alone, I love it!My other use for it though, is what I swear by this stuff for. I use it to cover my gray roots  when my colored hair is growing out. I use a stiff kabuki brush ( think one that comes in drugstore mineral powders ,mine is from Physician formula) and I dip the kabuki brush in the pot and get a small part of my brush covered in pigment, I apply to my roots and it covers my grays wonderfully and doesn't rub off or wash out until I wash my hair. (it also helps the stiff gray hairs lay flat) Prior to this, I was using some expensive product that while it worked well, it was sending me to the poor house, think 30 dollars ever few weeks.  One pot of this lasts much longer."
2829,1,"Best shampoo and conditioner!_I have been using Alterna Caviar products for about five years. The first time my stylist recommended them, I was taken aback. 'Aren't these products for white people?' I asked (I am black). She told me to just use them and I did ... and was hooked!This duo has been an integral part of my healthy hair journey. The shampoo is sulfate-free (which is a requirement in my book) and the conditioner works like no other. I urge anyone thinking about trying Alterna to try the sample sizes. I am sure you will be hooked afterwards!Healthy hair is an investment I am willing to pay a premium for! Alterna may be pricey ... but it is worth it!"

9029,1,"Lavender Shea Butter_OMG... it smells so good. You have to be careful when you buy lavender scented items. Lavender can have a slightly bitter smell if you don't get it from the correct place and it can also have a sugary confection smell too if the manufacturer tries to offset the bitter twinge with some scented additive. This butter gets it just right.Shea butter is a great product. I live in a dry climate and as the weather gets cold my feet get extremely dry. To the point where they have cracked. And on my feet it isn't dry heels, but the soles of my feet crack and for someone who likes to workout, this is a nightmare. My pedicurist said I should use shea butter on my feet and then put on socks and sleep with it.I have to admit I couldn't really picture oily feet in bed, but on the contrary it soaked right in. There was no greasy feeling and no residue on the sheets in the morning. I have however, designated those socks as my new &#34;shea butter socks&#34;, but I was willing to make the sacrifice.So I am very happy with the quality of the product and I will also mention one other thing using natural products is important to me, so I was happy to find this organic version of shea butter and not fall for the &#34;chemical&#34; brands out there.If you are thinking about giving shea butter a try and have not tried a scented shea butter before... this is a great place to start."
1197,1,"Was a sceptic after reading reviews but._I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FROM THE COMMERCIAL THEN READ THE REVIEWS AND THOUGH OH MY GOSH WHAT HAVE I BOUGHT.  BUT TO BE HONEST SO FAR I HAVE SEEN A DIFFERENCE IN FIRMING AND MY LAUGH LINES AND LINES AROUND MY EYES ARE MUCH LESS NOTICIABLE.  THE ONE THING I AM CURIOUS AND IF SOMEONE CAN LET ME KNOW IS THERE OTHER PRODUCTS YOU CAN USE WITH THIS OR IS IT ONLY THEIR PRODUCTS?  THE LOTION YOU PUT ON BEFORE USING THE WAND CAN IT BE ANOTHER PRODUCT?  JUST CURIOUS.  BUT SO FAR HAPPY I WAS HONESTLY GOING TO CANCEL THE ORDER BUT SO FAR HAPPY WILL KEEP YOU POSTED.

9836,1,"A rose is a rose...._Vitamin C serums are all the rage right now and what&#8217;s not to like? Organic, natural beauty products that actually work? Yes, please! But if you are like me you think mostly in terms of citrus fruits as prime sources of Vitamin C. Like me you would be wrong! The fruit of the wild rose, or rose hips, have been eaten for centuries for their Vitamin C to ward off scurvy and other ailments when citrus fruits were not available. Rosehip oil is particularly good for circulatory problems and so I first looked to InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil for increasing the blood circulation in my face. Better blood circulation mean better cell repair and smoother brighter skin.This 100% pure, certified organic, Rosehip Seed Oil by InstaNaturals contains no fillers and comes in a large 4 ounce bottle. More than twice the size of the usual Vitamin C serum.  Just 2 or 3 drops massaged into the face and neck will hydrate, reinvigorate and even skin tone. However, it may be the exception that proves the rule, &#8216;a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.&#8217; It does not. Rosehip Seed Oil smells, well, kind of yucky. The scent dissipates quickly though and is certainly not so unpleasant that I wouldn&#8217;t use it at all. It&#8217;s just that it is a natural product with not added chemical fragrances so it doesn&#8217;t smell they way we have too often come to expect beauty products to smell. Fake. And to our detriment.The price makes this oil just right for a Vitamin C serum that can be used all over the body. InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil works well on scars and stretch marks, and trust me, I had plenty to test the theory. I found the serum works quickly on newly formed scars but is no slouch with old scars and blemishes either. If I were pregnant I would never be with out this product. Not just to get belly rubs but to help prevent stretch marks.I found Rosehip Seed Oil a bit heavy for my hair but it worked miracles on my cuticles and the heels of my feet. My feet get so dry that sometimes my feet are more hooves than anything human. Liberal application of InstaNatural Rosehip Seed Oil right after a soaking bath has made them so soft and baby pink I almost want to show you a picture. (Almost.) I just rub the oil into my feet after soaking and exfoliating, pull on some cotton socks, and hit the bed. The next morning, no more angry bird talons! That&#8217;s a product worth its weight in gold during sandal season.Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial."
8349,1,"Dove Men+Care Hydrate + Face Wash_My husband laughed at me when I ordered the Dove Men+Care Hydrate + Face Wash.  He was never going to use this.  Then, he started using it and fell in love with how smooth it made his face.  He'll never use another product again, this was amazing, a great buy."
5133,1,"Awesome Product!_Fake Bake Flawless gives you a natural looking tan. The color is not orange. You will get a bronze, brown tan with this product! I received mine quickly and I also got a great price from this seller! You can control how deep you want your tan by multiple applications. You will need to exfoliate your skin first to prepare for your tanning experience. Also, moisturizing your skin will help to prolong your tan. This product is really awesome! I will definitely continue to use Fake Bake Flawless...."
8010,1,Natural lashes_These lashes are natural looking and they are inexpensive. These are a MUST BUY if you are looking for natural lashes. The only problem I had was it took a little longer to get to me; even though it comes from China ( I believe) I ordered these lashes with some other things that came from China and I got those before I received these. But I do love them!!!!
4368,1,"Very Fine for Sensitive Skin_This soap is sold with a very easy to use pump-type dispenser. The soap foams nicely and has a pleasant and undemanding fragrance. I am quite allergic to most body washes, but this example caused no problems. It seems to be a very delicate and useful body wash for those with sensitive skin."
4039,1,"Works_I like these bottles for travel. I recently filled one of these with my sensitive skin cleanser to use as hand soap during an overseas trip. I am happy to report that the bottle didn't leak (didn't fill it all the way though to allow for air pressure changes during flights) and it did what it was supposed to and what was advertised.I now plan on using another one for CeraVe cream to take along in my purse as hand cream (CeraVe regrettably stopped making its practical 2 oz bottles) but I will probably still put it in an extra ZipLoc bag, just in case because the lid is just a flip top.The only thing that does not work well on that bottle is the suction cup. It actually does not work, period. In my opinion they could do away with it completely, thus making the bottle sleeker as well. My one star deduction is for that. Other than that: Recommend.UPDATE 2/2014:I am still happy with the product but sadly it does not work well with thicker creams because I cannot get the cream into the bottle without major hassle. The opening is too small to even get an espresso spoon through. I was left with trying to use a funnel, which of course predictably did not work great either because thick creams tend to stay put and gravity does not work its magic too well... Conclusion: These bottles work better for thinner stuff such as liquid soaps and lotions."
8569,0,"Excessive Shedding_I was so excited to try this shampoo/conditioner but I am very disappointed. I have long fine/thinner hair and this has given me nothing but bad hair days for the past 3 weeks. I keep using it because I hate to waste it. It makes my hair look flat and lifeless. I even feel like my hair has been shedding way more than usual. It seems to have so many good reviews, but I guess everyone is different. I really don't recommend for anyone with fine hair, you will be disappointed."
6222,1,"Perfect color, a little drying._Perfect nude pink/light pink! I love the color but I def have to apply a lip gloss over it or else shortly after it turns my lips all dry and cracky/peely looking."
3590,0,"Way Darker than Pictured!_Was so excited , I couldn't wait for these to come.. But, they ended up being WAY too dark blonde, with a lot of brown in them. I was disappointed, too,when I contacted them, They said i would have to pay return shipping! No Way! I already spent enough money ,on this piece of crap.. Was pretty annoyed with them.. and, that Jessica Simpson would have her name attached  to this.. I guess she doesn't care.. She's already made enough money.. Btw, Jess, stay with singing.. and forget acting, if your Weight Watchers Commercials are any indication of your acting &#34;talent&#34;! :P"
2508,1,"Super thick_Smells clean and has a nice, thick application, which many other foot creams do not provide.  Keeps feet comfortably moist, but not greasy."
9368,1,"Works great on my hair_I've tried Argan Oil before and some made my skin soft, and others not so much. This argan oil worked better on my hair than my skin. UNi argan oil made my hair feel soft when it was dry. I really liked how it made my hair feel, and how it made it easier for me to detangle my hair.Overall, I like UNi Argan oil on my hair it make it feel soft, and that's what my natural hair needs.Received complimentary, all opinions expressed here are my own"
6945,1,Love it!_This is one of the best primer I have ever tried.  It smothers your skin in an amazing way. It completely diminish the look of big porous.  It's better than a lot of other expensive primer at there.I am a big fan of this product now and is so inexpensive.You use only a tiny bit at the time.
4161,0,"i hated it._didn't like it because it didn't match my skin and they don't make anything darker than this shade, so it looked white and cakey. im sure it would be fabulous on the person who finds shade."
3813,1,Highly pigmented!_Love the colors in this palette. I have both the warm and cool palette. The warm is my most favorite because it's mostly matte. The palettes last for a long time. I've had mine for more than 8 months and have yet to exhaust any one color. Comparable to MAC and Bobbi Brown at a fraction of the cost. Very impressed. I apply with brushes from Elf Cosmetic for flawless application. Wonderful color combinations for smokey eyes.
7651,1,"Nice, cheap_Works great. I was looking for something inexpensive, this fit the bill. Works well with a bit of soap to clean nails."
1375,1,"I keep this on my kitchen counter year around_My mom always kept a big bottle of Vaseline Intensive care close at hand. I tried that, but with my son's eczema, daughters dry hands in the winter, and dry skin in general...I needed something better.I bought this pump tub over a year ago, it is still going strong. We put it on after hand washing, slather it on dry legs, and rub it on our faces when they feel a little wind or sun burnt.It is fragrance free, gentle and is the equivalent of using something like petroleum jelly without the grease or mess.I even like the simplicity in the label so I don't mind it sitting on my counter."
1667,1,Amazing_This makes my hair so soft and manageable. Great product and wil continue to use but hope the price goes down.
6990,1,Scalpicin_I only need a dab once in a while but it really does the job.I think my hair spray may irritate my scalp.
7104,1,I am a Neutrogena_fan! I love how it smells (strong grapefruit smell for those sensitive to scents). he only thing I didnt like is that raw feeling after removing my eye makeup BUT its also very VERY waterproof and I have found that its best to use something oil based to get the liner off then follow up with a full face wash with these cloths....
8625,1,"Gentle_This gentle shampoo comes in an easy to handle, elegant ice blue bottle. Formulated with deep sea minerals and anti-oxidants, it promises to clean and soften hair without weighing it down.The shampoo has a pleasant fruity aroma. A little generates a alot of lather. It rinses cleanly and easily. My hair was left soft, clean and manageable. While I can't say that my hair was the promised 85% fuller, it did look and feel nice.  This product is sufficiently gentle for daily use.There are less expensive shampoos available. However, if like me, you rely on daily shampooing to guarantee  the body of your fine hair, this is an option to be considered."
453,1,"Haven't quite figure them out yet, but they seem to work nicely_I bought these because I've been looking for a new curlers set since the last two I've purchased either wouldn't get hot enough or were too cheap and wouldn't stay in my hair. I like that the curlers have a foam base so they form around your hair perfectly. It's a bit different to have to heat each curler individually before use, and the learning curve on it seems to be a little bigger than I anticipated. However, it does heat the curlers very hot and quite quickly. In the time it takes me to figure out how I want a curler in my hair, the next one is ready to go, so I it really doesn't even affect anything. In the photo you will notice the base piece. It works by filling the inside of the base with water, about half way, and then placing one curler on the top for steam to make the foam curler hot. Then you remove the foam curler, use it as you like to create the curly look you're going for. I suggest putting a new one on the steam base prior to putting the hot curler in your hair, so by time you're done the new curler is ready to go. The set comes with a nice plastic bag with handles to store all the pieces of the product in.My only real issue is the clips that they curlers come with. When I use them on my top layer of hair, I notice that my hair will get a flat 'crimp' in it at the base of the curl and I'm not a fan of how that looks. To fix that I've been using my own clips on my top layer of curls. Thus, now my only issue is just practicing and perfecting my use of them. I've read other reviews where people wore the foam curlers to bed, I have no idea how they do that because even though they're foam, they have hard plastic circular ends that I feel would be uncomfortable to lay your head down on... then again mom always said pain is beauty."
4301,1,"Quality & Affordable Brushes, once again..._YAY!!!! Received my brushes two days ago and was pleased with the variety. This set is just what I wanted because it solely focuses on precise eye make-up. I can't wait to use them!"
8983,1,"IMAGE is the best skin care ... period_Image is my favorite line for skin care and even my doctor makes a big deal on how awesome my skin looks! I am 41 and thanks to good DNA and the Image line I do not look it! This is well worth every penny, because no one knows I suffer from melasma and acne, not to mention it helps freeze the aging process!  I use Vit C, Ageless cleanser, Ormedic lip care, and some others I change out from Image depending on the season. It is affordable compared to other lines and is dermatologist grade (not the horrible drug store stuff). I cannot say enough good things about Image!!!"
3142,1,"Fun._I find I want to give my eyebrows some definition that they lack, being blonde, so have been experimenting with a variety of these products. It is helpful to moisturize the area before applying these things, and actually it is a good idea anyway, especially in areas of the country that are dry or have notable heating seasons. (I've noticed that we may put moisturizers on our faces and somehow miss the eyebrow area, which needs it just as much.) So the color part of the stick goes on more easily and effectively. I don't want my eyebrows to have that drawn-on look; rather want to color the individual hairs. This product works well.Now the nearly white waxy stuff on the other end of the tube - that is to play with. Hmmm. Maybe I can enhance that attractive look we eyebrowless-appearing natural blondes have. So I play with it, under or over the brows. Very soon I find that something written by another reviewer whose friend commented that she looked as though she had snow on her eyebrows, has happened. Well, that's the better interpertation of how it looks, because when I checked in the mirror, the stuff gave the impression of a dandruff-like skin condition, ha ha. So perhaps it is wise to experiment with the waxy end at home when you have plenty of time to check the results rather than just the old dab-and-run routine."
8887,1,Worth every penny...._I have tried so many moisturisers and none of them have really worked. They all left a tight feeling on my face until now. This moisturiser is perfect. Nice smell and you only need a little. I don't find it to be greasy because the consistency is not runny but firm. I use this day and night. It does not make my foundation slip. Haven't noticed any wrinkles leaving but my face feels great so I'm happy.
5243,1,"works great_Great colors, lasts long and makes your eyelashes appear fuller with no clump. I got this for my daughter and she loved it."
994,0,"No, no,no_I don't know if I got a false one, but it just does not work at all. It is a sheer tint that disappears so quickly it is not even worth putting it on. I gave it to one of my secretaries."
4123,1,love this product_The price and effectiveness of this product is great.  It's in a small container but I am sure it will last long. Thanks NYX!
1090,1,SO FAR SO GD_I LIKE THE WAY IT FEELS & GO ON MY BDY DNT C RESULTS YET BUT IM SURE I WILL  I USE DAY & NITE THANX
8592,1,"Great Razor_These razors are amazing! The hydro silk conditioner didn't last very long, but the razors themselves are still wonderful! Would definitely recommend to a friend."
4800,0,"Not what I expected_I read all the reviews and even saw Youtube video's showing how awesome this was. I got it and it did nothing for my hair. My ceramic straightner does better curls than this thing. I have natural wavy hair and have been straightening my hair and wanted to add some waves or curl into it, but this didn't do anything to help that matter"
7627,1,Works Well_This works well. The included attachments cover all nail needs. I find it easy to use. Amazon Prime snipping and packaging was great.  I would order again.
7350,1,"Excellent_I like this very much, it does make the process alot easier good price for it too.  Took a little too long to ship in my opinion, but still worth money paid for this item, so very reasonable."
9192,1,Five Stars_Good design and well made.
1644,1,"all the reviews are correct, this rocks._my poor cuticles, so dry and abused, i use badger balm and that works, but its greasy so i can't always use it. this is a great in between. i use it daily, already noticed a huge difference. as usual, OPI knocks it out of the park."
708,0,"Not Ideal for Natural Hair_Doo Grow Thickening Hairdress received 2 stars for several reasons.  First, the price is a rip off.  I saw this same product at the local dollar store for $4 less than what it is selling for here.  Secondly, because I was looking for a hairdress without many harsh chemicals and one that was ideal for 4b type hair, I was disappointed to see that petroleum is one the first listed on the ingredients list.  As research shows, petroleum is not good for most individuals with 4b type hair because petroleum blocks pores of the scalp resulting in slow hair growth.  Third, the product is thick and makes my hair greasy even if I use a small amount.  For every negative characteristic, I deducted one star.  The main good quality about this product is that it has a nice smell.  For African American women looking to transition to natural hair or who already have natural hair, I would not recommend this product."
3607,0,"WOAH!!!_Somehow I missed the detail that this was a 'tingle' product.  I thought I was having a severe allergic reaction and rode all the way home from the tanning salon with the windows open and the air conditioning on full blast.  I was rouge everywhere that I'd applied this stuff.  Btw, it smelled delicious.  Anyway, I definitely do NOT have sensitive skin otherwise.  I know a lot of people like the tingle products and if you're one of them, you'd love this.  If you're experimenting, don't start at this level.  I only used it once so I'm hoping to sell it to one of my tanning friends."
6591,1,"Works Great!_My mom and I both have one and we love it! Easy to use (a bit painful at first, but you get used to it!) and a small size to not take up much room in the drawer! We use ours all the time and they work great! Xxx"
1930,0,"clumps, hurts sensitive eyes_I really don't like this mascara. I guess it doesn't clump for everyone, but it does for me. The formula seems maybe a little too 'wet', so as soon as the brush goes by, the lashes closest to each other stick together instead of defining each lasg. For some reason I also tend to hit my eye more often with this wand (maybe because it doesn't have long bristles, so I feel like I have to get closer?), and it hurts worse because it's not really bristles but actual pointy plastic pieces. The short bristles also make me get it on my eyelid behind the lashes more often, so I have to do some cleanup afterward. It also makes my eyelashes feel very hard, which I don't like.Even when I don't hit my eye, I can't deal with this mascara mostly because it really bothers my dry, sensitive eyes. It makes them itchy and watery all day. (And for some reason I always seem to forget this and still buy it on a whim occasionally - need to remember not to buy it again!).My preferred mascara is Cover Girl Professional, followed by Maybelline Full-n-soft. I really hate the Define-A-Lash."
4346,1,Works Great!_I love this deep waver. It's the first one I have purchased and it really gives me beautiful waves. I recommend hair spray or mouse (preferably with heat protection)so the waves remain in place for a longer period. Also don't leave this on a surface that can burn while it's on. I left it on my bed and it burned it.
5531,1,"LOVE!_Love!!! Leaves my face so smooth and soft. Although it's an oil, it doesn't make my face break out. I like it even better than the Bare Minerals Overnight Serum."
8765,1,"Motions Straight Finish Cleanser_I have several of the Motions products and like them.  I thought this product would also work on non-African type hair but it didn't really do well.  I have typical straight Caucasian hair and washed my hair with this product.  It lathered up nicely but I noticed it didn't rinse out very well but I tried blow-drying it anyway.  It left a heavy film on my hair and I had to re-wash it to get it out.I'm not upset at all though because I can see how this product would be good for African hair, or for non-African hair that has been damaged by perms, sun damage, etc...  It barely had a scent at all and I really liked that as well.  I will continue to use this product, but I will have to follow it up with another shampoo to get the heaviness out."
5100,1,Essential part_I have been using obagi for many years now.  It was recommend it by my dermatologist.  It helped me get rid of sun damage and other imperfections on my skin.  Toner is an essential part of the system. I highly recommend obagi
3073,1,"LOVE IT!! YES ITS DUAL VOLTAGE_just got my hsi flat iron today! came in a cute red pouch with small bottle of this hsi oil thingy a heat protected glove, the flat iron gets hot quickly it straightens great its DUAL VOLTAGE!!!!! LOVE THAT it curls beautifully i curled my hair real quickly to see how it would turn out it was beautiful very nice hard curls!"
1110,1,"Nice stuff, but more like a body cream than body butter_The body butter has a nice 'organic' scent, consisting of some green notes accented by just a hint of floral in the background. I noted that it contains jasmine and cucumber, so that would definitely explain the freshness of this scent. While some men might be scared off by anything with jasmine in it, I wouldn't classify it as a floral scent at all and could easily be considered unisex. I absolutely love it - it's not cloying at all.Although this product is rich in moisturizers, the consistency was not quite what I expected. I have used a lot of body butters and my favorites are always super thick, just like butter! Hempz body butter is more like a rich body cream, with a lighter whipped feeling. It's softer to the touch and is not nearly as dense as say, The Body Shop Body Butters. Nonetheless, it is a great moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and leaves the skin feeling soft and silky, with a nice dewy glow to it. This body butter also has very good long term moisturizing capabilities, keeping my skin feeling moisturized all day. I also noticed that it's very good at repairing dry, cracked skin on my feet.The scent is not as long lasting as some of my favorite body butters and doesn't seem as intense once I apply it. I don't really care in this case as I normally use fragrance anyhow. But I do know some women prefer strongly scented body moisturizers in lieu of perfume, so this probably wouldn't work for them."
7802,1,"Perfect eye pencil for me_I don't want to have to spend forever on my brows. The unusual angle of the pencil is perfect for quickly filling and shaping brows. I purchased #3 Gray-black which I was scared may be too dark, but it's actually perfect. It pretty much blends seamlessly into my brows. For reference, I have black hair. A pure black pencil would have made me look severe and a lighter brown tends to look too reddish on my face."
2865,0,"Sorry Burt_This Burt's Bees Men's Body Wash was an unfortunate purchase. It lacks all the things one would want or expect from a higher priced natural product. It has a runny consistency, it doesn't lather well, it doesn't clean well, and the scent is odd and unappealing.When pouring the product, it is runny about like maple syrup. It is therefore difficult to manage in the shower. It doesn't spread over the body, but rather stays in one place near where you apply it, which means you have to use more. I suppose both of these problems (runny, doesn't spread) could be mitigated by using the product on a sponge or scrub.Then I discovered it doesn't clean well. My simple commonsense test of the cleaning ability of a body wash is: Can it clean my armpits? Armpits are (in my case anyway) hairy, and they accumulate sweat and deodorant/antiperspirant, and I can see and smell my own armpits to judge performance. This product did not remove all deodorant and smell even after 2 applications and scrubbing.Finally, the smell is odd and disagreeable. The strangest thing about the fragrance is that it doesn't come together in your nose. It's like a slide show of odors - first you smell citrus, then you smell pungent, pine-ish (or is that Pine-Sol?) and then a bit of something sweet. My final impressions of the scent are 'medicinal' and 'household cleaning product.'Props to Burt's Bees' customer service though: I thought maybe I had a bad bottle, so I wrote Burt's Bees and asked them if I got a dud. Their generous response was to send me another bottle of the body wash in the mail. Now I have 2 bottles of disagreeable men's body wash (sorry Burt).There are several products out there that I would recommend over this, even some that I don't like all that much (Neutrogena Rainbath, Everyman Jack, Desert Essence castile). So if you are still wondering about this product, before springing for a 3-pack of disappointment, try to find a bottle of it in a retail store and take a good look at it."
5724,1,Good_Not over drying. Feels gentle on the skin and still left with a fresh and clean feeling. Like the exfoliating particles

6618,0,I developed an eye condition after using this!! Don't use!!_I bought this concealer and I was very happy to see how efficiently it conceals under eye circles. The result was pretty amazing but the problem was whenever I used this product I developed eye twitching problem for which I had to go to a eye dr.Very disappointed with some ingredients in this product. I will never recommend it to anyone.
8747,1,"Exceptionally BEAUTIFUL_The Hair CLIP is ABSOLUTELY Beautiful.  I am so TOTALLY PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE I COULD SCREAM.  The HAIR CLIP is a definite HEAD turner. It's sturdy, well built and SO worthy of the price. I am about to place another Order for a friends and family member."
6009,1,"Seriously surprised_For the price, i really didn't expect much. And i also thought i'd probably just use the black. But i was really surprised at the fun i had with some of the brighter colors. I rarely wear eyeliner, but these were still pretty easy to apply. You can just put a little for a subtle sparkle, or layer for something more dramatic. Today i used the black and layered with the teal and green to match my outfit. Even just to work it didn't seem like too much. And hours later it's still visible. I can't wait to try the other colors. I've found they work better if you first line with a regular eye liner first. It gives the glitter something to stick to and the colors pop a lot more."
4169,1,Okay so far._I got this cause I have really weak nails that like to chip and tear for no reason at all.  It hasn't totally handled the situation but I'm still using it to see if it improves any further.  My nails break below the top of the nail too often.  I do notice some improved strength to the nails overall but not enough to prevent the breakage.
5124,1,Macdamia Repair Masque_This is one of the finest conditioners I've every used; quite possibly the best! Fair price too considering what's offered out there.
2882,1,Essie good to go Fast dry_This is the best item if you in hurry to get  out and put some on your nails in hurry and dry very fast i love it.
5275,1,"Agadir_As you will see with all of my Agadir reviews, I absolutely love this productline!This would have to be one of the best mousse I've used on my hair, ever. I have fine, then, hair that doesn't take well to a lot of other products. Most other products way my hair down and make it look worse. I Agadir actually makes it look better, healthier, stronger, and shinier.I'm not crazy about the way it smells, like the hairspray, when it first goes on. But I get so many compliments throughout the day that I am overall extremely pleased with the smell!"
518,1,"So far, it's awesome_Ok, so I'll say up front I've only used this iron once.  I'll update in a few months or so when it's gotten more wear and tear.I really, really like this iron.  My hair is long- halfway down my back, curly- and very stubbornly curly.  My normal straightening routine is drying it out most of the way with a blow dryer, then using a fat round brush to get it the rest of the way dry, then touching up with a flatiron.  It normally takes at least an hour and a half, sometimes closer to two hours if a bit is particularly stubborn, not to mention the noisy blow dryer going and eating energy for so long.  And if I do it more than an hour before walking out the door, I need the iron again to touch up.I got the two-inch-wide version, since my hair is so long and I have no intention of cutting it anytime soon.  The digital display is nice- it blinks til it reaches the temperature you set it for, which is a nice obvious indicator (my old iron had no indicator- you just kinda had to guess).  And it does heat up quickly.  Mine got up to the full 420 within a couple minutes.  The cord is a smidge on the short side- another six inches on it would've been nice, but it's definitely functional as it is.I let my hair air-dry yesterday to really test the iron, since letting my hair air dry for a while tends to make it even more stubbornly curly.  It was definitely still wet when I started, a good measure beyond damp, just not dripping wet or anything.  I set the iron to the full 420, let it heat up while I detangled and put straightening cream in my hair (I usually use a Pantene straightening cream that I've used for years and am very happy with).  I clipped up all but a very small section and got to work (and you do need to work in VERY small sections with this iron, I found).The instructions clearly say to point the display and steam vents away from head and hands, which took a little maneuvering around the back of my head, but it wasn't too bad.  The thing definitely had my hair sizzling, but a ton of steam was coming out and nothing smelled like burning, so I figured it was fine.  Some chunks, especially further up my head, needed quite a few passes, but like I said, my hair was pretty wet.  I did burn my head pretty good once trying to get into my roots- it hurt, but no visible damage.  Just be aware the plates on this puppy run around the edges a little bit.  I did notice the plates seemed to cool after running over a wet section, and giving them a couple seconds to heat back up made the next passes more effective.  And 420 is HOT.  Way hot.  It is very easy to burn yourself if you're not conscious of where your hands are, and even on dryer hair as it comes out of the iron.  And I just couldn't get to my roots without burning myself, so when I was done with the iron I took a blow dryer and just hit my roots on a low setting for 2-3 minutes.The results- awesome.  I had pin-straight hair when I was done, no touch-ups necessary.  I think because this iron gets so hot, once the hair dries and you're going over dryer sections, it really seals in the straight better.  I went back up to check it a couple hours later before we left the house, after lying around on the couch on it, and still no touch up needed- it was still stick straight.  We went out for dinner on a rainy, wet night, and yes I wore a hat outdoors, but mine is hair that curls at the mere suggestion of moisture, and when we got home, hair was still perfectly straight.  Went to bed, humidifier on, woke up this morning, and all I need are a few minor touch ups at the very ends, which is hugely different from what I normally experience on waking up the day after.  And it feels soft and looks shiny and healthy.As for time- it didn't quite cut styling time in half or anything- the total probably took 45 minutes to an hour.  But it did give me some freedom- I can now shower when I want to, and as long as my hair doesn't dry completely (3-4 hours) before I get to straighten it, I can still straighten with good results.  Before, if I let it air dry at all, forget it- my hair was not going to be perfectly straight, and to get it acceptably straight would be a couple hour chore.  I did have to follow up with some cream after straightening- I guess it just got a little too dry- but I have to do that sometimes with the blow dryer anyway, so no big deal there.This iron simply is awesome, especially when you factor in the price.  It's not going to take your styling time from two hours to ten minutes or anything, but that's simply not realistic.  If this lasts a year, I'll be more than happy to shell out for a new one at that time, considering how difficult my hair is.  And it does prevent sweating your brains out under a noisy blow dryer for an hour and change- the quiet and lack of sweat alone is worth it.  I was very on the fence about this iron when I bought it, but after one use, to get it away from me will mean prying it out of my cold, dead hands- I'll never go back to my blow dryer and fat round brush!Edit: So a year and a half later, my straightener is still going strong.  It still heats up good and hot, and does the job without the bother of a noisy hair drier (which my husband loves; he can nap right up until the last minute without waking up to my straightening my hair).  I do tend to develop a little cloud of steam and sometimes slightly singed hair smell when I use it, but nothing the ceiling fan can't handle. I don't prefer to straighten my hair in the summertime because of the heat and sweat, but I've straightened it for evens with this iron a couple times with good results.  I'm still incredibly happy with it and can't believe it's lasted this long, and I'm nowhere near needing a replacement."
3255,1,"Makes my hair feel pretty good!_I love coconut oil in my hair - that being said, this product is great. I run through jars of regular coconut oil pretty often and it gets a bit messy digging in the jar. It is typically pretty cold in my house so I did have a problem with the oil solidifying but I know that coconut oil tends to solidify so this didn't really bother me - a quick run in some warm water helped a lot."
4099,1,"Plum lipstick review_I am not a lipstick person, but I LOVE this lipstick. I bought Plum. I am almost 30 female. I have been doing mostly neutral lip glosses for most my adult life. I am half Asian and have tried to stay away from darker lipsticks because my mouth is fuller and rosebud shaped. I usually accent my eyes with liner and mascara with a neutral gloss, but wanted to try changing my look a little bit with a darker lipstick.This lipstick is moisturizing and stays put. The plum on my lips does look very much like the color of the Asian girl in the photo. Every lipstick looks different on a Person because of our different natural lip colors. I highly recommend you try the plum, I think it would compliment every woman. If you wanted it glossier you can apply a gloss on top. For lip color with gloss, go with a more expensive Chanel lipgloss brand. It is the only department store makeup item I splurge on. It will last you a very long time, too.If you want to experiment with a lipstick that is very inexpensive but looks expensive on, try the plum. I was going to go with a more neutral shade, but I already have neutral shake glosses. If you want something different and special in your makeup bag, try it. I am sure the neutral shade lipsticks in this brand are excellent, too though for everyday use. I wasn't sure how it would be buying lipstick on amazon. I usually buy vitamins and face cream (vanicream and cetaphil face wash, they are the BEST), and maybe some random gifts etc. I wanted to write a review to help someone else who is also picky in what they buy, in case you're on the fence about buying this lipstick. I give 5 stars for an excellent product and speedy delivery.Hope this review helps you:)"
5840,1,"like!_I was very cheap, stays in well and I have no problems with it. If you are blonde, you might want to get the lighter one it might show through."
7518,1,A must for every gel manicure--the best base and top coat around!_Gelish base and top coat go on easily.  Apply in thin layers so not to have overpaint on your cuticles.  Overpaint will result in polish that does not last on the nail.  The Gelish brand is easy to apply and lasts and lasts when properly applied!
8840,0,They look smaller in the picture >:(_I love to do nails and found these studs to be trending so i decided to purchase them ....they are to big for my nails!!!!!They defiantly look smaller in the picture and they fall off a lot. Other than that the colors are really nice.
2854,1,"One clip can hold any amount of hair._These are also know as alligator or T-Rex (looks like dinosaur teeth) clips.  I am Latina, so I have thick naturally curly hair and the basic claw clip does not hold my hair in place.  I am able to pile my hair on top of my head with one clip and it will not slip or budge until I remove it.  They are perfect to use when sectioning your hair to color or flat iron.  Easy to use and will not pull your hair out.  Since they have such a powerful hold, I would bet they would work great with thin hair as well."
8187,1,"Actually seems to be working, but irritates my eyes_At first I was very skeptical of this cream.  I've tried everything under the sun (except surgery) to get rid of my cellulite with no success.  Over the years I've tried countless creams, body wraps, spa treatments, and exercise, but nothing seems to help.But to my surprise and utter delight, this Skinny Cream actually seems to be working!!!  I didn't notice any changes for the first two weeks, but after that I began to see subtle improvements.  All my cellulite is concentrated on my upper thighs, with the right leg being the worse.  I have one dimple that is so huge you could practically park a car in it.  But after a few weeks of using this cream the largest dimples don&#8217;t appear as deep and overall my thighs don&#8217;t look as rippled.  I&#8216;m going to continue with the cream and hope that more of the dimples will fade away before summer season starts.The only down side to the cream is that it irritates my eyes.  But if the cream gets rid of my cellulite I can live with watery eyes."
4631,1,"An Acne weapon_Helped clear acne i began to experience after returning to college, dries out my face a bit but i fix that with a night and day moisturizer or alternate uses with another face wash, over all i claim this to be my secret weapon, no more acne and even marks  have faded, this is the one thing i will be sure i NEVER run out of :)"
598,1,"Wonderful product!_I bought these on a whim because I wanted to be healthier...well, you know the bloated fat feeling you get after you eat a lot? With these pills, you don't get that anymore! I think this was a great impulse buy! :)"
2941,1,Love!_I am so excited to order these brushes. I have heard nothing but great things about them and they look fantastic. I love adding new tools to my collection. These are great for beginners and experts a like. Can't wait!
8328,1,"Fun for the kids, no alcohol in it_This is a fun product.  It holds the hair well and doesn't have that strong alcohol smell that is in most adult gels.  Had a blast creating fun designs in the hair."
4758,1,Great C_This is a really great concealer and very light weight.  It is the only concealer that I have found that can match my complexion and undertones.
6406,1,"Amazing Brush!_I love my Sigma Brushes, I have had no problems with shedding, etc. I first purchased the Tapered Highlighter and it worked exactly as I'd hoped it would. Then I purchased this one mostly for powders & blushes. The shape allows you to go right under the eyes, around the hair line & nose. Very easy to wash with a good brush cleanser, I recommend Sigma's Dry N Shape, keeps your brushes in amazing condition & quickly dries them in perfect shape. This brush is also nice for contouring & highlighting as well. This one is a must have in your brush arsenal! One thing for Sigma...PLEASE make a good Fan Brush available for single sale! I can only find the one in an expensive kit and would love one similar to the MAC 187!!"
45,1,hg_HG face moisturizer. its the only kind i can use that wont break me out with repeated use. wish the spf were higher. i only use the classic formula with zinc.
7393,1,"Best sunless tanner_I love this tanner. It gives you instant bronze glow, smells great, and this price on Amazon is way cheaper than my local store. It lasts long, and there is so spotting or streaking. I have tried every product under the sun, and this is hands down the best. I recommend this to all my friends."
3825,1,Buy this palette! What are you waiting for!!_Awesome! Love love love! It's worth the money I promise you !  Great quality and great coverage ! You won't be disappointed. !
3525,1,"Best skin polish ever!_This is the only thing that will get rid of those annoying little bumps on my elbows.  Lotion doesn't help, nor does a loofah, but the Clarisonic Refining Skin Polish used with my Clarisonic does the trick!  This stuff also keeps the rest of my skin smooth, soft and glowing.  One of the great things is that I don't even have to use a lot of it, I just squeeze a small circle of it onto my already wet Clarisonic brush and polish away.  Cheap this product is not, but it is well worth every penny."
4024,1,"peel_This really works.  You have to be careful because it will burn. There is a pretty strong burning sensation.  I can tell a real difference in my skin.  It is much m ore effective than more dilute strengths, but one should work up to it. I will definitely continue to use this product."
2131,0,Not Insured._I ought to get my insurance money since my eye makeup melted off my face!I guess my eyelids are still too oily that this product won't save my eye shadow.  Wicked bummer. I don't think this product does anything for my eyes other than making it a light beige and tint my eyelashes that color too (it's unpleasant). 2 stars because I like the company's ethics.I guess I'll go try out Urban Decay's Primer Potion!
4877,1,"ldh_Fantastic!  Very natural looking and such good quality for its price.  Also, these eyelashes can be used more than once, or twice!  Will buy more once I'm done with the package."
3421,1,"A little like getting ketchup out of a glass bottle_I bought this brand for a few reasons, mostly because Sally was out of my usual product Speed Demon by Nail Life because it was on sale and whenever they run a sale it just flies off the shelf because people like me buy like 3 bottles, and Seche Vite was also on sale but available and my stamp blogger friends recommended this for stamping. I bought a bottle because it was an emergency, I needed some top coat to give as a gift and I only had one bottle of speed demon on hand I always like to keep some on stock base and top coat is an essential item to me and when I see a sale or a bulk size bottle or a great price I stock up, so I gave the stuff on hand away because it was a 1 oz bottle and I thought the recipient would like a bigger bottle better than the .5 oz seche, and tried this, I gotta say it totally became my favorite top coat, but the price was really high, even on sale over $5 a bottle so I still considered buying the other one when I could because its cheap, I accidentally came across this while searching for something else and I figured I'll buy it from amazon with my gift card, I found out it was MUCH cheaper here even with shipping it was around $5 different, and the other site didn't even include shipping in that price! I filled a bottle for my friend I figured its only like $2 to fill her up a .5 oz bottle so I gave her one plus I wanted to see how it poured so I took an empty OPI top coat bottle (I clean out my old bottles when they run out so I can mix my own colors) the funnel top is useless its like the dumb glass ketchup bottles in restaurants people put there butter knife in to get it to pour, I even cut the end and it barely drips out so I just carefully poured it without the special tip, no problems at all. I am guessing its because the refill bottle is made of glass. I think the packaging could be a little different, but overall I will still give it 5 stars because its a great product for an amazing value!"
9982,1,"Amazing for skin issues, skin health & anti againg_Why I love this hyaluronic acid serum: Right away one of the key things I noticed about this serum is it (& the vitamin c serum) had a totally new ingredient to me in them, gotu kola extract. So I started researching this new to me extract & learned some great things & so I became excited to be trying both the vitamin c serum & the hyaluronic acid serum from Amani Pure. What makes gotu kola extract so amazing? Well it is used to treat wounds, skin issues such as acne, pimples, blackheads,  eczema & psoriasis, inflammation, & even claims of it helping skin caner (research it yourself). So adding this great extract to the hyaluronic acid serum (& the vitamin C serum) was a no brainier for skin care, anti aging & even for this product being amazing for skin issues while being gentile. I love that.OK yes so I have used so many natural skin serums,so as I normally do the very second a skin care serum arrives I took the lid off, added the pumper & pumped out enough to rub it between my fingers to see how it felt, smelled & reacted with my skin, from there I applied it to the back of my right hand (I applied theAmani Pure - Our Best Vitamin C Serum 20% For Face - Vitamin C combined with Hyaluronic Acid + Jojoba Oil + Gotu Kola Extract + Vitamin E & Other Skin Perfecting Agents - Best Natural & Organic Ingredients - Use with Derma Roller - BONUS: Comes with a N...to the back of my left because it arrived at the same time). Only pump out a small amount at a time because a little goes a long way, it glides on smooth as the skin literally sucks in as it hydrates & leaves no residue behind, as a matter of fact what is left behind is hydrated healthy looking & feeling skin (try it on your feet, trust me).After several days of using it on my right hand & the vitamin C serum on my left hand I switched to using them both on my face, first the vitamin c serum then the hyaluronic acid allowing time for them to absorb in before using the next one & allowing time before adding a bit raw coconut oil to my face for moisturizer. I have to say I love the Amani Pure Serums, they might well be in my top 3 favorites & that says a lot as many brands as I have tried. It is also always a plus for me when these natural serums include a pump top, yea it does not make it more high quality & it is not a needed plus for the product to work better but a pumper for these products is so nice & convenient so I always give props when they add a pumper over a dropper.Using this hyaluronic acid made my skin look so healthy & radiant as well as I noticed far less breakouts & & I tend to get a dry flaky skin issues around my nose during the summer & it cleared up with no sign of irritation. This serum is a clear gel like hyaluronic acid with a very mild natural scent."
1393,1,"Great stuff!!!!_I found out about this product on the Tyra Banks show.  She had several guests of different body sizes use this product for a month and the results were pretty amazing.I am in my early 40's and fairly slim but my skin is not nearly as firm as it once was and I have always had cellulite. I have been using this (and the Good-bye Cellulite patches) for over a week now and am thrilled.  My skin's firmness has returned to what it was in my 20's.  I can already see a difference in my cellulite.  I do not expect that this product will completely eliminate every ripple and dimple but I can see that it is resulting in a massive improvement.I have used countless anti-cellulite products, many of which were very costly and none produced results significant enough to talk about.  This is the only product that I have used that I think warrants any type of recommendation and this one gets two thumbs up!  So, rather than using boutique, designer or department store brands save yourself some money and aggravation and try this version!"
7904,1,love it_I use them so much and my frineds love it too thinking about buying more thank you so much !!!
7836,1,This is a easy to wear wig._This is an easy to wear wig with really smooth to touch.  It is great for waering out on an evening date.  I think anyone who gets this wig will be really happy they did.
2093,1,CND Scrub Fresh Nail Surface Cleanser_This works good. I put on my base coat and nail polish and top coat a week ago and it's still on. :0)This is a wonderful thing.
9034,1,"Nice styling product_This is my second purchase of this product, and both experiences are awesome.Pros-heats very fast-outside does not get hot to the touch-plates do not lose the coating, like some cheaper straighteners-nice carrying pouch and glove included in the packageConsThere is no digital display-the temprature only goes up to 410*-the temprature dial can easily be bumped and you have to readjust the tempI have a fine straight hair and I also bought the straightener for my mom who has this I coarse hair and it works wonderfully on both hair types."
6381,1,"Good_Great tasting, just stared drinking it and noticed I have a bit more normal energy and my pains are minimal in the day time.  Still too soon to say if it's actually working."
7668,0,"DO NOT BUY!_If I could give this zero stars, I would.  These shipped so slow I actually was confused about what it was in the mail when it came for me.  They shipped me about 3 or 4 shower caps, not 40 like I ordered and they are completely small and flimsy and all shriveled up.  I am so disappointed with this purchase.  DO NOT BUY THESE! Walgreens carry a brand call &#34;Donna&#34; clear shower caps that are actually pretty good.  I wish I had known this before I ordered these."
756,1,Really nice product_I bought this after I got tired of the stench of an otherwise-okay Alpha Hydrox night cream. Oh What a Night does everything a night cream is supposed to do - moisturize overnight without leaving a greasy residue on my pillow. And it smells nice in a unique kind of way. I'll keep buying this (small jar) - it's hard to believe I'll find something better for the price.
7261,0,"Nice scent and color, but bad for my acne._I loved the lemony-scent of this stuff, but was ultimately disappointed.I found that it triggered acne-breakouts for me, and also had a tendency to uh, collect in the creases above my eyes."
6979,0,"Terrible Stuff._After about a week of using it I started getting small breakouts all over my face and especially on my forehead.Adding this cleanser was the only change in my routine, and my acne went away shortly after not using it anymore.It brought on the acne but did not do a thing for the blackheads.The only redeeming quality is the warming effect it has, and even then is lasts only 5 seconds at the max.Just don't buy it."
7548,1,"So far, so good_This cream does what I had hoped it would, it warms up really good during workouts. I don't have cellulite really, but I like buying the lotions and creams for prevention, tightness and smoothness. This cream seems to allow you to bring blood to the surface which means increased circulation."
4220,1,"Very good products_I find most shampoos and conditioners make my scalp itch, Pureology doesn't. All my other shampoos are sulfate free, but still cause a problem. I don't have dandruff, just itchy scalp."
7606,0,"WHAT IS THIS CRAP!!!!!!_ITS NOTHING BUT GRIT....ITS FEELS HORRIBLE, I BLENDED IT, MELTED IT DOWN AND WHISK IT AND ITS STILL FEEL THE SAME LIKE GRIT. I THREW THE STUFF AWAY. I CNT BELIEVE IT. SHEA BUTTER SUPPOSE TO FEEL LIKE THAT, I TRIED TO WORK WITH IT BUT I JUST COULDNT GET IT TO WORK. I AM SO SORRY THAT I DIDNT STICK TO OTHER SHEA BUTTER I ORDER PRIOR, BUT THIS ONE IS HORRIBLE. MY ONIPION IT DIDNT WORK FOR ME..."
6395,1,LOVE SIGMA BRUSHES!!_I am using my husbands account. I love sigma brushes and I would recommend them to anyone. I have several!! I like them better then mac brushes.
8290,0,"left a lot of residue after a few weeks_I am writing this review in conjunction with a review I am writing for the conditioner, as I assume the end result is due to the use of both products.This is actually an edit of my earlier review, in which I gave this product 4 stars. My hair looked great the first time I used it, but after a few weeks it was starting to feel a little grimy, like I wasn't able to wash the shampoo completely out of my hair (and I take long showers and rinse for a long time), so I started going back to my old shampoo a few times a week in order to take a break from the Suave and clean off the residue.Today my husband actually asked me if I had washed my hair recently, or if I had put gel in it or something. When I ran my fingers through my hair I was shocked - I realized how stringy and greasy it felt and then checked in the mirror, and it looked awful, like I hadn't washed it in days! (I had actually just washed my hair that morning.)I think this Moroccan oil that they put in the shampoo and conditioner is just too heavy. After several weeks of continuous use it just left a lot of residue that wasn't washing off. (And just fyi my hair is a little past shoulder length, straight and somewhat fine). Maybe this is good for coarser or thicker hair - I don't know - but it's way too heavy for mine."
7330,0,"It's a ONE!_Well, I don't know what all the rave is about this product line, but I rate it a ONE!  I bought the dark blue &#34;10&#34; bottle at full price and the product just weighed down my hair.  I was lucky enough to be able to return it for a full refund.  I then came across the light version at a clearance price at my local grocery store for $6.  Although it didn't weigh my hair down as much, It did nothing for me hair.  Try ISO Bouncy Cream.  It will make your hair so soft and manageable.  Just my two &#34;beauty&#34; cents."
911,1,"LOVE THIS REALLY IS EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!_I really, really love this product!I have tried it only once so far & noticed a difference in my skin straight away! it helped to relieve my dry skin and a few small pimples on my face and neck! I would strongly recommend this product! I love the Queen Helene products as it is and I own quite a few of them! This mask is really Excellent for a mud mask and smelt nice and dried nicely too! My skin felt so soft after only using this mask once! I will implement it into my routine!!I have tried alot of products and so far this is my favorite mud mask!!If you need additional information post a comment and i will get back to you as soon as possible!!"
2127,0,Not very absorbent_This item was a disappointment.  The colors I received were hideous.  The towels themselves were not absorbent at all.  These will be used as garage rags.  Don't waste your money.
5044,1,Does what it says._I really do like this product. The shampoo I was using before was absolutely terrible and gave me the worst dry scalp I ever had along with a ton of flakes! I immediately wanted a new shampoo that would sooth and heal my scalp. I bought two bottles of this shampoo a few months ago and it instantly helped. It's great to say that my scalp is doing phenomenal to this day and has absolutely no flakes. The smell isn't anything special but it isn't strong either so usually the smell of my conditioner takes over and my hair smells nice.
3181,1,The Best Gel Period!_I love this gel!! Works great on my hair and it's the only gel I will use. It doesn't leave white residue in my hair and It just makes my hair look neat and controlled. High Recommend!!
8872,1,"You've Come a Long Way Baby!_Wow, electric rollers have come a LONG way in the last 30 years! I'm thrilled with how fast these heat up, as well as the easier fastening. Electric rollers USED to take a minimum of 20 minutes to heat up, and the only thing that kept them in your hair were metal clips that tended to dig into one's scalp. These clips are a vast improvement over the old style. The just open rather like a chip clip and clip right over the roller. This one is a winner with me!"
2789,1,Taming_This product is perfect for taming my unruly hair. It is smooth and not much needed to do the trick !
1431,1,"Very good soap_If you can get past the name of the soap, it is a very good soap for dull complexion. It is more drying than I need, but moisturizing after use helps. It does leave you clean and after using it, you squeak when you walk. It is true to advertisement."
7623,1,"beautiful blue_great color. full coverage 2 layers, applied great. there is a little shimmer on bottle that does not show up on hand at all"
5625,1,Refreshing_I LOVE these.  They smell great and they don't irritate my skin the way the grapefruit ones did.  My skin feels soft and refreshed without any stickiness.  I use these after removing my makeup to make sure that my skin is completely clean.  I also love using them at the gym after working out to refreshing up.  Will definitely buy these again.
4,1,"Gives the appearance of thicker hair._I have changed an earlier review on this product. My fault, I was a newbie to the reviewer world and I failed to realize the importance of tried and true testing. 160 reviews later I get it. It took 3 different products and a very specific combination of products to achieve the texture that I was looking for.Me - 28 this month. V shaped hairline. Hairstyle - long enough to run a comb through, usually let it grow for 1.5 months then cut back.The Biotin B-Complex conditioner is a daily counterbalance to the Biotin Shampoo. The Shampoo is harsh but effective. It leaves my hair feeling like a brillo pad and the conditioner helps break that apart. When used together the signs of balding are significantly reduced (seeing your scalp through the hair). Also, my hairstyle is a lot easier and fuller looking (messy and pushed up in the front).Even with the combination I found my hair needing a break from the two. I use Organix Coconut milk conditioner once a week to soften my hair. This is an extremely effective break.The proportions I use suit my taste. The appearance of thickness is all I really care about. I know i'll go bald eventually which is why i'm putting the work in the gym now. You have to be in shape if you're bald :)"
9352,1,"A perfect anti aging serum!_This serum is liquid like water but applying is a snap- I just take some product out with the applicator- drop it into my palms and then quickly apply it on my face and neck (BTW: I also put it on the backside of my hands). It dries in under 1 minute and has no feel whatsover to it- not greasy not oily or sticky- just like water. You can just follow up with any moisturizer, primer or foundation or whatever you regularly do and you will not feel any difference. But the serum will do it's magic! I am very pleased with this product. I am a true Vitamin C Serum believer and that this product also includes Vitamin E AND Hyaluronic Acid makes this product a top pick when choosing a serum! I got this product as part of an advertorial."
6043,1,Awesome_Exactly what I wanted and what I had ordered. my daughter and her friends just love girls night at sleepovers.
434,1,"Fantastic product, I've used it for years_I receive many compliments on my skin/complexion. I used to get breakouts all the time, but since I dropped using the alcohol-based SeaBreeze and started using a tea tree oil based cleanser, my skin cleared up and pretty much stays that way 24/7! I can't recommend this product highly enough. It works great for adults, and probably for teens as well (although I didn't start using this until I was in my thirties). I normally buy it from my local grocery coop store, but I wanted to leave a review for Amazon shoppers, so they will know this is a great product to take a chance on, even if you can't find it locally. Go ahead and order some!"
8542,1,"Seems Decent_I'm not sure about its claims to repair damage or protect against future damage, but it does seem to work well in terms of conditioning. I used the recommended 5-day 'treatment' and my hair does seems a little bit softer (a tiny bit more so than with my regular conditioner). Your mileage may vary, but for me it's a decent product. Recommended."
7351,1,:)_i haven't used this yet but it seems like it'll be very useful or at least i hope it will.
5499,1,"Nifty Hair Dryer That Delivers on its Promises_I found the Infinitipro to be an extremely versatile hair dryer that was easy to use and especially easy to store due to the ability of the drier to fold at the handle. All the standard temp settings are there and the light and compact feel of the drier really makes it a great buy. If you're looking for something compact and lightweight, and you don't mind the metallic green color, this is the hair drier for you."
7075,1,"Works well_Works well.  My mom had one of these years ago.  Hers was a little smaller, which i would prefer, but otherwise a good product."
6832,1,Organix is the best of the best of the best_Nothing else to day - Best products for hair - I tried the moroccan oil (shampoo and conditioner) first and I was in love - then I continued with the rest of the different products and I cannot be happier - not even the very expensive treatments like Kerastasse or Tigi are working as good as Organix does with my hair - and for half the price or more
7103,1,"So surprised..._I was upset because my hairline was receding and overall thinning, but since I started using this product, I have very fine hair growing at the hairline.  I don't use after every shampoo because it does have a bit of a stiffening quality and sometimes I just want my hair to feel flowing.Bottom line, it's working!"
2682,1,Works great_I like this stuff. It works great. Moisturizes well and helps hide the natural red in my face.  SPF seems to work well too.
5462,1,"AMAZED!_I have to totally disagree with the person who said the picture is deceiving and the bag is too small. I was so surprised when it was delivered. It is big enough to hold ALL of my makeup and ALL of my brushes and that's not an easy thing to do. I have 5 of the big brushes, you know like the ones you apply foundation, mineral veil, blush, Luminizer, etc. It has slots big enough for all of them. And I am a Bareminerals collector. I have it all and it all fits in this bag. I am so glad I did not read that review until after I had ordered the bag. Get it, you won't regret it."
5261,1,"Turkey Neck?  Not me._I started taking Life Extension's Phytoceramides in November to try to improve the texture of my neck skin.  I'm in my 50s and am mistaken for being in my late 30s to early 40s, but my neck was starting to show my age.  I knew I had to do something.  I first noticed an improvement in the tone and texture of my neck after three weeks.  By the fifth week, I'd estimate there was about a 25% improvement.  Currently, it appears there's about a 50% improvement.  I'm happy."
5255,1,"Natural Mascara_I was pleasantly surprised that I really like this product.  I ordered it just to see how bad a natural, organic mascara really could be.  I couldn't imagine that I would actually like it, but because I am a label reader and try very hard to purchase as pure products as possible, I decided to give it a try--and voila!  I like it.  Now, don't get all excited and think that your lashes are going to look thick and dark and beautiful.  I will just say that it covers the lashes well and makes your lashes show up!  And I have not noticed any flaking, or smearing.  So for all that, I gave it five stars, because what else can a natural gal expect of her mascara?"
1867,1,"Good for the Price_Maybe they are not premium, but still they are value for money and worth the price. I think I like them, yeah."
7699,1,"Love it!_Grate plates, beautiful designs, work nice, this set made me soooooo happy, it have a lot of designs to try and experiment"
1623,1,"Best curling iron I've ever owned_I bought this on the recommendation of a friend.I have really fine blond hair that doesn't respond well to being tamed.  It won't be straightened and when I try to curl it, it falls within an hour.  Somehow this curling iron manages to curl my hair in a way that will stay all day.  The curls last until I wash my hair which is a result I've never been able to manage with any other tool.I will say that it takes a little while to learn - it comes with a glove, but it's too hard to use while wearing the glove, so I've had to get used to using it with my bare hands.  I've had a few good burns both on my hands and neck - it gets really hot.I only use the medium and large barrels - the small barrel winds my hair so small and tight it looks bizarre."
6802,1,"Good Deal_I bought both of these polishes together as a set, the base and top coat, and they work perfectly.  They do everything they should be and the only thing worth noting is that if you are doing your own nails at home, make sure you only use very thin layers of each polish, especially the top coat as it tends to be a little runnier and will run all over the sides of your fingers if you use too much."
1516,1,"good result_I am only going to use this twice a year(don't ruin your face, people). My face looked best 5 days after the peel. I got a slight burn from using a cotton pad, I will use a flat brush with less on the applicator next time."
1879,0,not for me_the gold color...maybe...but the purple is so mate and will not go on my eyelids at all. So annoying trying to use this that I gave up.
6218,1,"very bright_I bought this lipstick because I saw a review about it on youtube. Well after getting it I hated it but for some reason I must've got 5 compliments the first time I wore it. I also used a small amount to tone it down a little and then the second time I wore it I added another lipstick on top and must have gotten at least 20 compliments in one day of people asking me what type of lipstick I was wearing. I used this lipstick and added revlon soft nude on top and it gave me an awesome different looking pink, that I love to death. I will definitely buy it again so that I can keep making my new shade."
8400,0,i like these_These were ok. pretty colors but they dont stick good. also i would have loved some type of directions with them.
177,1,"Love_I love Aveeno products. I have very sensitive skin and every new thing i try I am always breaking out in hives, its really hard for me to find a product that works well with my skin, but I've never had an issue with Aveeno, please never change!"
4530,1,Leaves hair very soft_I have used this conditioner for about three weeks now and I can really notice a difference in my hair texture.  It is softer and there are virtually no knots in my hair after using it.  My hair is not as dry as it used to be either.  I would use this again and I would recommend it to others looking for a good conditioner that doesn't break the bank.
6812,1,"Top picks for medium/dark skin tone or pigmented lips_After browsing blogs and looking at a lot of swatches and trying them out for myself(most importantly)!! I think these are the top ten colors you can choose if u hav a med dark complexion or pigmented lips,PINKSPink truffle- very natural your lips but better color!Berry smoothie-  very sheer with shimmerMacaroon- more opaque pink than berry smoothieRaspberry pie- very pigmented berry colorBRIGHTSLollipop - fushia with blue tones, very pigmentedSweet tart- sheer but bright pinkTutti frutti - sheer but bright orange, great way to wear orange/coralsREDSRed velvet- more opaque than the others, deepest red, like red velvet cake!Cherry tart- sheer with shimmerCandy apple- less opaque than red velvet but a brighter red.I hope this list was helpful, if I had to choose a top three I would go with raspberry pie, red velvet and macaroon but I like them all!!! The colors that I haven't mentioned tend to be too light/sheer or cool toned to be flattering on my skin tone. Hope this was helpful!!"
5109,1,"Nice color_I like this color, to me it is a deep red with magenta undertones.I would not call this a hot pink color at all. Maybeon some people's chemistry will show pink, but for me it looked more red than anything. It stays on well also."
6913,1,Easy to apply_This product is easy to apply as it doesn't stay white on your skin until you rub and rub it in.  It also has a nice scent that is not overwhelming.
7068,1,"It's a 10 alright_This stuff is so good for frizzy hair.  I have thick dry hair.  I use a little and rub into ends and my hair just drinks it up. Makes it smooth, not oily.  I would not recommend for thin hair as it may make it oily.  But for thick hair to tame frizzies it's perfect!"
2608,1,"Good Clips_Work well for holding curlers or holding your hair up while styling. Works well on my thick, thick hair :D"
6943,1,"Great Eye Shadow compact!_This is a really nice Eye Shadow compact.  What I like is the back gives yo directions on how to apply.  That really helped me, because I don't wear eye shadow often.  It looks great on, and it last all day."
1900,1,"Great truly cruelty-free fash wash_I have a tendency to use too many harsh products on my face that cause it to dry up and break out. I purchased this because it was all natural, and also because I felt that even though it wasn't an exfoliator (with little beads or granules), the pineapple enzyme still gave me a deep clean that didn't dry out my skin, though I always use moisturizer on my face regardless. Because I do have sensitive skin, I use this at night to remove makeup and any environmental residue (smoke, smog, etc), and then I use something even gentler, like Cetaphil, in the morning. Like some people said, a little bit goes a long way.What I really love about this product is that it is completely and totally cruelty-free. It has a the Leaping Bunny logo on the back of the bottle, which indicates that NONE of their products undergo animal testing during any phase. This means that neither Alba, nor its parent companies, nor any of its suppliers, test on animals. It also means that they do not sell their products in countries that test on animals (such as China). While this might not be a deciding factor for some people, it was for me. It's not always easy to find cruelty-free products (ie: Leaping Bunny certified) in a store like Duane Reade or CVS, so when I came across this and really liked the results, I was very happy that they did not test on animals.I know someone did say that it burned their eyes a little bit and that it had a bad smell. I've personally never experienced either of those and was surprised to hear that. So much so that I went as far as emailing Alba on their site to inform them of this because it seems odd that a bottle would smell great to one person and smell like rubber to another. I always close my eyes when I wash this off my face and honestly do not experience any stinging."
5413,1,The only face wash I will use_This is the only face wash that cleans my skin and doesn't over dry.  It feels so nice and creamy & foamy on my face.
754,1,"Love it._I have 1a/bfii hair ( straight, fine, pony tail 2.5 inches around) It is about 30'  long, just skimming waist length for me. I mixed this with coffee, cinnamon, allspice, and some yogurt to condition my hair. I let is cure for almost 2 hours before putting it on, and left it on my head for about 4 hours, using heat a couple of times. My grays did not get covered at all, but my over all color is great. I posted a photo above of before and after hair. It feels a bit thick and like there's still stuff in it now, so the photo may not give the same idea as to what it will look like when I get to wash it tonight. I think I may henna again in a day or two to deepen the color and get the grays. Next time I will leave it in all night while I sleep. Not sure if I will use this exact shade again or try darker or redder? Hmmm. But, basically, I am satisfied with the product and like it better than other hair dyes I have used in the past. The smell is gross, but grows on you after an hour or two. lol My hair feels full, thick and very soft. It did not damage my hair.*Update.  I did redo it, only this time I used the one with the fox on the box,Light Mountain Natural Hair Color & Conditioner, Red, 4 oz (113 g) (Pack of 3)and like that color better on me. I let those installments cure longer in the bowl, and left them on overnight. My grays are gone! After reading about henna, I have decided to apply it once a month, at least, in an effort to thicken up my hair and make it stronger. I have already ( with 3 applications in 2 days ) noticed many of my hairs going from fine to medium texture. It is smooth, healthy, bouncy and shiny.... best product for my hair, ever.  :)"
8043,1,"Ok..._I have ordered and used this off and on for awhile.  This time when I ordered, the tube seemed to not be completely full and doesn't come out as well as it has in the past.  It does work (when I remember to use it).  I think it is a good product - but you have to keep up with it.  When you stop, so do your eyelashes."
5087,1,A must have_Perfect brush for everything. No hair fallout and maintain it's shape very well! Love this and will buy again in the future!
2585,1,"Favorite_Been using this for a little over a year and I love it. The smell is beautiful (citrus-y orange yum yum) and it doesn't leave you sticky before or after (unless you get a little globbed between your fingers after applying.) It doesn't make you orange at all, it accelerates your tan beautifully just as stated. I use a star sticker on my hip, and I can see a clear outline of where it was when I use this lotion, but I can't see the outline well if I don't. Totally recommend this to anyone looking for a lotion to accelerate their natural tanning color. If you want a deep bronzer this is not for you. Love this lotion, I'll never use anything but Australian Gold! All of their products ROCK!"
1275,1,great_this brush works great on my hair without pulling it and hurting my head. it is a great brush to have
2374,1,one of the greatest hairdryers i have ever had_Amazing hairdryer! I love it and I recommend it to everyone Great price and does a great job! Thank you
6694,1,"Great color_I was looking to add a blue color to my gel nail polish collection and this one filled my need.  It's a great shade of blue, great for summer"
4604,1,Great purchase_Awesome if you want to add a little extra to your nails. Love the variety of colors. Easy to use.
2359,1,"All the great stuff they say is true..._Just wanted to add one more thing:  besides the great smell and consistency, it feels more like a gel than an oil - which means there's no real risk of making your tub slick and falling.  Big plus!"
1523,1,"Very opaque_Good visibility, better than regular white polish.  I don'T know if I am just too slow (I am a beginner stamping) or if it is too old, but I am having trouble getting the image to pick up  and/or transfer before drying.  Will try thinning it if I can't improve with more practice."
5222,1,"OPI You just can't beat it_I love OPI and it's quality and affordability. It lasts and lasts and lasts. I live in the country, do a lot of gardening etc. so my hands take a beating but the nails look great. My advice:  Do wait for drying of all products. You will be rewarded with the wear."
1709,1,nice for price_i wear everday around house it dont stay on long but for price it ok i bought the other names
4391,1,"Grew back my mom's hair beautifully._My mom has type 4b or c or z hair, whatever you want to call it.  If you know the Andre Walker system, you know what I mean.  It is a beautiful hair type but very fragile.  She is 82 years years and last summer, had hardly any hair left in the front--not just the roots but the whole front of her head up to her ears had maybe 1/2  inch or less of hair remaining.  In the back, she had some hair, but it was ragged and all different lengths and felt rough.  She thought she was going to have to wear a TWA forever, like many of her friends her age who have basically jsut given up on ever having hair and shaved it off.  But she did not want to do this.  Though she is an older lady, she is very feminine and does not like her looks with this 'boy' type hairstyle.Anyway, to make a long story short, I sent her a bottle of this Jamaican black castor oil and she started massaging her hair and scalp with it.  I also made sure that she started sleeping on a satin pillowcase and wearing a satin cap, washing with her remaining hair in braids and using Shea moisture shampoo only on her scalp.  I told her to be very low manipulation and she wore a wig to cover up her damaged hair and give it a rest.  I taught her to finger comb only and also to use a little protein on her ends about once a month, after she washed. (Joico K-pak).  Lo and behold!  She lives in Florida and when I returned to visit her, barely 7 months later, her hair had grown so much!  the very short patches had grown a lot, the bald patches had filled in and the back had grown BELOW HER SHOULDERS.  My mother has never had hair below her shoulders in her life (this is difficult for many type 4b people as this hair type cannot take any abuse at all.  It was an unbelievable change.  My mother is so happy.  She continues to use this product as her scalp massage and moisturizer and her hair is not only growing like a weed but feels very fluffly, soft and not greasy at all.  Her goal is to grow her hair enough so that she can wear her natural hair in a bun and not have to wear a wig anymore and it looks like she will make this goal very soon.  We are both very happy.P.S I have type 3c hair which is a lot stronger than my mom's (my dad was mixed-race and I got his hair type).  I have never had balding or breakage problems the way she does,  but I find that this product works well for me, too.  I massage a little on my scalp mixed with some peppermint  essential oil (few drops) and burdock root oil (which I also bought on Amazon.com) every night and I don't have the itching problems I used to have sometimes before.  I think it makes my hair feel a bit softer (I have low porosity hair that tend to be dry) and I like it for me, too."
5017,1,Works Very Well_This makes it so much easier to make a braid ponytail. I know I have a hard time doing it myself without messing everything up and it looking bad but this eliminates it and helps you create a nice neat looking braid ponytail.
8580,0,"Not Great_While the price for these items are great, they are not very effective. Save your money and buy another brand of nail glue."
5067,1,It does its job_This concealer is an oil based concealer in my opinion it's not the best concealer but it does its job. It really does cover up my dark circles but not my blemishes.
3059,1,"Great but kind of pricey_This product is great for my skin type (combination/oily). It doesn't really last all day, though. It probably lasts half a day. After that, I can feel my skin (especially my T-zone) getting greasy. For the time it does work, however, it feels and looks great! I used to try all types of products; tinted moisturizers, SPF moisturizers, moisturizers and foundation, moisturizers and powder, oil absorbers...really...you name it, I've probably tried it at some point. None of them came close to helping my skin.However, since this product only works for half a day, it's on the pricey side for what it's worth.Bottom line: I would recommend this product for people with oily skin."
4664,1,"One of the best moisturizers!_I've been using this for quite a while now & it leaves my skin soooo smooth. It really does make your skin feel refreshed & you will see results right away. I used to have flaky, dry skin but this moisturizer has helped me so much. I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts & haven't had a breakout or anything. My skin loves this stuff. :)A friend recommended this moisturizer to me. I used to use one of the Estee Lauder moisturizers & this one gives me just as great (if not better) results than the expensive ones & you save a ton of money. I definitely recommend this to everyone wanting smooth, healthy skin. :)"
1242,1,"Works great!_This flat iron heats up quickly and works really well according to my wife. She has a CHI and says this one works just as well. As for the Damaged hair repair claim, who knows.. but as a low price straightener, this works well."
6665,1,"Satisfied Customer !_I ordered this item on January 25 and the estimated delivery date was for January 31 so when I checked my mail today I was suprised to to see the package . Their desgin is so unique compared to other dotting tools on amazon and seem to be pretty good quality . Another big plus was the price , I was lucky enough to get them for $2.45 . Can't wait to make pretty nail art with them ."
4093,1,Good cover but kinda orange_I like the feel to this but I have to mix it with something lighter or else it looks dark & orange on my skin. It gives a pretty good coverage too as I have acne scars.
8694,1,"My skin thanks you, Simple Skincare!_I use these wipes specifically on my forehead and nose area, as those are the areas that tend to act a little crazy, oil wise.  These wipes balance out those parts of my skin without leaving it dry, irritated or flaky.  All I feel is soothed, happy skin and it's all thanks to Simple Skincare.  I have quite cranky skin; sensitive to most wipes/cleansers, but I definitely do not have a problem using Simple, they truly know how to help those with sensitive skin!  Thank you to BzzAgent, who allowed me to try these wonderful products free of charge."
4388,1,"Speed up your Blowout!_This is my first tension comb so I didn't really know what to look for or expect.  I think it will be great once I get the hang of using it.  I am getting better after only a few uses, so I don't think it will take long.  It makes my blow out quicker with my long naturally frizzy hair, the part I am still working on is how to use it with my flat iron."
9334,1,"Great conditoning and scent_The Full Blown Volume conditioner does a great job of conditioning and rinses out cleanly so my hair soft and shiny but it doesn&#8217;t leave a build-up to make my hair limp. Because of that I found my styling products work better when I use this conditioner. I also love the love the refreshing citrus, herb and fruit scent. The packaging is great, just the right diameter to easily fit in my hand, has a press to open cap and has a matte finish that isn&#8217;t slippery when wet."
8250,1,"Love it - results were perfect on my 50 year old skin_It refreshed the skin on my face so much that I tried it on my forearms, that have been dry like a desert the last 2 years, and the result was instant and astoundingly wonderful.I have now ordered this as gifts for my sisters. The packaging is gorgeous, modern and says luxury to the eye. A terrific find.There is no scent when applied.Goes on smooth, not oily at all and absorbs 99 percent at once.I don't know if you will find this as interesting but I went to the website and got the list of ingredients:Chronogen(tm) (Highly specialized Tetrapeptide that works with the bodies' natural nighttime repair processes.Glucosamine HCL & Algae Extract & Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract.

7061,1,"My hair is so soft_This shampoo smells great and it leaves my hair so soft.  The container easy stands upside down so you never have to shake it to get the last little bit out of the bottle.  As always, it has no petrochemicals and the container is completely recyclable!"
122,1,"Wonderful_I LOVE this mask.  I have extremely oily, rough and acne prone skin, as well as large pores.  After I've had this mask on, my pores are much much smaller, my blackheads are much much better and my skin is softer.  I also break out less.  Can't beat this price, either!!"
3563,0,eh_I ran out of hand cream at work and randomly picked this product up at the store (obviously not on amazon) and am really disappointed. it is REALLY greasy and doesnt smell very good. my keyboard is shinny and covered in grossness after one use. my hands dont feel like they've been moisturized. I'm really unhappy with the product. not the hand cream for me . . .
3790,0,"Strong fragrance_I received this product through the Vine program, and intended to evaluate it over a period of weeks.  The product description says, 'In 2 weeks: Comfort is restored to skin. After 4 weeks: Skin is firmer and more supple.'I did find that this product did leave my skin feeling soft and hydrated.  However, I find that it is impossible to give this product a full trial, as I cannot abide the fragrance.  People who are sensitive to fragrances should probably avoid this product.L'Oreal Revitalift Triple Power Concentrated Serum Treatment, 1 Fluid Ouncehas a similar fragrance."
6080,1,"Will purchase again_I had a wonderful experience as a regular tanner for about 4 months ... used other products with only oneother product that I was satisfied with.  The other had a tingling additive, which can lead to pain.This product delivers practically everything I was looking for to have to only go tan for once a week. I have a great base tan.and when no sun, with about 10% american native in my traits(this is for reference for considered buyer.I am not really tan without the uv(sun or bed), really pale, but have good tanning qualities.This product has ultimately given me a chance to STAY OUT of the CANCER CAUSING rays.  I love it, Im going to stickwith it.  no splotchiness AT ALL. When first exiting the bed.  I saw 3 shades darker. As a couple of days went by, I would say 10 shades darker.  I stay at this tone for one week and then the tan begins to fade SLOWLY.Love this product and have already recommended to family members."
3056,1,"Good Deal_What I liked the most about this flat iron is that my hair didn't seem to frizz up as much between uses in comparison to my Solia. It doesn't give me the smoothness that I get from the Solia, but my hair was still very soft and healthy looking and stayed that way until I washed it again.I really like the temperature settings (how hot it gets) and how quickly it heats up. The casing did run a little hot, a lot hotter than my Solia, especially towards the tip, but it didn't burn me in any way, so it wasn't a deal breaker.I not crazy about the temperature buttons. I like the nice digital display and the ease of use, but the first time I used this, I didn't know I could lock the keys so I was constantly hitting the buttons and changing the temperature while I was doing my hair. It's not a big deal, especially since it does lock, it was just a little annoying.The thing I don't like about this flat iron was that the side would sometimes leave a print in my hair and I would have to go over that spot again a couple of times to get rid of it. If it wasn't for that and the fact that I get a smoother look with my Solia, I would have given have it 5 stars, minor nuances aside.Overall, I would say that this is a good flat iron and a good buy for those not wanting to pay a hundred dollars more for a more professional grade flat iron."
1894,1,Works pretty good_My teen has severe back acne and is on daily meds for it.  Prior to the meds we were only using this.  It did a decent job.  Only downside we have learned you really need to lather it on and sit with it on skin for several minutes prior to rinsing to get ultimate benefit.  Also you cannot get this in the stores... I wish you could
1859,0,"Not worth the money_This mascara was clumpy and dried out fast, didn't last long.  I didn't get long lush lashes like I do with Buxom."
6367,0,"Gimmicky_I don't know if my spray bottle is defective, but the sealer squirts out like a super soaker instead of a fine mist. It smells horrible and burns my sensitive skin, with the first ingredient being alcohol. I have oily/combination skin and usually get 5 hours maximum wear from the best of foundations. This sealer did absolutely nothing to help my makeup stay longer. Ben Nye, you have disappointed me."
2990,1,GREAT PRODUCT AND GREAT SERVICE!_This is a beautiful shade of lipstick which I can no longer find at my local CVS pharmacy.  It was actually cheaper on line and the seller gave me fast service!
1217,0,No difference noted_I bought this product after seeing a review and recommendation on YouTube but I noticed no effect on my color treated long hair at all. Also the bottle design is HORRIBLE. With wet hands you cannot grasp it firmly enough to spray on your hair because it's tapered at the top. Very poor design. Will not buy again. Buy 'It's a 10' instead.
2395,1,Good but not worth the price_I'm currently in a deployed location and we are literally bathing in chlorine. I purchased this hoping that it would help keep my hair from being damaged so much since I wash my hair nearly every other day. Bottom line it did okay but I was better of just using my Kenra products. However it has done pretty good with slowing the breakage it just didn't leave my hair as moisturized as I would've hoped.
5960,1,not a bad bronze_I still have a little of this left and I swap it out with some of my other favorites. I do not tan often so it is nice to have something with a little bronzer to get my skin browning.
4906,1,Hair Shiny and Silky !!!_This is my first time trying this conditioner and this is one of the best deep conditioner I have ever used! It left my hair shiny and moisturized. It really improved my ends and it deeply penetrated into the hair shaft.
4426,1,"Cleans well and smells great_I'm a guy that keeps his hair short and neat but am starting to thin a bit on top.  My hair is very fine so this seemed like a good product to try.  I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and can say that it does a great job cleaning my hair and giving it a bit more full look then the ragular shampoo I've used for years (some Suave product).  I also had the chance to try and ultra expensive salon shampoo by Paul Mitchell (1 bottle cost close to 6 of the Pantene) and I find little to no difference in the way my hair comes out.  That tells me that there is no need to spend salon prices for shampoo!  I also love the smell of this shampoo.  The first time I used it I was was shocked and almost didn't want to wash it out!  And then later that night while I was reading stories to my 3 year old, he began sniffing my head.  Not realizing what he was doing I said 'what are you doing?' and he repsonded 'your hair smells good'.  Don't think I've ever had anyone say that to me before.  Found that rather funny!"
9382,1,Nice one_Both me and my daughter used this and great for long hair. It was definitely nice and not rough. Bristles were nice and rigid. Overall very nice brush. The grip was good and easy to handhold. Sample provided.
58,1,"Beautiful Color!_As someone who has been dying their hair red for close to ten years, I know a good red dye when I find it. I tend to use this dye in the winter, when a darker red is more appropriate. The color is beyond phenomenal - it's bright, deep, luscious, vibrant, so many positive clich&eacute; hair dye adjectives. It's absolutely gorgeous in natural light. I prefer for my hair color to look as natural as possible, and this is on the very line between natural and unnatural. But considering that most natural-looking don't capture the vibrancy of true red hair, this definitely does the trick.I don't go to any extreme lengths to maintain my color, so with normal washing, the brightness lasts for at least a week. I assume washing in cold water will make the color last longer. Even after it fades, the color is still on the natural side of red. The hair dye itself is perfectly easy to use. The dye and conditioner smell really good, and the weekly conditioning treatment works wonders for dry hair.To put it simply: I strongly recommend this color. The color is true to the box."
3473,0,"Quick ship_I heard a lot of people say this was good but for me it made it look like I had very few, but really long lashes. Not for me. I gave it to my coworker who favs it."
9713,1,looks like a good product_being at certain age now I was researching something to improve the look of my skinwas looking for a decent serum..vit C serum ...now this product caught my eye because of other  extra vitamins in it  A +E ...which I consider as extra bonus ....... I am also a big fan of glass bottles which I was happy to see here  ....and I have already tried it ...so far I like it .....it is actually well absorb  by my skin.....Im hoping it will smoothens it also tightness it ...also it has a wonderful delicate scent like vanilla and oranges and it does not cause any allergic reactions ..Im very sensitive and get red and itchy ASAPWill update with results ...Now ....my  concern is about the value ....I did notice that only few drops will do ...which is great !!!!!but I think that maybe there could be  a bigger bottle available for the price ?....
6691,1,"I'm wearing the polish now!_Great polish.  I bought the Sally Hansen kit but didn't want to spend so much money on their polish.  Some people complain that the polish runs when curing.  Even though the description says you don't need the base coat, you STILL need it.  The base coat gets sticky after curing and therefore allows the polish to adhere to the base coat.  I do a lot of gardening and dish washing and bathing my child.  My nails last for 2 weeks.  I have bought 3 other colors and they all work great.  I plan to buy more...maybe next time I will post a pic!"
3363,1,"MoroccanOil is the best thing!!!_I really enjoy using this oil! It makes my hair soft and silky, yet strong! 90% less split ends! I truly enjoy this oil!"
1840,1,"Perfect!_I love it and use it every day!  Though it is a small tube, it will last a long time.  People have said it has a strong odor but I don't think it does at all.  I didn't order through Amazon but have the exact same stuff and the scent is really light."
307,0,"Scratches scalp_The brush worked very well; however, the tips are so sharp that they created cuts on my scalp.  This is totally unacceptable.  Replaced with Cricket brand which has nice round tips."
5921,1,"life guard for hair_The Redken Extreme Strength Builder plus saved my dead snapping broken dry-damaged hair. My hair has been in a weave for 2 and 1/2 years back to back. Yesterday, i finally take out the weave. My hair was falling out in the comb like crazy. it felt dead and fragile. How depressing. Today, i used the Redken Extreme Strength Builder. My hair did not break! It felt softer, and it was much more manageable than yesterday at the salon.I know it will take a few weeks for my hair to get back to normal. At least now, I'm not afraid to comb my hair, fearing a ton of hair will be in the comb. This product gets 5-stars because it works. I already re-order my second container. I can't live without it."
352,1,"Pretty good concealer_Covers well but still lightweight, dries matte but not cakey. Lasts all day, nice finish. You can layer it if more is needed."
3801,1,"Best Contour Powder EVER!_Awesome contour powder. Very easy to blend, payoff is great. The color is perfect for light-medium skin tones and swatches a grey-brown shade that is precisely what you need for a contour color. Shadows are naturally more of a grey so traditional bronzers aren't the best for contouring in my opinion. The texture is very light, soft, buttery. It's not powdery and there is no fall out. Tap your brush in gently and apply color--no waste. It lasts all day. This is a pricey gem but definitely worth the purchase price. I can see this being a staple in my kit. Will definitely repurchase."
2096,0,"not heavenly_I did not care for this brush. It's just okay. It's not that soft. If you want good brush, go with EcoTools."
4781,1,"dries my hair fast and it is light_makes my hair shinier and it maintains the keratin treatment. it is lighter than the one I had before. it is not small, so that's a disadvantage if you are traveling. but it is powerful. recommend it"
8776,1,"Quality Conditioner in Slippery Tube_Pros+Works well+Smells good, but not overwhelmingCons-Tube isn't designed to be held and squeezed by slippery handsI am once again impressed with Dove's products. I used this in place of my conditioner, and it made my hair more shiny and silky. When used for a few days in a row, the effects intensify. As a disclaimer though, it will do nothing for split ends. Just trim those.The smell is pleasant, and very floral, but not overwhelming, and it doesn't linger for too long, leaving you able to use your perfume without worries. The conditioner is very thick and creamy and it takes a little longer to rub in, but the results are worth the effort and it rinses out quickly.My only complaint is that unlike most other Dove products, this one is tricky to hold and squeeze when in the shower. I certainly would recommend this product, as it does everything it claims."
6329,1,"Amazing!!_I'm surprised this didn't get better reviews..I have very damaged, fairly thick wavy hair. It is so damaged I was forced to cut off about an inch, but the ends were still so dry and brittle. I color my hair frequently (I go through total color changes multiple times a year) so I was excited to try this when a sales rep at my local beauty supply store told me this could help repair my hair. I used a pretty large amount of it, because for some reason I couldn't feel it in my hair. But when I rinsed it and dried it it was amazing. My hair was so soft I couldn't stop running my fingers through my hair. I could easily comb my hair without any tangles. And my hair was so swingy and bouncy. I wish this could be used daily, it's like a great hair day in a little tube! Try it! You have nothing to lose..."
1024,1,"Works pretty good_This blowdryer works pretty good, not the best. I've used better ones, but it does what I need so I'm not going to complain. Could probably get a better one for the price I paid for this."
2194,0,Did not work for me_I did not see any result on my scar. I did use it for a couple months. I do not think I will buy it again.
1297,1,"Great Tingle Lotion!_I have always been a fan of Swedish Beauty tanning lotions, I used to use the Sinful lotion daily for years.  I stopped tanning for a couple of years and then started back when I got my own bed.  I bought this one, hoping it was close to Sinful, since they don't make it anymore.  I have to say it's awesome.  It is a tingle, so if you don't like tingle lotions or you have never tried one, build up to this level before you try it or you will hate it.It offers a nice smell, not a burnt after smell and it's not greasy.  I like that it gives you a bronzer in it as well, and it's not an 'orange' look either.  It didn't take long to build up a tan with this one and I would recommend it to anyone that loves tingle lotions and is a fan of Swedish Beauty lotions."
7367,1,"Love This Color_I really love this shade of blue in the Essie line.  It makes my nails look longer.  Really does remind you of summer, bikinis, and the beach.  Highly recommended."
5101,1,"Perfect eyelashes_I've used many, many different kinds of mascara and have finally hit the jackpot!  The brush separates my eyelashes and I can apply in layers without waiting for it to dry in between applications.  I get no clumping at all.  Makes  my eyelashes appear longer and thicker.  Just love it!"
574,1,"Very impressed_I'm active in several sports, wearing helmets, sweating or the cold of winter, I needed something I could moisture my scalp with but not weigh it down or get my gear full of perfumed smells.  This is amazing!  The side benefit is shiny, fluffed up hair that it noticeable to me and like one reviewer said, scalp itch is reduced.  There's nothing worse then having to scratch you head with a helmet on.  Its expensive but worth it to me.  I didn't buy this to *grow* hair, but condition my scalp and that has shown good results."
4973,1,"No curls here; this does work as a serviceable frizz tamer_I try a variety of products, despite labeling, to find what works for me. I have very straight waist length hair with a frizz problem.Regardless of the name, this product serves nicely as a leave in conditioner to combat the frizz of humidity and graying hair. It is definitely lighter than a lot of the serums I have tried. When I use this as a leave in, I do find I need to reapply it or something else by mid day to keep my hair looking nice.The good news is the very lightness of this product means I do not get that weighted down look that can come with even a drop too much serum style leave-in. I know I am not the targeted user of this product but I do like it quite a bit. I am glad to have it in my arsenal."
7560,1,Great product._This flat iron was exactly what I was looking for. I needed a high heat iron to use with Organix Keratin Treatment and it worked great with a high temperature of 145 degrees.
7304,1,So far so good!_So far I have seen about a 70 percent reduction in dandruff. As far as I am concerned that is working great. It also smells good and it looks great; my hair is shinier for sure. So far this seems like a very solid product.
2431,1,"Konad plate M57_I love this plate, the images are clean and clear and the designs are fun to use. I love using all the Konad products.Thank You"
351,1,"Amazing lotion!_This lotion is the only lotion I could find that had the two ingredients recommended by dermatologists (urea and lactic acid). It seems to really help my skin, particularly when I put it on after a shower. It takes a minute to rub in really well but it is worth it. My skin gets really dry in the winter and this lotion seems to work better than the Vaseline soothing moisture lotion that I had been using."
8116,1,"It Seems To Work_I have been using this product for a few weeks now.  At first, I didn't think it did anything. I then reviewed the instructions and read some of the other reviews to see if I was using it correctly.  With the information gathered, I have been using it on wet, clean hair and immediately blowing it dry and it seems to add volume that stays for a couple days.  It also depends on what products I use to wash and condition my hair.  Some of them, though they make my hair smooth and shiny (protein conditioning), rob my hair of volume that even this spray cannot replace.I have fine hair, though it's not terribly thin, and a layered cut.  I use a curling iron frequently to try to add volume and bounce. This product does seem to work for me without adding any heavy, sticky residual like some other products do.  Awesome!I will continue to use this bottle (there's a lot left!) and update if I have any additional information.  I would encourage you to give it a try at least, when it becomes available.  It's not the most expensive of products and I believe it works.Update- I have one, small frustration with my bottle.  The plunger sticks! It's been doing this for weeks now and I've tried washing it and rinsing it out with no change.  I don't know if it's just my bottle or what, but it's aggravating.  It takes me at least twice as long to spray my hair as I'm constantly fighting the sprayer!  Other than that, I love this as I've continued to use it.  I just hope that the next bottle's sprayer isn't the same."
4680,0,"Trash_Idk why people like this, but personally I don't. I like how cheap it is but the quality is horrible. It's rough so it doesn't flow nicely when you try to straighten your hair. I have to buy another one so basically I wasted money. Don't waste your money, just spend a little more and buy another straightener worth your money."
415,0,"Didn't Work for Me_I tried this spot treatment for four months. I applied this salicylic acid treatment almost nightly to any acne blemishes. It burns pretty bad but, beyond that, I don't think it works. I ran out of this stuff a few weeks ago and my skin looks the same, if not a little better. I should mention that I may be finally adjusting to the ortho-tri-cyclen that I was prescribed to help with my moderate acne but, all I know is my skin didn't seem to improve at all with the use of this product."
1211,1,"So creamy!_I love this soap so much. It's creamy, smooth, and smells great. Coconut has so many benefits for the human body... both inside and out... so I'm glad that I get to rub coconut (and Papaya and Vanilla) all over my skin my the shower! :3It's really great for my dry skin, and I use this on my face too, and it's really helped a lot with my complexion. ^^"
7205,1,"Love it_I love this product, it makes soak offs and acrylic glitter color changes easy. Just a tip add cuticle oil to the acetone and it make it easier on the nail and skin.  I will reorder and reccomend to all.  Great buy.  Love it."
8314,1,"Wonderful value for conditioner - effective for curly hair, pleasing smell, gentle fragrance_The primary user of this conditioner is my daughter who has thick, curly hair.  This is what you'd consider 'value' conditioner - it doesn't cost nearly as much as those salon style conditioners, but despite that, it is thick and effective.  I'm not sure how to describe 'rainforest fresh' - there's lots of things in the rainforest that don't smell very good!  But despite the name, the aroma is sort of floral with a bit of a fruit undertone.  It is fragrant without being overpowering, and maybe the best description is that is smells fresh.  However, the smell is not overpowering like some cheaper conditioners, and while it leaves the hair smell nice, it doesn't leave you smelling like conditioner all day.It washes out cleanly and leaves hair feeling conditioned without being overly greasy like some salon conditioners.  It also doesn't bother my daughter's skin which has been irritated by value conditioners in the past.  Recommended buy!"
9723,1,Juicy Escape 5/5 Stars_Caress brand &#34;Juicy Escape&#34; body wash fragrance is wonderful. Now I may be a little biased because I am a huge fan of Caress products and have been for several years. This citrus scented fragrance is invigorating and refreshing. I love it! 5/5 stars
4789,1,A Very Good Product Once You Learn How to Use It_The Remington curling wand is a great curling wand once you get used to its difference from curling iron.  Unfortunately the quick heating and high heat element are not just a positive point but also an easy way for the untrained hand to get burned.  Once you get used to using the wand it provides a quick and easy way to curl your hair.*** Positive Points: ***- Quick heating- Digital control with LCD temperature readout make it easy to know how hot it is- Comes with a glove that lets you touch your hot hair as you curl it (though not the wand element).- Reasonable price*** Negative Points: ***- Easy to get burned if you are not careful- Included glove does not protect your hand from the heating element of the wandOverall: This is a great product that makes it easy to curl your hair.  Just be careful to prevent burns until you are used to using it.
3032,1,"mineral power_I have used this for years, it is getting harder to find!  Not many stores sell it anymore.  I like this color and the beige ones as well.  It provides good coverage without being heavy.  Goes on easily.  I hope I can continue to find it, I have not found another I like as well!"
9964,1,"Tightens on your skin and feels so clean!_I used this mask a few times already and am loving it.  First, I made the mistake of using this two days in a row- use it sparingly and only once a week.  Since I changed up my routine it has been perfect.  Spreads evenly, rinses cleanly and doesn't hold much of a smell. It has quality ingredients and leaves my skin feeling super CLEAN!  It tightens on your skin and you can just feel it working.  This all natural mask is certainly a great one to try if you have sensitive skin."
158,1,"LOVED IT, I dyed my little sisters hair_I dyed my little sisters hair and the color turned out amazing she went from being a dirty blonde to a vibrant strawberry ish blonde like the box. It looks fantastic. It goes amazing with green eyes and pale skin. I'm going to use this dye on her from now on. We both love the results!!!!!"
5197,1,"works well_I have used this product for over one year and receive frequent comments on the good condition of my skin. I use it once a day (three-four drops) and it lasts me at least 6 months. I originally purchased another product at a spa for three times this product's cost. This product is equally as effective. My husband does not like the odor of the product, but it does not bother me."
6214,0,"Does nothing_I used to use a terrific temporary-but-instant plumping product from Avon, and unfortunately they stopped making it. Since then I have been looking for a product to replace it, and this is not it. This stuff makes your skin feel tight where you put it, and not in a comfortable way. And it leaves flakes when it dries. Didn't like this AT ALL. I will have to keep looking for my miracle product."
1517,1,"Like it so far_I like this so far, only used it twice. Tingles just a little on skin, I've managed to keep it on 4 minutes already the 2nd time. I'm trying to lighten up some dark spots on the sides of my face. Haven't seen any major improvements yet, but you have to do at least 6 series to notice a difference. I have faith this peel will remove my dark spots!"
5297,1,"Momma loved this stuff_Being a Manly man I wasn't going to test this stuff on my sandpaper skin so I let Mom try it and demanded she write a review for it.She is in her late 60's and she seems to have loved it.Mom wrote:'I can't say make enough positive comments about Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair moisturizer and what it has done for my skin.I started using the moisturizer about three weeks ago, and actually noticed a difference in the texture of my skin after the first week.My skin felt firmer and suppler; in addition there was definitely a diminishing of some of the wrinkles in my forehead.Continued use of this product has resulted in the lessening of some of the deeply grooved laugh lines around my mouth.I'm really excited as I anticipate how my skin will continue to benefit from repeated use of this product.'Seems like a hit with Mom. I guess this means she is going to want more."
7801,1,"Favorite_I have bought all the Anastasia Brow stuff and everything that goes with it.  I saw a review on this particular brow pencil and decided to try it.  I'm SO glad I did.  It is now my favorite.  It just works for me.  It's cheaper, too.  The cap on the spooly part doesn't stay on though...."
2578,1,"Resembles 'Bronze Glitz'_My favorite eye shadow, ever, isMaybelline Expert Wear Shadow Trio, Bronze Glitzhands down.  None of my local stores are carrying it anymore, and it's starting to look like Amazon won't be either.  Currently you can only buy it from a 3rd party seller - for a jacked-up price when you consider the shipping.I tried this compact and found the lid, crease, and brow colors to all be quite reminiscent of the 'Bronze Glitz' colors albeit slightly less brilliant.  The colors in this set are not quite as bright, and have less shimmer than Bronze Glitz.  They do blend well and wear fairly well.  Not as well as Bronze Glitz though.Also, you are getting much less lid and crease color in exchange for the liner color, which I don't use anyway.All in all I like the set, and if I didn't already have a favorite by Maybelline that is similar to this set I'd like it a lot more."
1424,1,yumm_love the smell! I cover part of my water faucet in the tub to help the spray come out faster in order to get more bubbles. Wish I had better water pressure!
1174,1,"Last for years._First of all I use less make up when applying (just a pea size on the cheeks and forehead, and a bit where needed). I bounce the dump sponge all over my face and that`s it! Flawless, natural look. Even my husband commented! For me it`s the best make up applicator (I used foundation brush, make up regular sponge, and my favorite till now fingers).I'm happy I bought the cleanser too, only because I can place sponge on top to dry, and later I replace liquid with other delicate soap. After the sponge is dry I keep it in the original plastic case (separate from the second one by a plastic divider). All clean and easy to use. Latex free if someone`s allergic.The average life of the sponge supposed to be 3 months, but my first sponde lasted 2 years and than started to fall part (because I don`t use it everyday). Easy to clean and storage. I recommend to buy a double pack at once, it`s better value.I'll come back for more for sure!"
7248,1,"GREAT STICK_These DS tapes stay on ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT! I love these ds tapes. They take some practice to master the application, however once you get it right they stay put all day and all night. I am caucasian with one slightly dropping lid and I work 12-18 hrs a day. I apply the tape immediately after washing and drying my face so that there are NO oils/makeup on my lid. It does alter the look of the crease, slightly, however the improvement in the lids being level with one another makes up for that minor difference. I can apply my makeup (liquid foundation or BB Cream) right over the crease and as long as there is no tape exposed, there is no difference in the shading. If the tape as ANY exposed areas they will be DARKER from whatever makeup you apply to the rest of your lid so be sure to have the tape applied so that it isn't sticking out anywhere! It's the fastest way to know if you tape application was dones right but then you have start all over again and wash/dry the lid.Guys, you shouldn't have any problem with these, save for the positioning.I only wish that I could find them in the are where I live because the shipping is 1800 times the cost of the actual tape."
7387,1,"Perfect!!_This is the first time I have ordered a curling wand set. I couldn't have been more thrilled! It not only arrived early, it arrived in perfect condition. After reading one of the reviewer's comments that she had to have her husband help her putting together the wand, I had mine along beside me. First you have to make sure you push the wand firmly into the handle and it will lock into place. I only wish that the instructions would tell you how to do it. When you want to change wands, wait until it is completely cooled. Do not twist, just pull the wand straight out of the handle. It heats up super fast...faster than my flat iron and I mean it was well under a minute. This wand is worth every penny and then some. You get four sizes!"
7091,1,"This Truly Works_So I have a large discoloration above my lip that looks like a mustache and discolorations aobve each eye.  I hate them.  I have bought $300 creams, done microderbrations, gone to dermotogists and nothing has worked to remove these doscolorations.  I have great skin except for these marks.  I used this product one night and the next day the marks had visibly lightened.  I am about to do the third treatment.  this is a great product and it really does work.  Is not as harsh as the spa peels and although theres not much peeling the product is working. Worth the money and worth trying. Better than the pricy stuff."
114,0,"Inexpensive and feels that wY_Kind of drying, not moisturizing. Kind of disappointed. Will have to keep searching  for a good reasonable face moisturizer. It should not cost an arm and a leg."
5469,1,"Beautiful Healthy Glow_I just purchased this 2 days ago in the Translucent and I couldn't believe how pretty not only the compact was but the healthy glow it gave me! It also has a compartment with a mirror & travel brush, very sturdy, too. The different colors blend together to add a glow and correct redness. Grab these while you can, I'm not sure if they are gonna be permanent!"
9520,1,"Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Awapuhi Ginger and Honeysuckle_This conditioner leaves my hair smelling so fresh and clean.  It has a nice scent that is a pleasure to use in the shower.  It's not fruity or sweet smelling, which I like very much.It's safe for color treated hair and was formulated to help with hair breakage.  I am hoping that with continued use, my hair will be stronger.After using this, my hair feels very soft but it doesn't weigh my hair down. It still has a lot of bounce."
7974,1,GAH!!!!!_SO MANY COLORS SUCH PRETTY COLORS THERE MAGNETIC ITS NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS  THEYBARE EARTH COLORS THERE MAGNETIC. oh and did i mention that there magnetic??!?!?
2345,1,"GREAT Polish!_I recomend this for a shiny top coat, but I do have to say it peels slightly easy, but to me I really do not want my nail polish to be difficult to get off!"
6696,1,"Scrub masque_This is a facial scub and mask in one. I do like it, smells good and will burn a bit if you have any open skin areas."
7634,1,Great value_Happy with purchase it is messy but a fan brush will sweep that loose glitter away great value.
3191,1,"Shine_This shampoo makes my hair shiny and soft. It doesn't weigh it down. I don't especially like the scent, but otherwise it really does work well."
8129,1,"Very close to the expensive brands_The whole deal with Olay products is that they are advertised as being as good as the high-end products that cost hundreds more. I've been using this for a couple of weeks now, and while I don't think the people at La Mer are in a corner smoking nervously, this is a great bargain cream that hydrates really well without feeling too greasy or clogging pores. It's a bargain that I'd buy again."
7877,1,Works perfectly and cute!_These artifical nail trimmers do their job and are pretty cute too. The rubber is a little sheer on the handels but thats okay.
9130,1,"Great Coverage for a BB Cream_I enjoyed this product and will definitely buy it in the future. It goes on very smoothly, has a great scent and has great coverage for a BB Cream.BB Stands for Beauty Balm.  BB creams are an all-in-one type of product that can replace several products such as moisturizer, primer, foundation and sunblock - though each BB Cream can advertise what they help with, so read the package.This product claims to be formulated to have tone correction and give you luminous coverage plus with a nice SPF 15.  In addition the product claims to help correct dark spots in 2 weeks.  I am 32 years old and do not have any dark spots on my skin yet, so I am unable to verify if this claim was accurate or not.I was debating between the light and the medium color.  Because fall is approaching I opted for the light color. To compare what color foundation I have used in the past it has beenBare Escentuals Bare Minerals ORIGINAL SPF 15 Foundation (Fairly Light)andUrban Decay Naked Skin Weightless Ultra Definition Liquid Makeup 3 1 ozwhich both I have been professionally matched to my skin tone.The color was great.  It really evened out my skin tone and I appreciated the SPF 15 in the product.  The other BB Cream I have used in the past has beenStila Stay All Day 10-In-One HD Illuminating Beauty Balm With Broad Spectrum SPF 30 1.3 ozwhich I paid nearly $40 for and I had to say, I liked the Ponds product better and it is half the cost!Also the smell is wonderful.  Has a very light flower type smell to it.  Once you put it on, you do not have any scent at all so people that are sensitive to secant do not worry."
4068,1,Four Stars_Makes my skin feel very soft.
9159,1,"Sooo cute!_I originally ordered this from a different company and was sent the wrong thing. It came from overseas and I'd probably end up paying too much for shipping, so I decided to just try a different company. I was a little hesitant because of my last order, but I actually got the right item this time! It fits well, stays in place, is comfortable, and looks adorable. I always get SO many compliments when I wear this out. Love it!"
3923,1,"beautiful grassy holo_Super unique holographic polish! It's my new favorite, it's lovely grass green and like magic doesn't chip and flake right away like most of the other holographic polishes i've tried. it dries quickly and the brush is great!"
509,1,"Great weekend/summer scent_At first this scent seems very subtle, but it's not really - it doesn't get lost.It smells of green horse apples as a strong punch on the top note, with some cucumber, citrus, and classic spicy florals coming in the middle, held up by amber and sandalwood, which I think help boost it's staying power.It's a very modern scent formulation, but also very natural.  Great for daytime, casual, and weekend use.  It's more fun and fresh and playful than really romantic.  I think it would be great for teens as well, as the playful top notes keep it from being overly mature, even as it is a fairly complex scent.It's a sunny meadow, picking juicy green apples while wild roses ramble and horses play."
5563,1,"WOWZA!_First of all the customer service is AMAZING! The product is sooo cool it turned out the color of the pic! Yes it smells like henna and henna smells like henna it's natural; I don't mind the smell at all. It is an unusual smell considering I am used to overly synthetic smells, but it definitely grew on me which is saying a lot b/c I don't like the smells at health food stores! I didn't add any additional ingredients except for the necessary ones. I left it in for 2 hours and the color was a very awesome wine red. The shower cap is nice the size is really good. I have choppy almost mid back hair and I only needed one packet if that, but I used two and so MUCH leftover! If you go out everyday or work use this on a weekend, if you are a stay at home mom and don't have to go out use it on a Monday to give it time to work the color out of your scalp. I thought my face was going to be stained b/c I got it on my cheeks (and my skin is SOOO dry) but it came right off without really any effort (even after the two hours). My hair is still running when I wash it however, I expected that I just make sure I dry it thoroughly when I am done so the color doesn't transfer to anything; I do recommend either using a towel you don't care about or that you can bleach b/c you will need to wrap your hair up in it to catch initial drips until it stops running. Also I wanted to note I used lime juice b/c I was out of anything else and it worked fine. I have been using conditioner to wash my hair but I am getting ready to switch back to coconut milk...so if you haven't tried the 'no poo method' now is a great time to start. All in all a million stars if I could but I will leave 5 since it's all I can leave. THANKS!"
622,1,so helpfull_fast shipping. works great. and pretty much  a time saver with this device to help dry nails. will buy from them again.
4360,1,Best Dryer I Have Ever Bought!_I LOVE this hair dryer!!!  By far the best I have ever bought!!  I love the different diffuser attachments!!  My hair dries so quickly and is soft and silky.
5433,1,Great remover_I have used this for years and was disappointed that my local Target stopped carrying it.  I was pleased to find it here on Amazon with a comparable price.  It does not leave my eyes oily unlike almost every other product I've tried.
8437,1,"Love the Clear products_I've reviewed several other hair products from Clear, so I had high expectations for this shampoo, and was not disappointed. The smell is fabulous, and the conditioner is light enough to not weigh hair down, but substantial enough to really feel great. This works wonderfully on the frizzies I get sometimes, and I love it as my everyday conditioner."
6666,1,"Great buy_These are great little gems that look nice and were easy to apply with topcoat. I'm not gonna count, but just by looking it's obvious that there is not 100 of each color. It looks closer to 50 each. Even for half the number, this is definitely worth the price, and I will happily buy more when I run out of these.The only other issue I experienced was that my gems showed up in one of those wheel holders, not the (much handier) clasp holder shown in the picture. These build up static electricity, so the gems kinda get everywhere and mix together when you open the container. It's not the worst though, I'll probably just buy a new organizer at a craft store.Overall, still a great buy. :)"
4720,1,great for bottom lashes_Great for bottom lashes and for fixing and clumps its very precise and easy to use this is a repurchase for me I've used this before and I still like it I highly recommend for anyone looking for a easier way to apply mascara to bottom lashes and move around tight angles and zone in on hard to reach eye lashes
2347,1,"Amazing_Everyone said it. This top coat is magnificent. I have really short natural nails so after one application i noticed chipping on the edges by like the 5th day and my rhinestone designs were still holding on tight. I will touch my edges up by the 3rd day to get a much longer wear, but for the most part this stuff is way better than a lot of topcoats i have tried in the pas. I will be stocking up on this brand from now on. I wish I would've found it sooner."
2418,1,waiting to see_hoping for the best.  I had a tiny amount of peeling...like with a light sunburn!  Maybe I should have gotten a stronger solution.
7290,1,"Nail art tape_very pretty! I can create some very unique designs with the tape.  It does take patience to apply it, but I think the result worth it in the end.  Shipping was fast and packaging was good.  Very satisfied!"
7624,1,"Pleasantly surprised_I usually buy MAC eyeshadows (neutral colors), but I was wanting to branch out try out colors that weren't so neutral and didn't want to spend a fortune on shadows that I might've not liked. I saw this palette and was interested in all the bright colors, but I was worried by how cheap it was (in my experience, cheap = bad quality usually). With it being so cheap, figured I didn't have much to lose though. I haven't tried out all the colors, but the ones I've tried so far I'm impressed with. They're very pigmented (maybe not as much as MAC, but for the price they can't be beat), go on nicely/blend well, and stay throughout the day. I should mention I do use the Urban Decay primer potion in Eden before applying it, as I do with all the eyeshadows I use so I can't comment how well the shadows do without a primer. I'm still shocked I spent less than $15 for (a LOT of) good quality eyeshadows. Highly recommend this palette, whether you're just starting out with makeup and don't want to spend a lot of money, or you just want to add to your eyeshadow collection ."
1005,0,"doesn't lather and doesn't smell good_Got this for my husband and he hated it so I decided to use it up so as not to waste it but I can't stand it either, it just won't form a lather and smells very unpleasant - you keep on using more to try and get a lather going.  To be honest, neither of us could bring ourselves to use it long enough to see if it had any therapeutic effect so I am giving it two stars for its possible effectiveness."
1608,1,Four Stars_works good.
2824,1,"The best I have found for the price_This works.  Simply, it does work & well.  The price is the best I have found of any natural sunscreen (price for the ounces).  I feel safe to use it on the whole family & will continue to buy it.  The only complaint is that it can leave a white residue if not rubbed in quickly enough or applied to many times close together (like during an outing).  But it works and is safe so it's good in my book."
2319,1,Rated highly by an 'Axe Man'_I thought my  boyfriend would be perfect to try this since I know he already likes Axe products; especially their deodorant.  The Detailer Shower Tool did not disappoint.  It first gave him 'an excuse' to go out and buy the Axe shower gel. He says that he had a very invigorating shower and he loved how it lathered. He especially noted how well the scrub side smoothed out his rough heels.He probably wouldn't have bought this but now that he has it...really likes it and continues to use it.  He hates the word metrosexual but at least Axe does a great job in disguising that word.
5239,1,One of my all-time eyeshadow favorites!_The silver has always been a favorite product of mine. Can easily be applied dry. It lasts all day and has kind of a creamy texture to it. It's the perfect Tin Man silver. It definitely draws attention. The black also glides on smoothly. It doesn't really have any problems with creasing and will stay put all day as well. I highly recommend this product!
2747,1,Use as eyebrow gel_I use this as eyebrow gel and have for years.  I have never tried it as clear mascara.  Love the stuff!
5161,1,"Good product!_let me start by saying that I have used products from Beauty Control, Avon, Mary Kay, and Dove. I can honestly say this is my favorite!I have found Youth Code to be a joy to use. It's nice and light, which I like very much. Even the nighttime cream seems to be light, doesn't feel heavy on your skin. The smell is very faint and pleasant.I am a woman in her mid 50's with just one dry patch by my eyes. I have been using the products for 2 weeks and am amazed that there really is a difference. My skin really does look younger!I gave Youth Code 4 stars instead of 5 because it is a bit pricey for the size of the products. That can be a deal breaker on my budget."
4696,1,"NOW Foods cinnamon Cassia Oil_It is that time of the year when the scent of cinnamon oil begins wafting through the air of my home and mingling with other holiday smells.  This particular oil is very hot.  A word of warning:  if you are going to use this for a lip-plumping agent.  Use it sparingly in your lip balm.  If you do not, you are going to be sorry.  This is great cinnamon oil.  I like to pair it with Rosebud lip balm as a lip plumper."
9188,1,Bright!_It is not orange like the other reviews said. It's very coral pink. And it did stay on through lunch. It will be a great summer color!
4704,1,"One of proactivs best!_I love this product. I had acne break outs in high school and used the three step process. It seemed to help. But 8 years later, after I got married I was able to find that using this with the toner was a much better regimen for my face.  It is less drying for me but still cleanses. I love, love love the little beads in this cleanser. I use it daily  and it provides a little exfoliation.This bottle specifically was good value because of the size. I also like that this came with a pump. It seems less messy and more quick to use."
5897,1,"Lots of Lashes- LOVE_I love this mascara.  I always try other ones, then keep coming back to this one.  The shape is perfect for getting the long lashes on the outside and small ones on the inside.  It goes on smoothly, lasts all day.  This does make my lashes look thicker, and longer.  One of the girls at work said that I look like I could be in a Lash Blast commercial!  (wrong company, but whatever!)"
9005,0,"More Of A Mess Maker_Toni&Guy Casual Sculpting Powder seems like a great idea but I wasn't impressed. It's hard to get out of the tiny tube and when it does come out it's more of a combination of fine powder and chunky clumps that made my hair feel sticky. It was also difficult to wash out too. I was hoping to get better results styling my fine hair like some of my favorite singers and movie stars are wearing. I think I'll stick with my arsenal of gels, spritzes, and mousse."
2928,1,"love it_While researching Wen reviews several people mentioned Hair One, so I searched out other blogs online & found the same reviews mentioning how great this product works & that it is really a wonderful comparison to Wen at half the price. Sally Beauty Supply does carry this product, yet finding it in stock can be an issue. Our local store manager told me lots of people come in for Hair One & it's hard to keep it stocked. Amazon is my back up if I can't get any locally. Either way the price is great compared to Wen. My hair is thinning, color treated, natural curly down to my waist. I do not use heat or styling products. Over time using chemicals, perms & styling aids with heat my hair started thinning, so I've adopted a more natural approach & use several oils on my hair, along with Hair One. The results are great and for the price its worth a try. Everything builds up in my hair over time, so I use Garnier, they have a 'Clean' shampoo & conditioner that contain no silicone to remove buildup. That works great, or else I have used the one by Paul Mitchel that removes everything, just once a month."
5099,0,"YUCK!_Zits, zits, zits, and more zits is what this product gave me. I've never had bad acne. If you really WANT acne, give this a try, it'll fix you up in only a few days, for only a waste of money! WOO!"
4741,1,I like it. smell very nicely- smooth to apply_I like it . smell very nicely- smooth to apply . will buy again
1671,1,"Works Great_I bought this to try instead of a plain heat protectant spray.  I think it's great.  It's definitely a bit thick, but I have fine hair and have never felt it to be heavy or greasy.  I only spray maybe 6 sprays over my whole head though, but it works awesome and my hair is shiny and healthy.  I'll definitely keep buying this."
7006,1,Nexxus Frizz Defy_Good shampoo for straight hair. xoxo
9217,1,"Cleans and Softens Skin, Has a Pleasant Fragrance_I really like these cleansing cloths, because unlike some drugstore brands I've tried, they removed ALL my makeup.Here's what I was wearing:BB creamconcealercream blushmascara (NOT waterproof)lipstickHere's how I used the cloths:Took one cloth, wiped it over my entire face, finishing with the eye area. Turned the cloth over, wiped again. Then, I rinsed with warm water, took ANOTHER cloth, and repeated the above.I'm writing about the way I used them, because the directions do NOT say you must rinse after using. I just prefer that.As to how they cleaned: after using the FIRST towel (one side) there was NO makeup left on my face. I used the second side of the towlette to be sure, but it came away clean.So why did I use a second wipe? For the softening effect, which I knew I'd rinsed off.Ingredients include: glycerine, castor oil, lemon fruit extract, ginko biloba leaf extract and ALSO a number of other, chemical ingredients, including sodium lauryl sufate and methylparaben.For those who object to parabens in their products, those chemicals I listed might be a problem. Also, if you object to products made in China, be aware that these are produced there.As for me, I liked the job these did cleaning and softening the skin, and the fact that they have a mild, pleasant fragrance made them even nicer to use."
4768,1,"Straight & Smooth with no Snags.... Super!_I have never straightened my hair before I got this... not because I don't need to (I have wavy hair that tends to frizz) but because I'm lazy about my hair.  But I figured I'd give it a shot when I was offered the straightener on Vine.First of all, even for a novice like me, it was very easy to work.  It was also convenient... it gets hot fast and has a cool swivel cord.  But best of all, it made my hair so sleek and pretty!  I kept looking at myself in the mirror!  And it didn't snag or snarl as I smoothed the plates down the strands.To me it seemed perfect, but since I had no basis for comparison I had my college-aged niece take it for a spin.  She said she liked it as much as her straightener which cost $100.  Cool.Am I still lazy about my hair?  You betcha.... a straightener can't fix that.  BUT I like the ease and result of this straightener enough that I will break it out for special occasion dressup-y events."
2510,1,Best glitter polish ever._I'm done looking - I can't believe they discontinued this. Are they mad? Perfect glitter... so pretty in just one coat.
609,1,"Unlike Other Clarifying Shampoos_This one keeps your hair so soft without drying it out, as many clarifying shampoos have a tendency to do.  Your hair feels completely clean.  This is a great poo for after deep oil treatments.. e.g. I like to use coconut oil to treat my hair once a week to keep it in tip top shape.  Highly recommend!"
86,1,"Good Product_I continue to use Neutrogena Clear Pore Oil Eliminating Astringent because it works.  The only problem that I had with this purchase is that it leaked in the mail.  Fortunately, it was wrapped in plastic and the loss was minimal but it was disappointing not to receive the full amount of liquid."
6858,1,Smells great!_I love this compared to other lotions because it smells like bubblegum. I use this lotion in addition to a bronzer and I see great results with the two
8163,1,"Great!_I love these and they work very well.  I watched a few videos on how to use them so when I received them, it was easy to get use to it.  The only thing that makes gives my hair beautiful curls that last all day with no heat.  Definitely not comfortable to sleep in but that's to be expected.  If you want them to work faster, you can take a blow dryer to them so your hair dries faster.  I only use a leave in conditioner before putting them in, then I let it air dry for 4-6 hours or more if I'm not going any where.  Then I use a light hairspray after and the curls stay in all day and even into the next day.  I've packed my curling iron and wand away since these work way better."
3526,1,"Nice_Wow, i used this with my Clarisonic body brush and my skin looks and feels amazing. My husband loves it."
4375,1,"Works fine, smells gross._My only qualm with this product is how bad it smells. I can't even describe what it smells like, but it isn't pleasant. It works great, protects my skin from sun damages and moisturises it perfectly fine. Unfortunately, based on the smell of this product alone, I won't be purchasing again. I really don't like it."
9276,1,"Great price, great brush_Awesome brush and how the heck do you beat this price? Really soft, but not too mushy. Applies foundation beautifully. Would absolutely recommend."
6187,1,just ok_I really like  this product but I will use it more for highlite my face. Have too much reflection for the whole face. Of course my personal taste.
9998,1,"Use it for everything_First I started using this oil on my face, but now I use it on everything.  I use all over my body, and even started using it in my hair, and it has improved everything."
9711,1,"A Drop Or Two Will Do Ya!_A Drop Or Two Will Do Ya!  My wife has been using other Vitamin C drop's for awhile now and decided to try RevitaVie because of the addition of E and A. E we know is a good internal supplement to take for the body and A, I believe is a carotene which is good for the eyes(moisture?). Anyway she is happy with the vitality her skin is exuding and she believes her wrinkle lines may be fading. Only continued use will be the proof in the pudding."
3351,1,Ecotools Bamboo Bristle Bath Brush_This is a good bath brush. Soft bristles and once piece wood design with lanyard. Just a sort of soft to medium scrubbing feel from bristles and once piece wood so not to fall apart or decay as fast.
853,1,"long lasting, powdery_I got this EDT after reading all the good reviews. It last morning to evening and I am happy about that. But I did not hugely like the powdery smell (and that's why I took one star off)."
7080,0,"NEEDLE TOOL_THE NEEEDLE PART OF THIS TOOL IS TOO DULL!  I NEEDS TO BE ALOT SHARPER, BECAUSE AS IT IS, IT DAMAGES THE SKIN"
6148,0,You get what you pay for_The low cost is proof that it is a cheap product. Doesn't do the job of a dry shampoo. Darn
7153,1,"Best Way To Take Off Gel Nail Polish_I purchased these after a manicurist used them on me during a procedure. I previously used to soak off my gel nail polish with a bowl of acetone. That seemed to take forever. These little babies are awesome. Dip the little pads in the polish remover, and wrap around your nails. The wraps will be somewhat secure, as secure as tinfoil on your nails can be. I found it easier to do one hand at a time, because it can be somewhat hard to wrap both hands at once. Wait for about 15-20 minutes and your polish will be melted enough to remove easily. Yes you can probably achieve the same effect with tin foil and cotton balls, but that's a lot of effort when these are already pre-made. I recommend!"
4232,1,"Love the smell_This product is great for my hair,especially my dry ends.It also smells yummy which means i am more likely to continue regular use"
3075,1,"Quick, complete, gentle straightener._This tool is more gentle on the hair than other straighteners I've used, and even at lower heat, works very well. My hair feels silky without any additional product."
590,0,"Gets Hair Clean, But Is Very Strong_I liked this shampoo, because of how clean it got my hair. I saw the dirt go down the drain as I rinsed the product out which made me feel like I was really cleaning my hair. But it has Salicylic Acid in it, so it is very strong and my hair was falling out as I washed it. I have never lost that much hair in a shampooing process! This product further tangled, snagged and snapped my 4C hair. This shampoo is probably best for STRAIGHT hair textures. I would not recommend this product for curlier textures."
4951,0,I don't like it._I don't like it. So sad I believe other review and but it without smell it first. The smell is for an old lady.
6079,1,"love this lotion_I absolutely love this cream and love this company! ...the cream has a different smell to others as it contains carrot seed oil, which has a strong earthy smell (as you would expect coming from a carrot!)but I wouldnt exactly say its offensive as others have suggested. Just different. I am familiar with carott seed oil and personally love it.The lotion is such a great price, rich but not greasy and is full of good things that the biggest porous organ of your body (your skin!)will love.In response to other reviewers disappointment, I personally dont expect any lotion to reduce any wrinkles I already have...Im 39 and definitely see some differences in my skin over the years BUT, human nature dictates, we get older, and things change...To have my skin feel 'fed and nourished' with this cream is the best thing I can do and I believe that in itself may hopefully slow down the whole process :)  Healthy glowing ladies look wonderful, wrinkles and all!Thankyou so much Loving Naturals for producing such wonderful guilt free products. You have a permanent repeat customer xxx"
1711,1,Best cleaning product_I bought this product from another company which was more expensive then Amazon(of course).  I use this brush head with my Clarisonic cleaning system.  It is a great product.  You can definitely feel the difference in the way your face feels after you've cleaned it.  I used to use the normal cleansing brush which was okay but once I found out about the deep pore brush 'It was on and poppin'.  Even my 15 year old son uses it everyday to wash his face.
3250,1,"This product does INDEED fade age spots!!_I ordered this product in Dec 2012 and I waited to write this review until I had finished one full bottle. I am very pleased to say that the terrible age spots on my face have noticibly faded. I apply this product night and morning, with a q-tip because trying to dispense it into my hands with the dropper is very difficult. So, forget the dropper and use a q-tip if you want to use the product both efficiently and sparingly. I highly recommend it for those of us who have dark age spots on the face and neck."
2328,1,"TOPS_Once you start using WEN you will never go back.  If you've never tried it, please check out how to properly use the product in YouTube.  I have color treated hair with highlights that never goes dull, is soft and manageable, and no frizzies!"
9960,1,"Excellent Natural Restorative Hair Care Product!_InstaNatural's Luxurious Hair Treatment and Elixir is a blended combination of that wonder oil- Argan Oil with Coconut Oil, Jojoba Oil, Olive Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Sunflower Oil and Shea Butter combined into a hydrating leave-in conditioner. There is an ongoing search for the hair care product that will help to tame my uncooperative tresses and including this Argan Oil Hair Treatment and Elixir to my exclusive trusted product list is a noted accomplishment. While my hair is not particularly dry or damaged, it does require a seemingly excessive amount of product to maintain a smooth, sleek style. Staying true to my usual brands of shampoo and conditioner, I used the hair treatment as a leave in conditioner that was conveniently pumped from the bottle without any messy dripping or spilling all over my clothing. The ease of detangling and styling my hair after an overnight application of the Hair Treatment and Elixir was such a transformation. My hair had a shine and softness that made my day.  The manageability was improved, the smoothness and bounce of my hair after a quick straightening were so simple to attain that I repeated the process the very next day.  An excellent restorative product that proves that InstaNatural is making a reputation as the place to go for hair and skin care, the natural way. - See more at: http://niecyisms.blogspot.com/2014/06/skin-care-natural-way-with-instanatural.html#more"
4452,1,Move over Chanel Glossimer!!!_I have been using Chanel Glossimer lip gloss and love it until I started using this.  It's just like the Chanel Glossimer but cheaper.  It moisturizes really well and is sheer and NON STICKY!!!!
6262,1,"Smells great, good quality product_I bought this in the store to use on my baby fine frequently knotted hair. It smells great, and did unknot it fairly well."
100,1,"Maybelline >Dior_I recently switched to Maybelline Full n Soft after using Dior mascara for the past 5 years.  This product is reasonably priced and is fantastic.  My lashes still feel soft after applying 3 coats. Love, Love, Love this product."
4715,1,BEST LOTION_Recommended by my dermatologist and the Restoraderm is best lotion EVER.  Really helps moisturize and disguise this old body's wrinkles.  It's better than any restorative cream that sells in fancy stores for 10 times the price.
8869,1,"For Special Events_This was not for me because my hair is now shoulder length and bobbed. But my adult nieces both have long hair and were excited to test this for me.Initially they had a little bit of a learning curve but after a few mishaps, the results were beautiful on their long, thick hair.The iron gets very hot quickly and comes with a glove to help you hold your hair and avoid burns. I don't think this is for every day use, but for a special night out that is worth the added effort, they think the results were great."
2889,0,VERY difficult_i was looking for a new eyeliner that wasn't a pencil i saw this and read the reviews and this seemed like a good product. i love the color of it but this is very difficult for me to put on the brush is horrible and is very rough and hurts. If you have a very steady hand this might be good for you. The best eyeliner that i ever had was bobbi brown fluidline eyeliner. This is very creamy and if you make a mistake you are done.
5830,1,Shimmer and Shine_Love the shimmer and shine I get with this. you have to try the colors befor you judge the colors in these packs. they have a glitter  coat on top and it hides the real color of each one so you may think your getting duplicates when your not its a different color. I love using these with other matte colors i have to tone down some of the shine or to add some sparkle to an a mazing matte color i already have.
321,1,"Great toner!_I use this after every workout. It cleans my face and neck without leaving my skin dry. My skin feels so smooth and supple and the scent is very pleasing to me. I have been keeping it in a zip-lock in my gym bag, just in case the top comes loose, and I have had no spills. Even though I use this stuff every time I work out (about 8-10 times a week), I can tell that this is going to last me a long time! I highly recommend this product and will buy again in the future."
9686,1,"Love Dove_I have used this shampoo for several weeks.  It is light and makes my hair feel very clean. It moisturizes, but doesn't leave behind any residue. Smells great!  Shipping packaging was not great - the bottle arrived 3/4 empty with shampoo all over the packaging-- easy solution: tape the top of the bottle to secure it."
6076,1,"Very light n love the smell._I found this product very light on the hair and the smell is awesome. But for some reason, this wasn't very effective on my hair. So, tried returning. But this product can't be returned. Amazon gladly issued me a refund."
9909,1,"Charcoal Sponge Makes a Great Face Cleanser_Have you heard of konjac sponges? I had no idea what they were when I saw them advertised on a number of beauty sites. I've been using my pureSOL konjac sponge for the past couple of weeks. The sponge is made from the all-natural konjac root and used to gently cleanse and exfoliate your face.The sponge I purchased has added bamboo charcoal making it look a bit like a lump of charcoal. Don't let that scare you. Before using the sponge for the first time you need to soak it in warm water until soft.  The instructions said you could use it with plain water, so that's what I did the first time I tried it but felt it didn't throughly cleanse my skin, especially the areas around my forehead, nose and chin.I have combination skin that is oily in the T-Zone so the 2nd time I tried the konjac sponge I used it with a small drop of my favorite liquid facial soap. You gently rub the konjac sponge all over your face, in a circular motion. Then rinse your face with clean water and pat dry with a soft cloth. If you normally use moisturizer after you wash your face, then go ahead and use your favorite brand of facial lotion.After use, rinse out the sponge, wring out the water then hang it up to dry. The pureSOL konjac sponge comes with a suction cup you can attach to your shower wall so the sponge has time to dry out between uses. pureSOL claims the sponge will last about 2-3 months at which time it should be thrown out. It's a 100% biodegradable product and will fully decompose once you throw it out or add it to your compost bin.It is an interesting product, give it a try!"
6299,1,"So smooth_This feels so glamorous and smooth on my skin.  I use it at night and in the morning. My only problem is I have to buy two because they dont make a bigger one. If they do, I haven't found it. It has the spf so I can wear it alone if I'm just going to mow the lawn. It doesn't break my face out.  I would recommend this."
5832,1,"Good, but had problems._I had ordered this, but the first time I received it I got it broken with pieces missing. So, I reported it and they were extremely helpful and gave me an exchange. When I got my replacement it came cracked on the side, but nothing tape couldn't fix so it won't break. Other than the problems mentioned this nail polish rack is great. I like it."
8174,1,white_great for french tips
8659,1,"Great masculine scent_My husband's a big fan of Dove's men's line, and he loves this antiperspirant. He says it works great, and the scent is perfect (subtle but masculine and doesn't conflict with aftershave.)I like it, too. Some men's antiperspirants are very strong. The more a man sweats, the scent is just overpowering.Not so with Dove. Good product, value priced."
4044,1,love it!_I got this ONLINE from my wish list here on Amazon. Im all for buying lotions in the salon but my salon dosent have this in yet and I wanted it. Well I have most of the designer skin 2010 line and I LOVE this one. I feel like SILK Its way more moisturizing  then black. I love it and you do see pretty much instant color. I Love this lotion and I notice like a tiny little super light shimmer on my skin from this. Its really a great product. I def love this lotion its worth the amazon price for sure and the packaging is so cute that little luminary sign lights up! Aw lol but its annoying getting the lotion out of the bottle with it. However just be really careful when ordering ur lotion online to make sure it dosent freeze cause then the lotion is no longer any good so make sure ur expecting the mail and get it in right away. My mail ppl are great so they just throw it on the ground on the ice so I went upstairs and checked for it my other face lotion from alaffia was frozen but THANK GOD this lotion wasn't I opened it RIGHT away to check. SO yea its totally worth the price it smells good before and after tanning and it feels amazing. Most importantly it WORKS!
7779,1,"very lovely, but sharp_i love everything about these bows, except the corners. they are a great size, great quality, perfect. but the corners need to be filed. they are very sharp and i scratch myself often. but if they are filed enough, they dont hurt in the slightest"
503,1,"Great for fine, thin hair_I picked this product up at Walmart on a whim, and really liked it.  I just reordered the bigger bottle from Amazon because the price per ounce is less than buying smaller bottles.I have curly, fine caucasian hair that gets weighed down by some products.  Without any product on it, it gets frizzy.  So I'm always looking for something that gives it volume and keeps my curls defined without making it look dirty or flat.After shampooing, I spray this on my towel dried hair, comb it through then shake my head and scrunch the curls.  My hair dries in nice ringlets but doesn't have that 'wet' look that gels give it, or the crispy or stiff feel that hairspray gives it.I also like it for times that I blow dry my hair.  It slightly amplifies the volume without making it 80s-big.  I still use a touch of hair spray after blow drying, as this Rusk product seems to need a little help in holding a style.I'll continue to buy this product, and recommend it to anyone who has fine or thin hair."
2647,0,not impressed_not impressed. as the day progresses it gets a dry feel and look even though the gloss was repeatedly applied
2735,1,"nice_This is wonderful and will last forever. Really helps my nails look better. Add to your manicure routine, no more buying nail files."
4850,1,love this color_love this color!  This is the only color I wear because it's goes from daytime to evening and even to black tie so well.
3955,1,Great_I love it . Exactly what i was looking for.It smells so good.This was a good deal for such big sizes of body wash
5666,1,very fun_very fun idea to do nails at home.  I like the twirly pattern and the multi sizes are great ....
6584,1,"Colorful with awesome textures_I love this set. It provides a variety of brightly colored nail polishes in different 'textures' like matte, glitter, pearlized, etc... so you can get different looks for every day or special occasions."
3697,0,"Ok_The color is great and it last, but it cakes on my eyes. It creases on my lines, looks horrible!"
6602,1,"Do your own Shellac at home!_I purchased the light and the Shellac top, bottom, and color coats from Amazon and every time I do my own nails I say &#34;I just made $35.00!&#34;"
6245,1,"nice nude color_a little thick. works nicely with a gloss over the top. nice nude. not pink or peach, just medium tan."
7234,1,"Multi use in brushes._Have not used this for my nails yet but I did use the extra brush to line my eye lids with my liquid liner. Omg, it works so well... What a steal!!"
635,1,"They work!_I use these strips weekly to every other week, and my pores have been a lot cleaner and smaller. The very first time I used these, my strip was full of nasty business. As I used them weekly, the strips came off cleaner and cleaner. I used to have bad problems with blackheads on my nose before using this. Now, everything is more manageable. I still get blackheads, but I feel more relieved to see that I am able to clean my pores more thoroughly. I have not been getting as many large acne spots on my nose since using this product either (that may have been due to the clogged pores I used to have). I highly recommend this if you are prone to clogged pores on your nose and have those particularly large pimples in this area now and then. I rarely get them anymore and I'm so happy! I also use the strips on either side of my nose/cheek/chin areas, and they work to clean these parts as well. I have oily skin, but it was easy to get dryness in the area if I used the strips too often. Weekly use seems to offer good balance and pore management. Also, do not wait for longer than 15 minutes to remove the product. By this time, the strip is ready to come off, and it can be painful if you have tiny hairs. These strips really do take up a lot of dirt, dead skin, and hair in the area."
3131,1,"Jergens Soft Shimmer Skin Radiance Moisturizer_This is a great product!  It softens and moisturizes skin, AND it leaves a shimmery glow too!!  I think Jergen does not make this product any longer.  What a pity!!  However, you can still buy it on the Web.  Note:  It is NOT a self-tanning lotion."
1433,1,"Love it_I love this product not just for my hair but my skin as well!  I put a couple drops on the end of my hair after a shower which makes my drier ends feel healthy and moisturized and gives a nice shine.  I also work 2 drops into my face after toner and before moisturizer at night (like a serum).  It gives my skin a lovely, healthy glow without feeling greasy (even though I have oily skin), and I've noticed that small blemishes seem to shrink and fade a little quicker for me without being emphasized by flakiness I'm tempted to over-exfoliate.  This may not work on everyone's skin though...I know some people just cannot deal with oil on their face, but for my skin type (which is rather oily but only breaks out if I don't give it enough moisture) it's been great.  Have been using this every night for a few weeks and have not had a breakout from it.  As with any oil though, use sparingly throughout hair concentrating on the ends so it doesn't look greasy.  I have very thick hair and just work 2-3 drops into my ends and lightly pass my hands over the rest of my hair afterwards...Highly recommend this product for anyone looking for some great natural moisture that is light, easily absorbed and not too greasy.  People sensitive to fragrance will also appreciate that this has no smell.  :)"
5641,1,"Decent Stuff_Lasts for a bit, but not terribly long.  The price and color options are good, but it only lasts an hour or two, not several hours.  The size is big and the chapstick clear lip balm piece broke the first time I use it.  The clear lip balm side isn't that great, but the stain marker is good."
2366,1,I like it_This is a nice product it wasn't oily and a little darker than what i needed nonetheless I can use powder to make it lighter. The product arrived earlier than I expected and wrapped well
6464,0,"Not so simple and not so great_This is a very thin and thin moisturizer. I won't use it on my face because of the problems some have experienced but I have used it on my hands. While it does provide some moisture and it is good that it doesn't have a scent it is not so simple in the ingredient list..  It doesn't sound all natural or even simple to me---Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Polyglyceryl 3 Methylglucose Distearate, Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), Cetyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Borago Officinalis Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Potassium Hydroxide, Pentylene Glycol, Bisabolol, Acrylates/C10 30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Mica, Serine, urea, Sorbitol, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Citric Acid, Methylisothiazolinone, Phenoxyethanol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)"
5460,1,"Works well.._Used to use a creamy eye make-up remover but it just wasn't cutting it. This works well (yes, you do need to shake it first, well, before you use it). I prefer shaking it, twisting the lid off, then holding a cotton ball to the bottle opening, because it's too liquidy to just neatly pour a dab on a cotton ball using the little spout (literally poured out, hit the cotton ball, bounced off, and went all over my sink the first time I used). Product did leak a little when shipped, even though it was thoroughly taped up by the shipper, still leaked. This Alba's fault, put one of the peal off tabs on the opening of the bottle or something! But, again, good product, wiped my water-proof mascara off likety split."
4875,1,"FAVORITES!!!!_I use them over and over again, they look perfect! I'm ordering my second pack, each pack lasts about 2 months for me because I reuse them until they're stiff and break. Worth the price!"
9721,1,"Juicy Escape does the job_This Juicy Escape body wash claims 'Sun-kissed lily and grapefruit essence.'  The ingredients list 'fragrance,' so I don't know if any of the scent comes from actual lily or grapefruit, but I suspect not or it would have been bragged.  Either way, it smells good - not enough grapefruit to smell like the grapefruit essential oil I have and love, but pleasant anyway.  ('Juicy Escape' is not the most appealing name for a product.)This does a great job of cleaning, and I like the way my skin feels after using it.  It lathers nicely, especially when I use one of those little nylon net balls, so a little product goes a long way.  It seems to rinse off nicely.  This is a great everyday product, and one I will continue to use, although I like the scent ofCaress Body Wash, Aqua Sparkle, 18 Ouncemore."
1611,1,"Glowstick happiness_PERFECT, PERFECT, PERFECT! Everything about this product exceeded my expectations! The shipping process went way faster than I expected but that is never a bad thing! :)"
9494,1,"2 IN 1_I absolutely love that this is both a shampoo and a conditioner, and that is is so cost effective. I love Suave products in general because they are of good quality for a reasonable price. The two in one products never moisturize as well as using a separate conditioner but this one works very well and smells great, I like the ease of use, smell and clean feeling I get when using this product and my husband likes how it smells and used it also. I used it on my five year old and have not received any complaints from him either."
6439,1,Used but still in working order_This was obviously a used stamping set. There was still polish on the stamper and what not. It was also slightly older. I cleaned off the stamper and tossed the scraper (using a gift card to scrape). It's in fine working condition. Not enough of a big deal to send it back. It works to stamp.
5707,1,"Love it-- a true purple!_I am a Gelish fanatic and am always looking for purple.  Plum and Done is my favorite so far, as some colors end up being more pink than purple.  I really like it."
3039,1,"Performs decently as a bronzer_I bought this in a dark shade because it is matte and I wanted to try it for contouring. I have to say it works pretty well, it blends very well. However, I will pick a slightly lighter color next time for contouring as I have chosen a much too dark shade now, but that is simply my fault."
2090,1,Skin smooth and lines less noticable_I have been using this product for quite some time. I am 60 years old and I cannot tell you how many compliments I get on the smoothness of my skin. People often guess my age as 50 or less. I do have fine lines but I use product faithfully 2 times a day and they are less noticeable. I also use the Oil of Olay eye cream which I purchased at the same time.  Definitely recommend this to other women.
5486,1,GREAT FLAT IRON_THIS IS A GREAT FLAT IRON I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT .IT GETS HOT QUICK HAS SETTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH HAIR TYPE. EASY TO HANDLE. NOW AFTER READING SOME OF THE REVIEWS BEFORE I BOUGHT IT IT DOES GET KIND OF WARM ON THE HANDLE PART BUT NOT EXTREMELY HOT ACCORDING TO MY DAUGHTER WHO HAS THE FLAT IRON NOW AND SHE LOVES  IT BETTER THAN HER OTHER ONE.IT JUST WOULDN'T WORK ON MY HAIR THE WAY I WANTED NEVER BEEN MUCH OF A CURLING IRON OR FLAT IRON PERSON MORE LIKE HOT ROLLERS. IT HEATS TO 455 DEGREES.IT DOES TAKE OUT THE FRIZZ AND MAKES IT STRAIGHT AND WILL EVEN GIVE A LITTLE CURL.SHE SAYS IT IS THE PERFECT ONE FOR HER.IT IS VERY INEXPENSIVE AND A GREAT DEAL.HOPE THIS HELPS.
3847,1,High pigmented super long lasting blush!_When I first went to apply this blush I did it all wrong. I got used to the lesser pigmented blushes and went for the gusto. I ended up looking like a circus clown. Second try.. One sweep and a blow on the blush brush and I get the perfect blush glow. Because of the high pigment this blush has lasted me forever and a day. Well done NYX!
8474,1,"Convenience is Key_Axe 3-in-1 shampoo-conditioner and body wash is convenience all in one very durable, easy to hold, bottle. The scent is 'manly', but not overpowering, it lathers well, and leaves a clean feeling. I would recommend this product."
6393,1,Great brush_I used this brush for putting in my brow crease and it works like a charm.  I am totally stuck on Sigma brushes they are of the highest quality.
969,1,Fast heat and good quality_This little guy is good quality and do its job. I bought it for my wife and it is good product. Also it was on sale and I was lucky get it on time. Simple to use. Of course don't forget use it in a safer way.
8240,1,"perfect for practice_Great to practice on. Sturdy and good qualiity. The only negative thing I can say, is tjat they are all the same size."
3098,0,"You mine as well use invisible pencil_I'm not sure if there was any actual product inside the eyeliner, because when I went to draw it around my eyes NOTHING happened. You can't see this product at all, it makes almost no color. Cosmic black is a joke!"
6511,1,Nice Product_I use this product in-between shampoos. Overall it works well and is fairly priced. I have used much much more expensive brands but this product is equal to performance to brands in which I have paid $15. It has a pleasant smell and I have never had an issue with the contents not coming out of the can. I would recommend this product.
6467,1,"Excellent facial cleanser vegan & vegetarian friendly_This moisturizing facial wash does a great job of removing make-up while being gentle to my skin. It is perfume free and made by the US Alberto Culver Company. Since it doesn't contain any animal products, it is perfect for use by vegans and vegetarians. It is suitable for men and women and the tube that contains the product is gender neutral."
1544,1,Great soap_This soap lathers well and smells great. One of my biggest annoyances with bar soap is when I put it on my loofah and the later runs out halfway through washing my body. I never have that issue with this soap. I would buy it again!
5837,1,"Beautiful._This mascara makes your lashes thick and long and doesn't seem to flake off or smudge during the day.  I have noticed a bit of clumping on the lashes that I have to smooth out, but that's what you get with mascaras that make thin lashes look very thick.  Other than that, it is a perfect mascara! ."
6667,1,"Another great moisturizer from ORS (Organic Root Stimulator)_I purchased this item along with the other companion items from the ORS HAIRepair line. First off this creme smells so good. The consistency is super rich and thick but absorbs well into my hair strands. This creme doesnt feel heavy or weigh my hair down. There are some great ingredients in this cream such as coconut oil, avocado oil, green tea & olive fruit oil to name a few all of which are very beneficial to maintaning healthy growing hair. Another hit and a repurchase for me."
2208,1,Must Have_This topcoat is perfect for all manicures and pedicures it leaves your nails looking very shiny and it dries very quickly I would definitely recommend it.
3747,1,"Great highlighter+bronzer_I have a pale and dull complexion, so I tried various bronzers/highlighters from more expensive brands thinking they'd give me the perfect glow, but instead made me look orange or way too shimmery. I finally tried the Physician's Formula shimmer strips, and I love it. It's not too orange or shimmery, just a natural, subtle glow. I think it looks great on different skin types, some of my friends tried it (both with darker complexions) and it made their skin glow as well. I like that it can also be used as eyeshadow."
8233,1,"They like Axe better_Dove is a brand with a feminine reputation, but it has become more common for guys to use and is often recommended to both genders by doctors for people with dry or sensitive skin.  That is what the Dove+ line is about. The bar soap adds a gritty texture and musky scent, and this Clean Defense body wash takes a similar approach. Unlike the creamy standard Dove body wash, it is a gel. I think it cleans well and the smell is nice and not irritating, but the standard kind (Sensitive Skin, Visible Toning, etc.) leaves my skin a little less dry"
4163,1,"Neat_I think this stuff is pretty neat.  My boyfriend gets pretty amazed at how it comes out white and the beads break when you are putting it on to match your skin tone.  Could be a little darker though, not quite a medium tone makeup."
8064,1,Sizes made for...._I personally need volume on the black of my head. NOT the TOP of my head. Of course the bigger one looks awkward on the TOP of your head!
9563,1,"Axe rules_I have used other Axe products, such as Apollo, but I like Peace better. I am not thrilled with the pepper fragrance. I really like the citrus, sandalwood, ginger combination. The gel lathers great and it has a fresh, clean smell. It leaves a nice hint of fragrance on your skin but isn't overpowering. I love Axe products."
6510,1,"WORKS SO WELL but doesn't smell great_This product works better than other dry shampoos I have tried.  It makes it look cleaner and flufflier, gives it body.  The instructions even say that you could use on clean hair to give it some body which I can understand.  HOWEVER, it has a smell that I do not like so I would never put it on clean hair!"
5478,1,Good value for your money_A little goes a LOOOOOOOOOOOONG way with these things. I actually recommend getting the 5-pack (I think it's five) palette with the lightest colors to contour the tops of the cheekbones. I do that almost every time and it looks great. Very pigmented.
8316,1,"serviceable and economical_I really like Suave's products, particularly their conditioners. They are cheap, lighter and thinner than other brands, and the scents generally aren't too oppressive. I have very long, thick hair and need a lot of product and it has to be distributed evenly throughout my hair. Thicker conditioners are harder to apply and more expensive. I often choose Suave because it suits someone with my hairstyle and wallet.That being said, while this conditioner has all of the positive points I mentioned in the previous paragraph, it does not do a lot to create shiny hair, especially if you're older and your hair has a tendency to look dull. It works best as a creme rinse that makes combing hair easier and it makes it feel softer. If you want something that makes your hair shiny, I'd suggest rotating a more expensive conditioner into your routine and using Suave intermittently. I don't have children, but I think this would work great for their hair since kids generally have better quality hair than adults and ease of comb out is a stronger concern."
7646,0,"Too BIG!!_Im verrrry disappointed in this product.  They are so very beautiful and came as advertised.  All 60 pieces were there BUT the flowers are too big to put on my nails.  The are 3 dimensional and almost the size of a dime.  They dont curve in the back and I like my embellishments to be completely flat on my nails unfortunately these were too big and only a little piece on the back was touching my nail.  Unless you have ginormous nails that are like 2 inches wide, I would not recommend these for nail design.  They are very pretty so I will probably end up using them on other craft projects but I really wanted these for my nails."
8172,0,"They changed the brush_I've been buying IBD for a long time and love the product!  For some reason the company has changed some of the brushes on them, I'm assuming some of the newer ones maybe.  The white cap that the brush is attached to, is bigger or wider, and those brushes are terrible.  The brush is much more bristly or hard so when you try to apply the polish is doesn't go on smooth.  It leaves it streaky and uneven.  I hated it so much that I took another color similar to it and wiped it off and then used the good brush to apply it, but then had to wipe it off when I was done.  The polish itself is still good, just a terrible brush!!!!  I have another color that is the same way."
2702,1,Oh yeah_Everyone knows how Vaseline works. Got a great deal. Pack of 3 for $14 buck. How awesome is that???? Purchase this product people.
960,1,"The Last Clippers I'll Need, I Think_I've had many clippers over the years, but none as good as these.  They cut cleanly and easily.  I just have to find a place to hide them so my kids don't walk away with them."
8613,1,"Nice Lightweight Daily Conditioner!_I like this Nexxus Salon Hair Care Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner!  It's marketed as a lightweight nourishment for age affected hair to preserve volume and rebuild vibrancy and vitality.  It comes in a 13.5 fluid ounce lavender bottle.The directions say to apply to damp hair and comb through with a wide tooth comb, and leave it in for 3 minutes, then rinse with warm water.My first impression was of a nice, light fragrance that reminds me of a floral/coconut/cotton candy cane mix.  Going on, this conditioner is definitely light and it doesn't take much to cover my head - about a tablespoon.  It actually detangled my hair and rinsed easily.My hair looks great afterwards.  I will definitely buy this conditioner again."
3154,1,"Really love this brand! Works!_All of the Village Naturals Bath Soaks I've used have done what they claim to do. They have a lot of aromatic quality for even a small amount of salts. I don't use very much in any given bath and I still get a nice aromatic experience through my entire bath, not just at the beginning. The scents are great. I would use the scents for more than just baths if they were available in for example, room spray or candles. These actually encourage me to take a bath to relax, even though I'm not a bath person, because of how much I like the aroma. They dissolve really well- you won't be sitting on a bunch of rock salt when you're trying to relax. I'm a generally high strung, stressed out person- both because of personality and what I have going on. I have tried so many various teas, oils, and natural vitamin drops in an attempt to get relief from something other than prescription drugs and seriously, I feel way more relaxed after using these salts. Could be actually related to some sort of stress hormone interaction with the molecules of the scents, or could just be a great placebo from relaxing in a bath with a scent I actually love. Either way- works best for me to relax. I highly recommend these. They'd make a great gift too! Especially for someone going through a tough time, a student headed toward finals in school, or someone with a high demand job. The scent is pretty universal, seems like most people would like it."
3201,1,"good for acne_Seems to help kill skin bacteria. Also good for cuts. Has a nice clean smell. The first time I used it I could practically feel bacteria dying on my skin or something. Fairly natural.I use a D'arsonval device first, then this, to try to help with acne."
5545,1,"Perfect_This is the best purple I have ever used. It has a tone of vibrancy that is hard to accomplish in just one dye, and in no way was I disappointed. I have only used half a jar, and I still haven't had to re-dye it after 4 1/2 weeks already."
8429,1,"nice_I bought it for my mother and she loved it, since we couldn't by the NAKED one 'cause it was over. The price is really nice and the colors too. She wore it for the first time and the glittered brown that she picked in the last line (third color, last line) was really coll in her eyes. But, the second color, in the second line, was a bit problem, it didn't appeared so much. I think it would last a little longer, because less than one hour later, we were living and the eyeshadows looked like if she was wearing it all they long. Maybe it would be better if she had putted a foundation, a BB cream or a primer, because I gave it to her in the same day and she wanted do were it right way, so didn't put anything else on her face."
3924,0,Not Good_This cream is awful and I do not like its consistency or the way it smells. I will never purchase it again.
5492,1,"Takes a little while to get used to it, but works great!_You need a little practice to get used to it, but I love it. I have long, fine hair and I bought the styler hoping to get some volume into my hair.Volume wise, not so much. Or maybe I'm not getting the techniques right. I've seen some youtube instructional videos, it seems to work for them. Maybe if you add a little product, it would work better. I just don't like putting stuff in my hair.But, it does give the soft, salon blown dry effect, unlike those of hair straighteners.On the down side: I followed the instructions and blow my hair to 80% dry before using it. But it still takes some time to get your hair styled."
5114,1,"Economical and Effective_Use the Mane N' Tail products routinely for my horses, and really like their economy and effectiveness.  Combined with their excellent detangler, this is a must-have trio for a horse-barn."
9821,1,Dark spots are vanishing!_This serum is the only thing that has done anything for my wrinkles and has worked well for me so far. It nicely absorbed into my skin not leaving it oily and for the price you can't beat it...will be purchasing more once I run out.
1626,0,"Not my cup of tea_It looks like I am the odd one out.  I did not like this lotion at all.  Everytime I wore it, the smell got to me after a couple of hours and I would get a nasty headache.  Perhaps I am sensitive to one of the chemicals?  I had to give it away to a friend-she says it's ok but not her favorite."
8363,1,I haven't used these yet but.._I haven't used these yet but I am very please with my purchase. Looks like decent quality. Arrived on time and for the price you can't beat it.
6179,1,"Amazing!_I am in LOVE with this palette! The colors are beautiful and very pigmented, I am very impressed with this product. Shipping was great, it came on the estimated delivery date and it was very safe in the box. No harm done to the shadows, everything was perfect and looks just like the picture! I will be coming back to this palette when it runs out, but 144 colors will last me a very long time :)"
2091,0,No results seen_I have used this for about a month.  So far I have not seen any noticeable results.  However I have noticed that my face has more acne like blemishes in the areas I have applied the cream.
6142,1,"Loved Everthing!_The stones were blinding! I loved this they came in a variety of sizes and shapes. There were so many! i was so excited. It took a little while for them to get to me, but it was totally worth the wait."
9495,1,"Perfectly acceptable 2 in 1_I have waist length hair and generally prefer a shampoo and conditioner.I use 2 in 1s when I'm in a rush because my hair will air dry quicker using them compared to using a shampoo and conditioner, and they are convenient. This one left my hair smooth and soft with no flyaways which can be an issue if it's not conditioned well.It smells fantastic, my teenage daughter loves it for her short, thick layers. It's just conditioning enough without weighing down the layers so she has lots of volume and body."
7307,1,"smells good, cleans well_I like the smell of the shampoo and it cleans well.  The sleek tall skinny bottle made it easy to fall if it's just put on a slippery surface, but it's tolerable.  I'll use it."
7060,1,"cute!_Just the perfect size for nails!  The crown part is plastic, but is shiny enough to please little girls.  It arrives in a timely mater, so is good for me."
6841,1,"Very nice product .._but again, a &#34;Medium&#34; that was too light for me.  From now on I get shades that go Medium to Deep."
8643,1,Works great._This is another good product by Clearasil. It does a great job of cleaning dirt and oil out of your pores. It really cleans your face andleaves it feeling very refreshed. It does dry your face out a little which is the only drawback.
2996,1,"My Friend has No Eyebrows_Interesting but true title. My friend shaved off her eyebrows and draws them in. They look great and she loves this pencil to make them. She is really amazing at doing makeup and you hardly notice her eyebrows are even different. I am not recommending you shave off your eyebrows today, buy this pencil, and it will draw on perfect eyebrows. I'm saying that if you DO decide to do this, this pencil works great."
7038,1,"a terrific, long-lasting moisturizer_To note, I received the wrong item at first (L'Oreal Age Perfect For Mature Skin BB Cream Instant Radiance) and my original review was for that. The correct item was sent so this is my updated review.This is one of the best drugstore moisturizers I've ever used, and I absolutely love it. The moisturizing effects have been terrific, and it exfoliates well without causing little pills or 'sloughing' of skin cells like several other moisturizers I've tried. I don't have a lot of wrinkles except around the eyes, which show mostly when I smile, and so far no difference with those. However, my upper lip has what I thought was 'smoker's wrinkles' when my mom developed them, but now I realize they were genetic, and this moisturizer has helped those tiny little fine-line wrinkles in the area. It's definitely firmer.The one age spot I seem to be getting on my face (up near my left eyebrow) hasn't shown any change, though I'm only on about week three and the box says it takes eight weeks before significant change is noted, so I'll try to come back and update. UPDATE: At eight weeks I do notice the spot has faded, in that I can't really find it anymore. It was already faint enough that makeup covered it without problem, but now even without makeup you can't see it.My skin after three weeks has already seen an improved uniformity of color overall after just 17 days of use -- lots of moisturizers promise this but this is the first that's ever actually delivered. The color does seem to improve mostly on days when I wear the moisturizer, so the bulk of the skin color improvement is a 'temporary' situation, but a slight improvement can be seen on days even when I don't wear it.And there ARE some days when I don't use this moisturizer and go with a lighter, different brand, because Age Perfect is pretty thick and it can be felt for hours after putting it on, so I don't use it if I'll be wearing makeup. That's the only real complaint I have, that it's too thick to wear under makeup because it takes so long to soak in, and makeup just slides right off.This tub has lasted quite a while, too. I've used it once a day (twice a day on the small age spot) for 17 days and it doesn't look like I've even started the jar. I definitely recommend giving this a try."
5182,1,Great brow wax_This wax keeps the hairs that won't lay down to lay down with this Brow shaper.  It is a bit waxy only because I apply it too thick but after I train them to stay in place then I won't have to use as much.  My eye brows do look better and will keep using it.
5002,1,"I'm kind of in love with this company and their stuff now..._All right so I'm an african american girl in my early 20s and had a lot of deep acne scars primarily on my jawline and right in the middle of my cheeks (I've seen this issue before; lot'sa people seem to have acne scarring there). Problem is, I had acne that would consistently occur there too, so if I even got the scars there to fade a little with whatever I used, I'd just get more scars later from more acne, ALL THE TIME.Because I'm not fond of going to dermatologists (mostly cause of money), I did my research and stumbled upon peels and in particular glycolic peels. Glycolic worked semi okay with discoloration from the scars but didn't help the breakouts. Low and behold this kind of peel!This peel, after using it once gave me more noticeable results than any other product I've ever used. For about $24 dollars, you get something that really works and can easily last you 2 months. I've used it for about two, two and a half months now (lost a few weeks when I ran out of funds) and do it once a week. It really dries up existing acne AND peels off discolored skin.As a college kid I really don't have that much extra money but this is worth every penny as a long lasting vanity item that actually helps. Not only is it making my skin near flawless, if I happen to get a zit now I can spot treat it, and it's basically gone the next day, and will peel off most of the discoloration from the blemish a few days later.I seriously have an addiction to foundation because my skin was so blotchy and acne ridden but now I'm seriously considering not even wearing makeup. This stuff is that good. I would recommend this to anyone with trouble with acne AND scaring in the same location, or just acne, or just scarring! In my experience its definitely worked for these problems.My only other word of advice is, if you've never used a peel before, PLEASE research it and be careful. Spot test, don't leave it on for too long (2 minutes is plenty for your first peel) and moisturize really well afterwards. Do it on a day where you know you wont be seen much for the next 2 or 3 days because you will peel. For those used to glycolic peels I'll just mention that I peeled a good bit more with this than glycolic too (which is a plus in my opinion!)."
4898,1,"LOVE IT_greates ever1 this is the only one thing that works on hard elbows and hills skin!!! no smell at all! very absorbent! bht is the only one thing i do not like about this lotion, but bht is in the food...so guess it is ok"
8150,1,Midnight Swim_What an awesome deep blue color.  I can't wait to play with this color this winter.  Great with CND additives.  Love it.
5253,0,"Voluminous Mascara_My sister first recommended this mascara to me years ago and I used to like it but the last couple I've used flaked everywhere and ended all over my face....what's happened to this product???? Leave well enough alone and if it's not broke, don't fix it!!!!"
8960,1,"Pleasant Fragrance_Nicely fragranced, not too floral, perfumed or sweet.Lathers well, even in our very hard water.A little bathing luxury that leaves skin smooth and refreshed, gently cleansing and a good value.Fragrance is pleasant while bathing and barely noticeable once skin is dry, so there's no competing with perfumes."
2742,1,"Best option for my hair_I have coarse, thick, and wavy/curly hair. I have used serums and oils, but they make my hair extremely oily at the end of the day. But this smoothing spray is a perfect medium. It keeps my hair shiny without being oily. I use it in the morning, leave it on my hair for about 10 minutes, then blow dry with a round brush. I finish it with a ceramic straightener."
861,1,"Such a wonderful scent_I'm a collector of colognes and this is one of my favorites.It's a light, clean, fresh scent.  The initial spray is a chorus of citrus and the dry down is very nice too.  It's suitable to wear anywhere."
7747,1,Good product_My wife uses this product and gave me her review.The smell is very pleasant to her.  As advertised no greasy feel or mess.  Not using long but seems to be providing the moisturizing that was expected.  Will have to wait to judge longer term rejuvenating effects.
6566,1,"Excellent Files at an Excellent Price - Enough to Share_I've used the files before but they do break (left loose in makeup case in purse) and once the pieces are too short to use, it's time for a new file.  The hard box is nice for keeping them safe.  I received all of these files for about the price that I last paid for one.  The files don't snag or rip the nail.  They file the length down quite quickly so you need a light touch.  I gave one to my husband to try and he was impressed - that says a lot because, before using this, he thought a file was a file.  Will have extras to give to overnight guests."
9139,1,What a brush!_Love this brush and what a great deal! I switch between this and a beauty blender and both I have to say work amazing but I've been favoring this brush lately. Great for stippling and blending and it's really soft like those more expensive brushes.
8989,1,"skin aid_Bought after watching a dr. show. Seems to be working. I see a difference in fine lines, hope it continues"
8353,1,"Great After Gel!!!_Smells great and it works! No kid scent real clean feel for hours! I'll be getting more!! Surprised that Axe would make something for a grown man! They have my respect, now. This stuff is even better than Jack Blacks after Gel!!!"
8158,1,"Daughter approved!_This is an excellent product, Heats up fast and straightens the hair effortlessly. My Daughter gave it a try with wet hair and given a full thumbs up. She was all smiles and very happy with the product. She has beautiful hair and she keeps her hair neat and clean. This product helped her keeping her hair straight shinny and silky.What she liked about the product was how incredibly fast it heats up and in matter of seconds. The ceramic plates are coated to make the hair shiny and straight. The product quality is very good for the price and packaging is superb. Even the cord has pivoted contacts that makes the using of this product a breeze.The product delivers amazing results, well built and daughter approved. Full five stars!"
1673,1,"It's A 10 Miracle Leave In Product - My favorite after shower hair treatment_Have been using It's A 10 for a couple years now, and am very glad to be able to find it here on Amazon.  Was first introduced to this product by staff at the salon I go to; they said it would help color treatments last longer and would also make my hair feel smoother and less fragile after treatments. They were right and I like this stuff.Locally the four ounce container sells for eighteen bucks and the ten ounce bottle sells for thirty, plus five percent sales tax, if available. Getting better deals on Amazon, even with shipping included, makes my hair very happy.Like others have noted, a little bit of this product does go a long way and a four ounce bottle of it lasts me three or four months. My hair is fairly thick and runs about halfway down my back, and best results for me are when It's a 10 is applied while my hair is still damp.I like to spray It's A 10 on after shampooing and comb it totally through and down the entire length. Never gets snagged; it is an excellent detangler and I also find it to be a great frizz reducer once my hair does dry.  It's A 10 also makes my hair shine and feel very sexy & soft, which my husband likes very much too.If you are looking for a product like this for use like I described above, then I totally recommend that you give It's A 10 a try.Highly recommended."
6445,1,dark perfect pink_i love this colour good for night party its really nice perfect dark pink....if u want dark pink this is the 1
9366,1,"Amazing product_I have been using Uni Argan oil for almost a month now.  I absolutely love it!  This is by far the best brand I have used.  The oil absorbs quickly into my skin and hair.  I apply it to the ends of my hair and I have noticed  that my hair is so soft now and no more split ends.  Now that summer is here, I love to wear sandals, but I hate the dry feet I get.  I apply this Argan oil before bed on my feet and by the morning they are silky soft.  This also works great on your cuticles and as a massage oil.  The dropper is great for easy no mess application."
7285,1,"Not sure, but hopeful_This is expensive for its size. if you want the actual retin-a you can buy it from [...] for only a few dollars more and it works 8 weeks faster (this says it will take 12 weeks to see a difference).The packaging was good as far as protecting breakage but when it arrives the bottle is already ready for use when received (there is nothing to actually open). I didn't like that because it could have become contaminated while in the process of packing and shipping. The company should at least put a seal over the hole where the product comes out. Also, you should not try to twist off the top, you will break the jar since it does not twist off. The product itself, goes on well; it is not oily or too thick. It takes two full pumps to cover face and neck evenly. my face became itchy a little while after applying the product (but I'm using something else so it may have been that, I'll update you). Since I have just used this recently for the first time, I haven't seen a change in the appearance of my skin yet, but I will let you know if/when I do (or any other changes)."
2447,1,Pretty Good!!_The product shipped fast which was a big plus!! It wasn't bad but I would have liked for the waxing stick to be a little longer and bigger. I like the strips so this will take a litte time to get used to but its overall a good product.
1033,0,"Ok but it DOES contain formaldyhyde_Essie says this does not contain formaldehyde, but it does.  Base coat works ok but improperly decribed on Amazon.  Looking for a good one without the harsh and harmful chemicals."
6394,1,"Perfect for the crease_I use this everyday, this is the one brush I've found that works perfectly for applying colors to the crease. I also like the fact that even though the price of the brush was cheap, the quality is that of a more expensive brush."
1104,1,"Boyfriend loved it_Upon turning 21, something in me changed. I became tired of smelling like a teenager, drenched in the fruitiest smelling body-mist I could find. Enter Baby Phat Goddess by Kimora Lee Simmons. At first, I was partial to the scent, unable to decide whether to buy it or leaving it sitting on the store shelf in all of its beautiful glory. I caved and tossed it in the cart.The first time I smelled it outside of the store, I was still partial. I couldn't decide whether I liked it or not.When I arrived home, my boyfriend asked what I was wearing. While it wasn't the first time he noticed that I smelled nice, it was the first time he actually took an interest in knowing what it was. He loved it. He told me that it was feminine but subtle, certainly a more mature scent than my previous perfumes.I believe my indifference to the perfume was the fact that I was used to overly fruity scents (my favorite). However, I realized that it's certainly a more 'adult' perfume without the muskiness or overpowering scents of others.The product is perfect for both young women looking for a more 'grown-up' scent and older women looking for less of a 'grandma' smell. No offense.Also, most women don't realize that the faux diamonds around the neck of the bottle is actually a ring! Awesome!Boyfriend is now my husband, so the scent must have done something right. ;)"
8251,1,"Luxurious INDEED._I am not a person to spend a ton of money on beauty products because I don't wear makeup in the first place, so this was a total delight to try. The first thing I noticed when I applied it was it's thick, creamy, texture that went on my face smoothly as butter - but with none of the thickness that I noticed when it was on my finger - great, because it meant I had applied too much and it would last even longer than I had first imagined. It gives your face a silky, protective coating that makes you feel like a movie star! Best of all it absorbs right into the skin so you don't have the hideous cold cream and curlers look that is a husband's worst nightmare. LOLI have been using it for a few weeks now and can already see my face looking more youthful and refreshed when I wake up, and that is an insomniac's wildest dream come TRUE! I love this product so  much that I will consider buying it when I run out, which won't be for a WHILE now and that alone makes it worth it."
8146,1,"Great product that works fantastic!_When my daughter purchased this I thought it would be a waste, but when she had me try it I was extremely pleased!  It is very well made and does a great job!  After the first use, you will notice a huge difference in the feel of your skin.  Highly recommend this body brush!"
1471,0,Did not work_It didn't make my hair look horrible or anything which is why Im giving it 2 instead of one and it's cheap but .... It didn't make it shinier or 'richer' color. In fact I have brown hair with a good deal of red in it and I got this hoping to darken up my hair and even out red tones. It made my hair seem MORE red and even a bit lighter. My friend even commented it looked more red. It smells gross too.
9240,1,"Great Brushes._I recieved these brushes after about 3 days of shipping. (Mind you this is during the Holidays)Well they exceed my expectations by a trillion. They are full sized brushes.. Its a little hard to tell by the pictures. They are of great quality... I have Mac, Morphe, Sigma, Real Techniques, and all other brushes inbetween and besides the NO Name on them you would not be able to tell they werent name brand. They dont smell or shed.I do wish that the flat top was a little more dense but I am super picky! Its nothing that someone else may even notice.THESE ARE GREAT BRUSHES!!!!!I will update if they do not hold up."
9591,1,"Does the job._Lathers nicely, feels good. Only time will tell if it does all it is meant to do. The scent is very mild. Not gender-specific... could be used by anyone. We like it in our family. Will update how the hair feels after a month or so. Thanks for amazon for a chance to try it. We like Tresemme products."
821,1,"Light sweet fragrance for strong men!_Whether your man is old, young, athletic or an arm chair observer, this is a great day time fragrance - light enough.  It is also very nice in the evening as well.  It does not turn, it remains true."
9668,1,"Gorgeous color!_I LOVE this shade! And unlike many other CND Shellacs I've purchased in the past, it has a better opacity after only 2 coats. It's so pretty, I get tons of compliments when I wear it."
160,1,"Non-irritating to my sensitive skin_I have been using this for a few weeks now.  I'm not noticing too much in the &#34;firming&#34; department yet, however I like the cream a lot.  I have very sensitive skin and this does not bother or irritate it at all.  The smell is pleasant and the cream goes on smooth.  I wake up &#34;fresh-faced&#34; without an oily sheen as I've expreienced using other night creams.  I'll keep watching on the &#34;firming&#34;, but I will definitely purchase this again."
9937,1,"Leaves hair soft and vibrant!_This conditioner has a mild flowery perfume scent and squeezes out of the bottle easily.After I washed with the Dead Sea mud shampoo, I used the Dead Sea salt conditioner. I let the conditioner sit in my hair for a few minutes before rinsing it out. I noticed that my hair felt soft and silky. I love that feeling! When my hair dried, my hair looked so healthy and vibrant. My hair was also still very soft. This conditioner is wonderful!"
6255,0,"Made my sensitive skin itch_I bought this product along with the cleaner and serum and it took me a few weeks to realize (but I did) that it was the cause of my face feeling itchy for days and days. As soon as I switched back to my regular brand of moisturizer, the itching stopped. I have sensitive skin and should've known better than to try it."
8392,1,bright colors! so many!_they have so many colors to choose from and they're so easy to place on your nails. makes the hardest designs easier.
4685,1,"Remington S5500 Digital Anti Static 1 Inch Ceramic Hair Straightener_Great flat iron, i use it every other day. Arrived before time and you can't beat Amazon's price.  The flat iron heats up very quickly and is extreamly easy to use.  I have recommended this to all of my friends and no one has been disappointed yet."

1769,0,"cakey_The consistency makes it hard to apply evenly,  you have to really rub it in to make it look decent enough."
3812,1,"Second time order, second time PERFECT!_I order this palette for second time. Now its a present for my aunt. Second time it comes all perfect, perfect time of delivery and in perfect shape. Thank you."
6529,1,Best eyeshadow palette ever!!!_I love this eyeshadow palette!!! i use it everyday!! i love how it has bright colors for special occasions but also colors that you can use everyday. Once i get more familiar with using and mixing my colors i will definitely buy the other one that has all the bright colors!!! Love it!!!
5554,1,"Great little purchase!_Love this eyelash curler! At first, I wasn't sure what to expect. But, I've had it for awhile now and it has held up nicely. It's sturdy and works well. My eyelashes hold the curl all day."
411,1,works well_my eyelashes don't come off or move until I take them off at the end of the day. duo is good quality and dries clear.
5848,0,"Finulite - The End to Cellulite, AM/PM Cellulite Cream (2 - 4 oz bottles)_Too many products fot cellulite I was expecting at least better results, the bottles are to small I think should try other products."
2265,1,"Surprised on how good the scent was and the texture of the product_* Queen Helene Olive Oil Masque: Surprised on how good the scent was and the texture of the product* I am glad I tried it as it did sooth, soften and hydrate my skin* A great find for the price!"
9780,1,If it works_Not sure how one knows if a product is really hydrating. I hope it is since this past winter season has been brutal. I like Irish Spring's fresh scent.
9482,1,The Best Under Eye Cream I have Ever used_I have under eye circles and puffiness. I have tried every home remedy and product out there. MezmerEyes worked instantly for me! The Cream arrived beautifully packaged and was a generous size. The Cream is rich and a little goes a long way. My Eyes felt instantly hydrated. I apply the cream 2 times per day and have no problem wearing it under my make up. I have only been using the product for 3 days and already I have noticed a significant change in the appearance of my dark circles and bags. I highly recommend this product! This is honestly the best product I have ever used for my eyes.
8681,1,"Shiny, no flyaways, I love this system._I've had good experiences with Tresemme products, this is no exception.Used with the conditioner and serum, this system works to leave hair smooth and moisturized while still having body and bounce. My hair is fine and straight and shows build-up by looking limp and lackluster. After a couple of weeks of using this, my hair is the sleek, smooth curtain that I like. No fly-aways, and it's very shiny.The final step in this system is the serum. This is just wonderful stuff. The shampoo cleans my hair without stripping it, the conditioner works well against the dryness that makes it less smooth looking, this serum keeps flyaways gone. If you're just going with a natural style, it only takes a small amount rubbed between your palms and applied to the length of your hair with a little extra for the ends if necessary. If you're doing a very sleek hair style like a chignon, a little more helps to style it and keep it super smooth. It makes my hair just shine with a healthy look."
6000,1,Lashes_These lashes are exactly like the picture shows!!! The only problem I had is that it didn't get shipped the day it said it was. Overall I love them and can't wait to put them!! I recommend this product!!!
6487,1,"Nice_I am always on the lookout for a great facial cleanser.  I have pretty picky skin and so it is a bit difficult to find a product that I love and that loves my face.  I wasn't sure what to expect with the mixed reviews on this product, but was willing to give it a shot.The first thing that I noticed was the texture of the the facial wash gel.  It was not unpleasant at all and reminded me of the consistency of shampoo.  It was not slimy at all but basically a thicker gel.  I do want to stress that a little goes a long way - which is a huge plus, especially for budget conscience buyers.  The scent was fine - nothing to really stand out or take away from the overall opinion of the product.  It has a light clean type of scent that sensitive noses should not have a problem with.  The cleaning action of the Simple Refreshing gel was basic and nothing to shout from rooftops about.  What I did notice that was a huge plus for me was the fact that after using the wash, my face did not have that dry/tight feeling that it often has after many different types of cleansers.  It was a clean feeling.  Also, there was not sticky residue or any type of undesirable feeling to my skin after using it.Overall, Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel is a pleasant enough product.  I tend to love washes that make my pores feel as though they are 'breathing', which this one did not, however the clean feeling that it did leave my face was nice.  I would recommend this facial wash to anyone who has very sensitive skin and wants a gentle cleanser.  I did want to mention, as well, that I noticed my skin feeling smoother and softer after the very first use - which I loved.  Will I purchase this product in the future?  I am leaning toward yes and for the price am happy with it."
9767,1,"Love these brushes!_! am so glad to have a good quality set brushes for my own (my daughter always steals mine, but the case will keep them out if sight). The brushes are soft and do not apply powders too heavily.  Gor-geous!"
8098,1,"banana boat protect and hydrate_I don't think it smells like bananas or sun screen, I think it smells like a light lotion. It is a full spectrum protection spf 30 with aloe and antioxidants. It is the perfect every day moisturizer and sun protection. It does absorb quickly and fully and my 60 yr old skin feels smooth and soft. Can't beat it and the price is right."
3125,1,This works!_I purchased the nose clip four months ago and I am impressed with the results so far.  I had been using it consistently for about 3 months and the shape of my nose improved a lot.  My nose was round and wider than I would have liked but with using the clip it has a better shape to it. It works!
1458,1,"One of the best scents ever!_Curious was not one of my most favorite perfumes ever, but In Control surprised me! Similar looking bottle and other stuff, but completely different smell. This is mature, yummy, and just plain old delicious. I love it!"
3919,1,"Iridescent, creamy, left a healthy glow..._I bought this on a lark, as there was a tester available at the store. I had expected it to be more pigmented (as the 'natural' color is from NYX), but it goes on lighter and found that it left a nice sheen. It is definitely more of a peachy-coral color, but works well on my light-medium skin. I think this would be a great color when you have a bit of a tan or when using bronzer."
3866,1,"very pleased_Just bought six more for stocking stuffers after trying this one out. The guy at the mall started me off with the idea, but I wouldn't let him work on my nails because who knows who had just been worked on previously! I have had these before (different mall kiosk experience 20 years ago!) and they did last a long time. When my daughter told me she was still using her old one, I thought it was time for a new one.One thing: since no instructions are included it is important to note that you should not overly buff (longer than about 20 seconds) on the darkest side as you can make your nails too thin thereby defeating the whole purpose! But you can use the white side to your hearts desire, that's the one that really brings out the shine, anyway.Very fast shipping. And for some reason I received a 30 cent promotion?These are definitely a bargain.I also use these on my toenails on the month or so a year that I give them a rest from pedicures. I do not like manicures, so this is a way to make my nails look finished with no actual polish."
9025,1,So pretty_This is a sand polish its very sparkely on and its very similar to OPI Liquid sand Jinx. I have both and they are almost identical
3942,1,"Prompt Shipping & Wonderful Product!_I bought this yesterday, yes YESTERDAY and it was waiting for me at my door when I got home from work! Nice surprise! The box was well packed and my pallet made it to me completely unharmed. All the shadows are in wonderful condition and the color payoff is fantastic! I've been wanting this pallet for a long time now and decided to pull the trigger. Very glad I did. It's perfect for neutral looks as well as outlandish fun looks! I'm very excited!"
7244,0,"ONE MONTH and NO Lightening_I left this soap on a MINIMUM of 15 minutes EVERY night.It could be good for clearing up acne, but you need to leave it on a minimum of 15 minutes.The bar will last longer if you leave it in a sealed plastic container.It is not ordinary soap, so don't use it just for washing.Put it on your face and neck, be careful of your eyes and then go and read or watch TV for 15 minutes and then use a moisurizer.It did not lighten my skin in any way, shape or form.It dries your skin out (exfoliates) and that's it."
9658,1,"VERY strong fragrance compared to night cream and microsculpting_I love that this has SPF and it's light enough to use during the day.  However, the strong fragrance keeps me from using it as often as I'd like.  I've been using the Olay night cream and the Olay microsculpting cream, so I wasn't expecting Olay total effects to be much different in scent.  I'm generally not sensitive to a lot of odors, but this scent is pretty strong...thankfully the scent dissipates after 20 minutes or so.The dispenser pump is pretty good so you don't go overboard with how much you apply.  I've not noticed much of a difference in my skin since using this, but I've mostly just used this under makeup or alone when I go out during the day for the SPF feature.  It is a decent moisturizer, but it will not serve as a replacement for my night cream."
60,0,"Great color, washes out in 3-4 weeks, loaded with chemicals_The R57 is such a lush red color. It looks a bit darker than what's on the box (more like the color at her roots), but that may be because my hair has been previously bleached. I still like it, its even better looking than the box! Before using the Loreal Feria, I had tried the Garnier Olia, which ruined my hair. Olia is crap in a box-it will fry your hair like nobody's business, and the color lasts exactly three shampoos. Anyway, I purchased the Feria to try and cover over the damaged and faded Olia. The Feria did a great job, coloring my multi-shaded and faded hair a deep, uniform auburn color with highlights here and there. I also add jojoba to my conditioner, which is excellent for dry, damaged hair. It has lasted longer than any red box dye, and even longer than some salon colors. In the directions, it says to shampoo hair twice when rinsing out the red dye-I didn't do that. I just rinsed it. This color will continue to bleed down the drain and onto your towels, as any red dye does, but it just has a staying power that most reds don't have. Always use cool water, as cold as you can tolerate, on your red hair.I am trying to find a more natural red henna dye, and tried one from Mendahi on a sample of my hair, but have had no luck with that. I used only one box, and my hair is fine, dry, and to the bottom of my shoulder blades. I also don't use shampoo. Once or twice a week, I dissolve a tablespoon of baking soda in a cup of tepid water (make very sure it's dissolved, or you will end up with white granules remaining in your dried hair!). I wet my hair in the shower, pour this into my roots, massage, rinse, and condition with 100% pure coconut conditioner mixed with jojoba oil. The first time you sub the baking soda for shampoo, you might not love the results. Just try it once or twice more; I did, and my roots are silky soft and very clean. It's also been kinder to my red color, which has the largest dye molecule, making it the most difficult color to maintain.UPDATE! Please use henna instead of chemical haircolor, it's such a better option!My hair is overprocessed, I have been bleaching it for years and had dyed it red with a box dye a few months ago (loreal r57 cherry crush).  My hair was breaking, falling out like crazy and I am trying to eliminate chemicals from all of my beauty products, and typical box hair dye is overloaded with nasty toxins.I was afraid to try henna, because people will tell you that your hair will turn orange-its not true! Henna has saved my hair and I have never received so many complements! I ordered the burgandy 100 gram from HENNA GUYS, they have a website and sell here on amazon, and it provided me with two applications (my hair is past my shoulder blades).  I mixed half of the package with water and a plastic spoon (no metal!), put it in an empty jumbo hair dye applicator bottle from Sallys, and applied it. It was so easy! It's not even messy, just make sure you have a damp washcloth handy to wipe up spills on your face or sink immediately.  I saturated my hair, wrapped my head up in saran wrap, and went to sleep. I left it in for 11 hours, then washed it out and conditioned it.  When it was dry, it had a bit of a brown orange tone, so I prepared the remaining mix, added a raw egg, and reapplied it on my hair.  I left it on for five hours, heated it with a blow dryer for about five minutes, then washed it out.  Remember that henna takes two days to fully develop, so be patient.  It looked good when I washed and dried it, but WOW, it looked even better two days later! It has a gorgeous deep burgandy tone, its shiny and soft, and I have not had a bad hair day since! My scalp does not itch like it does after using chemical dyes, and it looks so rich and healthy! I am so in love with henna, I just can even describe the difference that it has made!  I will forever be faithful to this henna brand! Customer service is so helpful, and will respond quickly to any questions about the product.  Henna is addictive! I am trying the blend of burgandy and deep red next! Love it! Remember that if you aren't getting the deepness of color you want, or it looks orange, henna it again and again until you achieve the color you want! Also, if your hair has been bleached in the past, as mine has, it does take more reapplications to keep the color.  It's just something you have to live with until the bleached portion of your hair grows out and you can cut it off.  Henna is excellent for controlling oily scalp, which was not a problem of mine, but would be very beneficial for some people.  I didn't have any problem with the smell that some people comment about, and even though I left it on for over 11 hours, I did not get a headache.*I have added a picture of my hair with the Feria.  You can find it on the main product page, scroll way down toward the bottom and you will see it on the right. I did not have my flash on, so it appears a bit darker than it actually was."

222,1,"No stickiness, no annoying flavor, and no chapped lips_I have tried many products in the lip balm category, and most of them have let me down. As a male, I don't care for the usually disgusting fruity varieties. All I want is something that moisturizes, protects, and relieves my lips without being distracting. The Neutrogena Norwegian Forumula Lip Moisturizer does all of the above. It feels very smooth and thin and you forget that you have it on. The SPF 15 is essential for anti-aging too. I recommend buying this lip moisturizer if you want great results without the distractions of the other brands."
9712,1,"Not greasy and moisturizes my skin!_I wasn't really sure this product would amount to much after being let down by so many other Vitamin C serums on the market. But given the affordable price, I decided to give it a try. Well...it's only been four days since I've started using it, but in short I am extremely happy with it. First, I love that it isn't watery thin like many other vitamin c serums, which can dry out my skin. It feels hydrating, but not oily or thick at all. But most important, it has given my skin a glow that I haven't seen in a very long time. Just a few drops in the morning (followed by my sunscreen) and then a few drops at nighthas made my skin look so bright and clear.The serum is crystal clear, which I believe is an indication that the vitamin C is stable and safe to use. To keep it from turning into a yellow/orange color (which indicates that the serum is no longer effective), I store mine under my sink with a cloth wrapped around it.So far, I'm super happy with this purchase and if it keeps performing as well as it has been, I will definitely be a repeat buyer!"
7531,0,not as expected_this color is so bright more for light complexion woman. if you like that bright chalk look this is perfect for you
946,1,Great shears_These shears are awesome.  I needed some shears to keep my ends clipped.  I am not a professional so i didnt need anything spectacular.  When i received them i was very satisfied because they cut very nicely and the gold handles are nicely done also.
165,1,"Great product._I got this as a gift for my father and he really likes it. it does a great job in cutting hair. Although, I would prefer that manufacturer will sell this item with fewer pieces for hair trimming. Very often 90% of them not needed.Bottom line is that I would definitely recommend this item to anybody!"
1418,0,Can't Tell the Difference..._Between this and Vaseline.  Guess that can be a good thing or a bad thing. My lips still dry out by morning so I don't like it.
1505,1,"***DON'T GET SCAMMED***_All genuine Dermalogica products have the following:1. Original grey box with barcode sticker sealing the lid of the box2. Silver stay-fresh seal on the opening of the tube, same as most seals on a new jar of peanut butter or medicine/vitamin bottle3.

Now I'm glad I did as I hope this info will help any ladies who are buying on amazon find the honest sellers and avoid the scammers.**Product Review**Fabulous!! This cleanser is amazing!!!"
3537,1,"BYE, BYE BROWN SPOTS!_I'm a garden lover, simply love to work in the yard.  The results of my flower beds aren't prize winners but that's beside the point - the pleasure is in planting and tending to them.  What is not a pleasure for me is wearing garden gloves.  Yes, I know better but don't wear them hence those unattractive brown sun spots on my hands.  Thought they were just something I'd have to live with until discovering Glytone Skin Bleaching Fading Lotion.With 2% hydroquinone this is an active bleach.  It has been about two weeks (I apply just once a day at bedtime) and those spots are actually disappearing.Glytone made the application very easy with a soft rollerball that dispenses a small amount of  liquid with the slightest touch.  Thus, I'm able to simply dab it onto the spot.Very pleased with this product.- Gail Cooke"
9906,1,"Really nice sponge_I had never used a natural sponge before, this works great!  I love that its compost-able.  I did have to soak it each day before I used it.  Check out my full review: [...]"
9651,1,"This oil was fantastic for my skin_I got this free to try. This can be used on your hair or skin and boy was this one good timing also.  Last week I used a deodorant I was very allergic too.  My underarms and the back of my arms broke out in a very dry and cracking rash.  I tried lotions and everything else I could think of, then this fantastic oil showed up.  I used it twice a day on my underarms and the back of my arms and after the first day could already tell a difference.  After about 3-4 days the dry spots were basically gone.  This was fantastic oil.  I am going to try on my legs next.  With the hot weather coming I am not going to have ashy legs this summer."
2611,1,"Great Spray Bottle_This is a great spray bottle.  It's the perfect size for traveling.  Great for taking along some of your favorite perfume in a smaller, easier to deal with container.  The nozzle doesn't get clogged either."
9508,1,"Works well; great scent_I&#8217;m very pleased with this shampoo. Unlike other dandruff shampoos it does not have a medicinal or chemical scent &#8211; just a nice shampoo scent that&#8217;s rather refreshing. It lathers very well, rinses clean and seems to be just as effective as other brands in controlling dandruff.Zero complaints about this. Suave is my preferred brand of shampoo since, regardless of the version or formulation, it provides good performance at a good price. This is no exception, and I would certainly recommend it."
4561,1,Playful_This is such a good scent.  I smell delicious!  I love the vanilla tones.  It's a great day wear and a good smell for being young and sweet.
317,1,"A beauty routine staple!_I love this product, unfortunately it's not always sold in every store. Thankfully i can get it from Amazon! It smells good and is not a harsh product. I plan to try the lavendar one when i'm done with this bottle."
2239,1,Excellent moisturizing without clogging pores!_This cream is very moisturizing without being greasy. It sinks in and keeps skin looking soft and supple. It does NOT break me out like most moisturizers or heavy night creams have in the past. The scent is very pleasant and it doesn't take a lot to do the job.Skin is looking much better after only 2 weeks of use!! You can also layer this under your makeup if your skin is very dry and it sinks in and doesn't affect foundation at all. Love the results!
4695,1,"Vivo Anti-aging eye serum_This is my very first time to try the Vivo Per Lei Anti Aging Eye Serum, so far I have no complaints and the other Vivo Per Lei proucts are super. I'll let you know on this as I use it for a while. Thanks again for carrying these on Amazon."
7847,0,"These Vitamins Are Ok But That's It_I read so many amazing reviews about this product. They had all these amazing before & after pics but I didn't feel that it did anything for my hair. If the vitamin doesn't show any results for either my hair or my nails within the first month, I don't waste my money buying it again. I am not expecting drastic results, of course that would be irrational & unrealistic, but I expect to feel that my body likes them and that my hair likes them even if it may take time to see drastic results. I am very sensitive when it comes to my body and I can feel when I eat something that it doesn't like or that doesn't agree with me. These vitamins were just ok. I didn't notice any noticeable hair or nail growth or anything like that so I won't buy it again."
4364,1,shea butter Ivory_Great product love it!! Have always ordered from halaleveryday. came inn well packaged. goes on well really natural. Came in alot will last me a long time. I mixed it with other oils i purchased from the same seller.will defitnetly buy from here again.
9946,1,"Great design and excellent packaging_The Friendly Swede not only makes great products, but they bundle them in useful and creative ways. Their sleeping mask bundle is no exception...The package comes with *two* sleep masks, so you don't have to feel guilty when someone looks like they'd be happy to take yours if you offered. The masks are foam-based and formed to fit your nose bridge and also to not interfere with your eyelids. I find them very comfortable, and they block out light completely. Another nice design touch is the twin straps for behind the head. They are both adjustable, so you can place and size the straps to where they fit you best (not whatever fit the &#34;one size fits all dummy&#34;).The masks are great on their own, but the packaging makes it even better. They include six ear plugs (which I can't sleep without any more) along with a travel pouch that keeps everything in one place. I usually end up having to dig around for my ear plugs depending on where they ended up in my luggage. No more...These eye masks will come in very handy in about six weeks when I have an overnight flight coming up. Even outside of travel, I'm still liking the fit and feel if I use these to sleep in a room that's not dark.Disclosure:Obtained From: RetailerPayment: Free"
8320,1,"Great volume. No residue or chemical scent._I am a total fan of Suave shampoo. I've found lots of shampoos that leave a buildup of residue in my hair. Eww. Not so with Suave, and my hair has a nice, fluffy volume as a result. It has lots of lather and rinses out nicely, and there's that nice squeaky clean feeling at the end of the rinse.I have to think Suave put this shampoo out for review because of the scent. Well, that's the one aspect of this shampoo that I don't love. Fresh? No. Rainforest? Uh uh. Long-lasting? Not so much. (When asked how it smelled while my hair was still wet the response was 'Hmm, smells nice.' But 7 hours later it was more like 'I don't smell anything.') It's not a horrible scent, but it's not very appealing either. I think I'll try a different scent next time.The shampoo comes out in a gelatinous and that makes it easy to measure out how much you want and does not leave a mess on the lid. You could leave the bottle upside down, but I think I'd wait to do that until it's at least half empty, as the top is not that big and it could tip over when it's full and heavy.I have frizzy, curly, medium-length hair. I always spray on a detangler after washing my hair, whatever shampoo I use.The above was from Mrs. JS.I would only add, as a typically shampoo-clueless male, I agree with squeeky-clean no residue description. As for the 'Rain Forest Scent', I say it is a very faint Pine scent. I like it, as long as it doesn't remind you too much of Pine Sol."
6191,1,love it_what can I say well got it one day early and def love the colors I got noting broken and so glad I dirent get that dark green first color I wasn't liking that one but instead I got really pretty colors n glitters and some are scented witch I thought was cool and got 4 files yep im happy :)
8905,1,"Nice_This green appears to be more of a sea foam green, I would say has a blue undertone and a creme be a creme color."
3654,1,"Love it!_This stuff is the best! Whenever I get a couple of breakouts I use this as a spot treatment and then half way through the day they're almost completely gone or have diminished in size a considerable amount. It seems to work best for me when I pop them first and then put the tea tree oil on directly after. But yeah definitely ordering another one when this one runs out, it's really worth the price."
1108,1,I Love It!_Pure cold pressed Argan oil. Josie Maran is selling what she is calling Argan oil in a smaller bottle and is charging $50 for it. I use it on my hair and skin. It's worth the price and AAA Shea Butter is a seller I trust.
2125,1,"Love this line!_I can not say enough about the 40 carrots line.  I just love there products.  I use this, the Vit C gel, the eye gel, the cleanser, the sleep cream and they scrub and regular wash.  Love the smell, love how it makes my face feel.  Just wonderful!"
6282,1,"Great for coarse curly hair_I just tried this several months ago on my thick, 3c/4a hair. I LOVE IT. Especially the price. It runs around six or seven bucks in chain drugstores so look for the best price. It gives very good slip so I can comb through those wet curls easily. It isn't super thick but it isn't runny either. Smells good, not flowery but like a lotion. I use it for co-washing and regular conditioning. I have also mixed a bit of this with water in a spray bottle and used as a leave in conditioner with no adverse effects. For the price, it does what I need and I don't have to use half a bottle to do it.  On the same level of conditioning as TreSemme Naturals, Trader Joe's or Giovanni moisturizing conditioners, which all are staples in my regimen."
4672,1,"Eyebrows_I use this for my eyebrows. It causes my eyebrow makeup to stay put all day long. Too much on may cause you to itch, but once you got the right amount adjusted, you will not know you have it on. I only tried on lipstick once, and it works there too, but I need it most for my eyebrows."
361,1,"Never live without it!!!_I have been using Philosophy for about a year now, I ran out of my Cleaner and tried another brand .... Never again I cant live with out my Philosophy Purity Made Simple One - Step Facial Cleaner it is worth every penny. Thank you Philosophy."
3429,1,"This is the best nail file I have ever used!_This is the best nail file for natural nails, period.  No snagging or peeling, in fact, your nail edges are as smooth as glass!"
4143,1,Love these brushes!_Another great SHANY brush set...all of them are FANTASTIC fyi. These are baby soft and do not shed at all. The results you will achieve are amazing! Def professional quality.
971,1,"Affordable at-home spa treatment!_I love this product.  I bought it based upon reviews, and it's been great.  I've been using it twice a week for about a month now.  My skin is relatively clear, with the occasional blemish, but I did have some redness/scarring from previous bouts with cystic acne.  However, after a month of using this twice a day, my skin is glowing from the inside out.  My skin tone appears to be evening out, and I have no need for make-up if I don't want to wear it.  It's easy to use, first the crystals for about a minute, then the activator serum until it's thick and lathered.  Then I use a warm wet washcloth to remove it, and my skin is perfect underneath it.  The package says it supplies enough for 8 applications, and I would definitely say that's true.  You can feel free to use a little more of the crystals than the serum, as they definitely provide a little more of them.  It's not a miracle worker, but you will get results, and you'll get them fast."
6185,1,"Great buy_I was originally looking to buy another color, but this one caught my eye and I couldn't resist.  It's a nice neutral color with a LOT of shimmer to it.  Great for a night time look that isn't too in your face.  It stays all day and would compliment any skin tone.  It's a great buy and the product should last a few months!"
8647,1,"It works_well for protecting my ends. After washing my hair I towel dry and apply it to the ends of all my layers. I let my hair dry to about 75% dry then use my Ibiza round brush (AMAZING BRUSH btw) to make my beachy waves. It protects my ends well. One time only did I frazzle an small area of my ends, but it was my fault as I kept my hair in the brush and the dryer on it for too long. All you need is a little and the price is great. Stopped using my Kenra spray in thermal tx as this is better IMO."
2215,1,Amazing_This top coat dries my nail polish fast and gives it a brilliant shine. It looks like I went to a professional manicurist when I did it by myself at home. Highly recommend.
3878,1,"Best skincare....._It's My favorite skin care...Skincare LdeL Cosmetics Retinol Night Cream, 1.7-Ounce Jar....has sunscreen and is not sticky like some others."
4524,1,"Modern and Chic!_It goes on smoothly and looks amazing with 2 or 1 coat. I love this polish, it's the perfect shade and I think it would look great on many different skin tones. Essie is a brand known for its glossy finish and this one did not disappoint. Very beautiful polish!"
6017,1,"Great Value/Quality_I am a teenager who purchased it for myself. The selection of colors is great and you receive all the colors that are shown in 4 packages of six. Delivered in under a week after the order was placed. The quality was great of all the polishes although if the base coat is COMPLETELY DRY it will remove it when you put the crackle on. it crackles well also. I've seen complaints about the names of the polishes and the names come from the 2012 theme of the world ending. The designer/manufacturer is just going with a theme, so it's okay for children to use. The removers are flower scented, not fruit, and they contain a cuticle oil that helps your nails so it's a plus! WELL WORTH THE PRICE."
8828,1,Loving Seventh Generation_Good price and just as good as the pharmacy store brands but it's no chlorine.I will definitely order these again if the price is still good.
7477,1,"Amazing multi-use product_I hesitated ordering this product, but since I often use similar products and conditioners for ethnic hair (I love the Motion leave-in and deep conditioner) I wanted to try it. After a good look at the ingredient list, I've used in in a number of ways, with very good results.  First, it has a pleasant scent, lightly tropical-ish. I gave a friend a manicure, and used it as the cuticle softener. I put it on his soaked nails, used the wet pusher tool to clean and scrape, and then used a damp towel to remove. Then applied a bit on the clean nail and rubbed in as a conditioner. Perfect!I've used in on the very dry ends of my hair, it keeps them from being fly-away. I even rubbed it on my dry feet, put white socks on for a few hours, and boy, I feel like I've just had a spa pedicure!After a shampoo and condition, I put a SMALL amount all through to seal the moisture in. Pretty pleased, just wish it wasn't mainly a petroleum based product."
6058,1,Perfect_This was perfect for a 1st time user to the gelish uv nail polish experience.  Has everything a person needs.
2524,1,"Just what I was looking for_Love these and they are perfect for packaging my whipped shea butter. They don't leak (with thick custards... couldn't say for actual legit liquids). However, I have found a way to order them in mass for much cheaper per unit. Instead of nearly a dollar per unit I will buy them in mass from elsewhere for like 17 cents per unit. Sorry. I was having to charge so damn much for my products because these were just so pricey and I know it doesn't cost anywhere close to a dollar to make thee teeny jars. Only a few cents in actuality. But I do like this company. They send them fast and packaged very well."
1423,1,"Oooh_We both loved this stuff, even my husband likes bathing in it. He loves a bath after working in the cold for 12 hours a day, and this just smells yummy. It's also very moisturizing, so I love it myself. They say it doesn't put out as much bubbly, but let me tell ya, I'm sick and tired of washing out the bubbles-that-do-not-quit out of the tub! I'm very uneasy about any nondestructable thing, and there's something really fishy about a bathing product you can't kill. So I'm thinking when you get out, the other products we've been using are probably still on our skin. E[...]This Grapefruit/Bergamot, though, rinses off leaving soft and silky behind."
4079,1,"Creates Better Looking and Brighter Skin Around the Eye Area_Perfective Ceuticals Anti-Imperfection Eye Therapy with Growth Factor really works.  Applied nightly to the skin around your eyes, your skin appears less wrinkled and much brighter.  Sallowness and dark circles are minimized and everything looks better.  I highly recommend this cream for nightly use for anyone who'd like better skin around their eyes."
1684,1,great_Good quality for a bath brush. Plastic handle which I though would be wooden. No trouble with it in the shower so far.
2270,1,"great finish powder!_i got this a while ago and really loved it, but you can only tell the difference if you pay close attention to detail...which most girls who are into makeup do... i used this for a while up until i got the bare minerals for christmas, i love there finish powder even more!"
7859,1,Great way to stay organized_I love this product! I had been looking for ways to keep all of my Bundle Monster plates organized and now I have it! This is easy and convenient. I'm so glad I bought this!
2285,1,"Works fast!_I have only been using this for about 1 week and already many of my dark spots are gone and the others have substantially faded.  This product works fast!!  I don't know what ingredient causes it to work that fast, but I am happy with the results.  Thanks for an effective product."
2927,1,"wonderful formula_I have been sold on Hair One for a couple months now. I have been using the formula for colored hair, but decided to try the other formulas. This formula works as well as all the other formulas and has a really great cooling action on my scalp. It has Tea Tree Oil and does not leave my hair oily, but as light and full of volume as the other formulas. I am working very hard to grow my hair well past my sholders and my Hair Dresser commented the last time I received a trim regarding how healthy my hair has become since my last visit. Hair One is the only Shampoo Conditioner in my shower."
1692,1,"Great for giving dull, flat hair sheen-free boost_Firstly, this seemingly-costly product is actually more economical than cheaper alternatives I've tried, I'm still halfway through the can I bought almost a year ago (used 3-4 days a week)I have very straight hair that looks dull and falls volumeless & flat after showers, and sides grow perpendicular to my scalp.With this product, I can restore the tousled morning-after look by puffing my hair out at the top (where it tends to fall flat), straighten the sides, and raise the matte-factor for better tinge.What it does NOT do is make my hair shiny or hard/clammy (hair-gelled looking), thankfully.But you have to be very careful with the AMOUNT, less than a pea-sized piece, smoothed out into my palms and diluted with water is ideal for me to get all the desired effects (for 4-5''  long hair). If I accidentally use more than that, things will get clammy. I think that's the reason behind the negative reviews. This can be a disadvantage for some, as it demands careful adjustment unlike a spray, but it also makes this product extremely economical.Last but not the least, Dirt's exceptionally long lasting  (used in  the morning, it'll remain fairly effective after an active day & night out), and even after that, it wears out gradually and naturally.The smell is very slight and neither irritating nor pleasant."
3157,1,"Great product for Longtime Acne sufferers_I purchased this product in hopes it would help with my acne.  Although my acne is not severe, it is moderate and I have had it since I was 14 and I am now 34.  I have tried just about everything out there except accutane.  I have been on Retin A numerous times, antiobiotics, birth control, differin gel, tea tree oil, sulfur soaps, salicylic acid products, alpha hydroxy acid products and so much more.  I have FINALLY found the right product.  This product every other day along with Retin A Micro has been a God send for my face.  I am African American and have light skin, but I produce a lot of melanin and I always have hyperpigmentation after the blemishes heal.  I am noticing a HUGE difference with exfoliation and lightening of these scars with the products I listed above.  I found out about the product during a google search looking for acne solutions.  If you are like me and have tried everything, please give this a try it might be the product for you.  Also, I have always had extremely oily/shiny skin.  That also has gotten better."
7660,1,"Messy_When you open it even if there's no wind or anything it still goes everywhere so you need to have a designated area to do this in.  It's just glitter in a jar.  Super fine glitter in a jar.  Goes on thick since it's so fine.  Not really any way to get a small amount since it static-clings together.  The best part is that it comes in 12 different colors to match any nail art decoration you are doing.  Very good, but very messy."
3594,1,good bleaching powers_i have solid black hair and this got me from night black to blonde blonde in under an hour...this is good stuff without the worries of too much chemical burns and it actually leaves your hair really soft after the rinse than brittle.
6778,1,"MUST HAVE_I ordered this with some other sleek blushes and palettes for reduced shipping. Was not expecting to like it so much. It is, on my NC25 skin, amazingly natural. It is a satin finish with no noticeable shimmer at all. It just looks like a natural, refined blush."
1068,1,Excellent cleanser_Murad Cleanser it a great face washing product.  It really cleans your face without drying it out.  It leaves your face feeling nice and soft.
8750,1,"Very nice_I like this hair clip, it's very pretty and looks good in my hair. I just have to figure out how to use it in my hair. It's different than other hair clipsSincerely, Mrs. Rick"
2370,0,Ummm_I must be defective because I put 3 layers if this on my arms and felt a slight tingle/itching sensation. Granted they say contact them for instructions regarding body application but I figured it couldn't be THAT difficult or that much different from the facial instructions. I applied the tca Monday ... It's only Wednesday but my arms are just dry. I don't really think anything is going to happen and I'm kind of annoyed -_-.
2736,1,"Work well_I use the kabuki brush for mineral foundation.I use the eyeshadow brush for eyeshadow base.They work nicely, though I wish the kabuki brush was more firm!"
4676,1,"The only thing that works_I am a 47year old woman who has tried everything to keep my skin clear of pimples.this is the only product brand that works,"
6048,0,stopped working only after using it twice_I am very disappointed as the brush stopped working only after using it twice. I cannot return it as I am not in US and cannot post it from here....
3319,1,"I like it._But I don't LOVE it. It started creasing under my eyes only minutes after putting it on. I use it for blemishes now instead of under eye concealer. It does well on other areas, I just didn't like it under my eyes."
8487,1,"Super glue_I generally keep my hair short enough that I don't have to use gels and mousse to keep it in place, but when my hair does get a little long and unruly, I prefer something solid to really hold it in place. I wasn't exactly sure what Axe meant when they said 'messy look', but I figured that if it could hold hair in what would be considered a messy look, it not only would be very strong at holding hair, but it would also hold 'not messy hair' just as well. I held my breath one morning, and gave it a shot, carefully following the three step instructions: a little dab on one finger, spread across all fingers, rub quickly into your hair and scalp.First of all, this stuff is really, really thick and sticky. It's like a cross between toothpaste and wood filler, with week oldElmer's Washable No-Run School Glue, 4 oz Bottle (E304)mixed in for good measure. I worked quickly and rifled it through my hair. I looked in the mirror and started laughing. My hair was all over the place like something out of a zombie apocalypse. The missus took one look at it and said, 'You are NOT going to work like that.' I said I was done styling  and thought it looked great, but she said I looked like Beavis. I ran a comb through my hair, but it was pretty much useless. The hair was set, and yes, messy look. I received several comments on my hair that day, none positive, but that's only because people weren't ready for my 'not straitlaced' look. I used it one more time after that, with similar results. Notable is the fact that with my hair done up in this stuff, even wearing a hat did not move my hair around much. Very powerful styling gum, to say the least.So if you are a man going for that rough and tumble look, I highly, highly recommend this product. You will get what you seek if you are seeking that 'blown out of a wind tunnel and rolled down the side of a hill' sort of hairdo. If you want to substitute this for your normal gel to get your normal appearance, I hope your best friend is Butt-Head. Otherwise, this is not for you."
9818,1,"good substitue_Good alternate to the orginal clarsonic brush heads. Fits, spins, and my skin feels exfoliated afterwards. I don't notice a difference form the orginal and a lot cheaper. Comes as a pair. A little rattle with these generic brushheads, but doesn't affect function and nothing that bothers me. Good substitute."
3506,1,"After many years, I have found something that works!!!_First off I am not an employee of the company , nor did I get anything free. This is an honest opinion of mine. I have horrible cellulite on my thighs and butt. I have tried so many things , some seem to work others not. By the time I notice a difference, those bottles were empty,so on to something new. WOW, For those who say there is no burn...Are you kidding me?  There is a burn/tingle but you need to take proper steps in order to feel the burn..and there is one.  Take your shower be sure to exfoliate, then put it on right after getting out. Your pores will be open and ready to absorb the product. Be very careful not to get some on you jay-jay, thats a whole new story !!!!!I was running around the house like a wounded chicken. If you want an extreme action, wrap it your legs in plastic wrap, if you can stand it then it will work really good for you. I couldn't handle the burn for more than 4 or 5 minutes, felt like fire ants, . I  just sit with a blanket snug around me ,that too will bring the heat out. I did and still see benefits to using the lotion. First application I saw about a 25% reduction.  It could have been because the wrap or just the skin tightening around my thighs. I do massage it in  while sitting on the couch watching TV, it burns but I make it work.You must remember there is no magic cream, you need to eat right, do some exercise and make a commitment to this. If your gonna skip days, eat junk foods and couch potato yourself, then why bother. I also use skin firming cream about two hours after applying Extreme 3D. If you put in on close it will just curd up on you. We all are different and some lose it fast, others take time. I continue using it because i feel it is working along with my healthy life style i just started. I wore shorts out the other night to a dinner and then the club. It's been three years that I have put some on, so i do feel it is working or the shorts would not have happened ..at all !!! I gave it four stars because sometimes the burn is toooo intense to keep on."
1054,0,"I thought my gorgeous naturally kinky curls would fall out my scalp was on fire hair was straw!!! run it's cheap 4 a reason_OMG this is the pure crap!!!I've bleached my hair, relaxed it, went natural, used heat and all natural products to chemical laden and everything else. I've had natural ingredients deteriorate my hair and had chemically laden products leave it manageable and beautiful and vice versa. ie.. never had issues with relaxers, mineral oil, or semi-permanent colors. Yet ACV, Baking soda,kinky curly, as i am natural, camille rose, and certain protein treatments recked havoc on my hair despite being natural.This stuff reminded me of apple cider vinegar in that it left my hair dull, matted, and dried to F-ing H-E-L-L. My hair was strong, long and healthy when I used this on my had that was free of color as I had cut all of the color off. My hair is thick and wavy/curly as most afro- caribs/dominicans and my hair looked like a poofy frizzy cotton ball that had been dipped in black pen ink. The ink only looks black from a distance but up close looks blue like jeans dying on to your sneakers after it rained.My scalp turned red and I am brown skin like kerry washington complexion's. It felt like it was on fire for 3 days Literally. And I did the patch test. This crap didn't start burning until I was halfway through my hair (5-6 mins) I was miserable. I washed my hair with a sulfate free shampoo that had a few essential herbs added to it. And then applied the ultra sheen/ultra care moisture blend serum i got from walmart to my scalp. The tingling sensation calmed my scalp down to where I was no longer in  pain and could actually sleep after being on my scalp overnight. I think because the serum is purely natural oils (coconut,castor and avocado) and only has several herbal extracts which are more potent than infusions and a bht a preservative added; it fixed the dull/dryness of my hair  and raw feeling of my scalp by regulating everything. I still had to condition my hair (used pantene smooth and sleek w/ argan to get all the tangles out without ripping out my hair since it is protein free I get more elasticity). Then I used crece pelo treatment as a leave in ( the new formula has silk protein not my favorite protein kind of loathe it but in this case it worked so no complaints) and it strengthen my hair is back to normal without leaving it too coarse, tangled r dry. I still hate this color though. It is not natural looking like the blue blacks I've used in the past. Maybe b/c those were semi-permanent not sure. My hair is medium brown and now it is so black it barely shines. I want to use color opps to get my hair back to it's natural color which I appreciate so much more now, but am scared it'll dry my hair out. So, I will deal with this ulgy crap color  until I can get across the country to the only stylist I trust."
6583,1,"Colorful and very nice_The polish collection arrived on time and was as described.  To be honest some of the colors were just a little bright for me.  I am a middle aged woman and mother and most of these colors were more for the teen to late 20 crowd.  The polishes did go on smoothly and dried quickly.  They last quite well.  There were a few that I felt comfortable wearing and they lasted longer than my usual polish.  So, I will want to buy more.OK I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND, thanks to being thought how to use these colors.  My daughter took me to a friend of hers that does nails who showed me how to use these colors properly to get very nice effects.  I now love these colors, and will definately be ordering more.  My Daughter also found me a couple how to magazines for other ideas.  I guess a slightly older woman can learn new things.These colors are not just for the teen to late 20 crowd.  LindaW"
1015,1,"jo jo from baltimore_It is absolute truth, you only need 3 drops, after my face toner, and before moisturizer or serum, it completely moisture barriers the skin, making the products very much more effective!  Long wait to receive it though!"
156,1,Dark Blonde L'Oreal Paris hair color_I have been using L'Oreal for several years now and I have to say that it has been much superior to the other brands.  It seems to hold the color longer and gives you a healthy shine.
3246,0,Two Stars_Don't like then after use the tip loose the form
7677,1,"Very Nice_I really like these.  They left my skin clean, soft, and not at all dried out.  The last was especially impressive because a lot of products I've used in the past seem to suck all the moisture out of my skin.There is a very, very slight soap/cleanser smell, but it is not at all overpowering, which is important to me since I'm sensitive to smells.  I do wish they foamed a bit more when used; as is you have to be very careful to clean all your skin, a task I think is easier if there is a little foam generated.My only real complaint is that the adhesive designed to keep the package closed didn't work very well.  The towelettes started to dry out, so I ended up storing the whole thing in a plastic container.  Other than that, I thought this was a good product."
3146,1,"flawless light coverage, not too cakey_I've been using MAC powder for years, but i always noticed how i looked a little cakey.  Plus, i live in a hot climate and any time i wear makeup i sweat and it just looks wrong.  anyway, i thought i'd try this little powder, i like the other benefit products i've tried, so i gave this a chance.  i do like it better than the mac powder i've used for so long.  it's not cakey at all, it doesnt feel heavy or look heavy.  i have fair skin and frecles and lots of red spots.  this covered up my red spots nicely, and still let my freckles show thru.  it definatly gives a nice smooth finish with out looking like you have a bunch of makeup smeared on your face.  I'd say it's worth the price."
7940,1,AWESOME TOOLS!!!_I fell in love with nail art recently and NEEDED this kit! So happy when it arrived! The entire kit comes in a little zippered pouch which makes it convenient for storing and travelling. It's perfect. Each dotting tool is double sided and the brushes are different sizes as well. It will effectively aid you me in all of my nail art ideas. I'm very happy with my purchase!
1051,1,"My favorite color_I bought these on sale thru Amazon.  This is my favorite color.  It has a tad but of red to it and covering my grey that is starting to show and the old dull brown, well with this on it looks great.  I get lots of compliments from work on this color and it is the only color now I will buy.  The only drawback, but that is with all coloring, is I have to use a separate towel for my hair as after first coloring it, maybe the first two weeks, that color comes off a little with each washing and ends up on the towel."
2357,0,"Did not work for me_This product flaked off of my nails within hours of application. I contacted the seller, and they apologized, and sent me another one. I assumed that maybe it was a bad bottle, or an old one. When the second one came in the mail, the exact same thing happened. It flaked off immediately. I didn't contact the seller again, but I threw out both bottles. I've heard very good things about this brand of top coat, but either there was a problem with the bottles they sent me, or somehow, the product was not compatible with my fingernails. (I applied the product to bare, clean fingernails)"
9416,1,"Love the bottle, serum works pretty well_This serum is a clear, thin liquid that comes in a pretty blue bottle with a dropper. The instructions say to rub 2-3 drops into your face and neck morning and night; However, for me I found that 2-3 drops wasn't enough to cover my whole face, so I used more like 5-6 drops.The serum absorbs quickly and I do feel like it brightened my skin and helped keep my face moist and healthy. It's not quite as potent as similar serums I have tried, but I think it works pretty well. I wish it was a little more moisturizing."
7521,1,great polish_I love this polish duo! And the price really is great for a set of two of them. They're normally $20 a piece!
9253,1,"The best product who live in state without sunshine._I live in Oregon and need more vitamin D.This is the right amount of IU's, which are hard to find.The price is very good also.My wife is also taking this same supplement and we have both noticed improvement.These are easy to swallow & I really like this particular brand & doseage of D3.I do seem to notice a difference in my mood & overall health when taking this supplement.It does not upset my stomach at all."
5055,1,Works Wonders_I used this product along with the Kinky Curly Knot Today and It exceeded my expectations. I will be purchasing more. Please refer to the product link to see my review of the Knot today. It feels so light on my hair and smells really great.Kinky Curly Knot Today8 oz
4589,1,"Would not do without it._I was told a long time ago that Squalane in beauty products can really make a difference.  I first noticed it in my Elizabeth Arden Skin Illuminating Cream, which I have used for 20 years and absolutely love it. However, it was not in all of their products that I use so when I saw this on Amazon I started buying it and adding it to my other creams and even my Nivea body cream.  I cannot say enough about this product.  It is pure 100% Olive refined oil which I have been told for years is wonderful for your skin, not too greasy just right."
3967,1,"Love this shade!_Perfect addition to my Spring collection.  Gret formula, only took two coats to fully cover without streaks.  I still used a top coat."
8444,1,"Luxurious, clean-rinsing conditioner_I'm a guy, and have pretty short hair, so 'breakage' isn't an issue for me. Still, I got this to sample through the Vine program and have been using it for a little while:Pros:+ moisturizing, but rinses very clean. No residue, so my already-coarse hair dries off smooth and soft. Lots of conditioners leave an oily kind of residue after rinsing, which in my coarse hair basically means it gets yucky quickly, so it's nice when a conditioner rinses off clean.+ awesome fragrance... sort of sugary, but in a conditioner-y way. Very sweet but not cloying.Cons:- can't really think of any. Could maybe stand to be a little cheaper... but then, I'm a guy and am not used to spending much $$$ on this sort of thing.Overall: if you're looking for something to help you out with your dry hair but are also looking to avoid conditioners that leave residue, this may be worth a shot."
5116,1,"Good stuff- Didn't buy off of Amazon_This is moisturizing and smells good. I would recommend it to someone who is in good health with their hair. I have over processed blonde hair and it doesn't help with the damage. However, It definitely wouldn't hurt to try it! Everyone's hair is different. I DID NOT buy this off of Amazon. I bought it from my local salon."
3584,1,"great steamer!_This is a perfect size steamer for use at home. The lady that I get my facials done from uses this so I ordered one to use once or twice a week at home. It heats up in 5 mins and provides a good steady stream of steam for about 20 mins if you fill up the water to the max line. The water container does get really hot so you have to wait a bit before removing it. Besides that, it's great!"
6495,1,"Works so far_I've always been a little skeptical about the benefits of using an eye cream in addition to facial moisturizers, so that's why I think it's insane when I see people spending ridiculous amounts of money for all of the eye creams out there.What I like about this one is that a little goes a long way, there is no scent to cause any irritation, and I can have it auto-delivered by Amazon at an even lower cost than buying it anywhere else.  It goes on smoothly and after using it for about 7 days, I can say that the area around my eyes does not appear dried out or tired looking.  Perhaps the benefits will be even more so as I continue to use it, but so far I have no complaints whatsoever."
7489,0,"I'll treat my scalp other ways, thank-you_To begin, there's one thing the company could have done to improve this product:  instructions.  Because right now I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that I simply have not discovered the right way to use this stuff.  Because I have been using it just like I would use any other similar product.Only benefit: I have felt some improvement in my scalp's condition.Otherwise, this is messy, greasy, and even a conservative amount leaves my roots oily and my hair heavy, lifeless, and with a strange texture.So this works well for the scalp, but for the hair itself?  Terrible."
7837,1,"not oily if you use it right!_My stylist recommended this the last time I was in. I was using Super Skinny from Paul Mitchell when blow-drying and straightening, but I like this a lot better. It's not heavy feeling, very light, and it smells really nice, a sweet kind of almondy floral scent, and my hair looks great when I use it, whether I blowdry or let it dry curly. I can't get over how light my hair feels with it, it's lighter with it on than if I use nothing at all. It's a great detangler and leaves just a little bit of shine. You do have to be careful not to use too much, I use about a pea-sized amount for my mid-length bob. If you use too much it can get greasy. Otherwise I love it! Pricey but lasts forever, would buy again."
8928,1,ok_this  item is a nice inexspensive item for a gifr for a little girl. it was what iwas expecting and I really do like it
1995,1,"Interesting_So I've never really used a moisturizer/tanning lotion stuff. It has kind of a peachy smell, so far I seem to like it."
2650,0,"No Dramatic Change_Well, it FEELS good going on....cool to the skin. But after 3 weeks of use every morning and night, no noticeable difference. Now cucumber pads, THOSE are great...get them on Amazon too!"
46,1,"Olay Complete all day Moisturizer with Sunscreen._All 3  arrived in great condition, and I use quite a lot of this product in the Summer time. I have tried so many other costly sunscreen products, and found them all to be rather sticky.  I am handicapped and like to sit outside in good weather. I used to freckle up so much, even though many sunscreens say up to 30 minutes.  But with this light formula I don't have to use very much, and I don't look like our Dalmatian.  This is sort of funny, but when I used other sunscreen products my sweet dog didn't like the smell and she wouldn't sit real close to me out  side.  Animals are very sensitive to smells.  It is a very nice product, and I'm sure that other customers will enjoy it also as the moisturizer keeps the skin so nice and soft."
2839,0,"Doesn't do anything._This conditioner just doesn't moisturize as well as other deep conditioners.  I bought it because I'm using the curly girl method and this one doesn't have any of the &#34;bad&#34; stuff in it.  I'm just not happy with how my hair feels afterward, it's not softer or smoother.  I'm also disappointed with the fact that I continue to get split ends despite using it for the past few months.  I guess my search continues."
5458,1,"Excellent hair dryer!_Fast, relatively quiet, and leaves hair looking great. I really didn't expect the results I saw with this dryer. My hair tends to be frizzy.....but this dryer tames it quite well. So glad I found it."
9048,1,this is really good_I've been kind of done with oil stuff because it looks good for 1=2 days and suddenly your hair dies.This makes it silky and it has far longer that it looks good. My hair was reprocessed becaue I didn't like the color and it was really dry but it's my secret with this stuff.
7219,0,Trash_It wouldn't cut through ANYTHING. Dull and worthless. It doesn't even deserve one star.. Went straight to the trash can
8793,1,"Underrated Product!_I've struggled with uneven skin texture for I have no idea how long. I've used everything and tried everything to smooth out my skin so that my makeup goes on without dry patches in random places. I've used this for 2 days and my skin is tremendously different! I honestly didn't think this product was going to work but I figure, why not try anyways. My skin is SOOOO freaking smooth and even texture and just overall AMAZING. Did I mention the smell? Ugh I LOVE the smell of this stuff and its so creamy and dries quickly and doesn't make you feel oily or anything. If you are struggling with uneven texture I seriously recommend this product cause in just a couple days you will see a difference, at least I def did. Will DEF be rebuying!"
5810,1,"Easy Peasy_Now that I'm old enough that my face doesn't break out anymore, I use these to wipe away what little makeup I wear at night (mineral powder and mascara) and followup with a warm wash cloth.  I don't like the film left behind by wipes so I always rinse afterwards with the wash cloth and then follow with my moisturizer.  These are so easy to use and eliminate the water/sink mess I always used to make in the evening."
4509,1,I love this mascara!_I accidentally purchased this item over the Falsies Flared and found a pleasant surprise. This one works MUCH better! This one actually works on my tough to curl Asian lashes! It is an awesome mascara and people definitely need to give it a try. The Falsies Flared disappointed me with it's lack of volume but this Falsies original gives me both volume and length. Just make sure you do not wiggle the wand back and forth when you apply. I found it works best when you have the 'scoop' against your lases and push straight up. Definitely give this one a try! Especially if you have difficult lashes.
5501,1,"Very good product_This is a great product, especially when used with the complimenting Bamboo Shine conditioner. This product conditions my hair and leaves it super soft without weighing it down at all. I definitely recommend it."
4978,1,"Re-ordered a couple times now_I found this scent about 2 years ago, and I think I'm on my third bottle now. I like it because it's not too over powering, but still smells really good and is more &#34;unique&#34;. It's so much less expensive here than in stores too! So win-win."
4319,1,"Great_This foundation blends really well with my skin. It doesn't last all day but I think I may just need a better primer and setting powder.I will definitely continue to keep buying it. I use the beautyblender sponge so the finish looks completely natural on my skin and I LOVE it.I also love how it feels on my skin. Previous foundations (I'm looking at you Mac) feel very heavy on my skin, but this doesn't even feel like I'm wearing makeup on my face."
2258,1,Great for hands_I love this for my hands they are looking less dry from this cold weather and younger by using this! Now if I can keep my little one from thinking he has to use it!!!
1839,0,"DEAD BUG INSIDE!!!_There was a DEAD INSECT IN IT!!!!! NASTY!!!! DO NOT ORDER THIS!!! Do they not have any quality control at all, WTF???"
4562,1,Use it daily_This toner smells great and doesn't irritate my skin at all.  It leaves my face feeling fresh- I use it every night before bed.  Soft but not overpowering smell.
2428,1,"The best!_I love glycerin for my hair, especially during warmer months. I was glad to find so much for a reasonable price. The bottle has spilled in my hair bag, but even with that mess, I still love the product. I just put it in a baggy, just in case."
3907,1,"This was a great buy!_There is already an excellent, in depth review on this item written by Chandler on Sept 15, 2011 titled 'First-hand comparison between the Clarisonic and the Nutrasonic cleaning systems' and there is little I can add to that . I didn't own the Clarisonic model but I did get a chance to try it out and I, too, preferred the Nutra Sonic for its cost and feel.  I have had this item for 2 years now and its still kicking and working marvelously.Face:The brushes have been economical to replace.  I have sensitive skin that tends to get dry so I only use it once a day at night. I've found that the normal one feels just a little harsher and the softer sensitive brush head feels perfect for me. That one has been harder to find than the normal brush but I've found them on ebay for about $11-$15.Body:One other thing I like about this particular model is that you can use the body brush, which is a little larger. It seems that you can submerge the cleanser itself in water (not the charger) and I use it in baths but I try not to push my luck and try to avoid doing that but so far its held up fine. I try to take a bath once a week ( I do shower in between those baths..) and I've recently started adding bath salts or milk mixtures to them. I've tried 3-4 different brands but so far my favorite has been100% Pure Sea Therapy Bath - Organic Eucalyptus 427g/15oz, and100% Pure Organic Sea Therapy Bath Soak for Body --Lavender -- 15 oz.( I tend to lean towards the lavender a bit more). I add them to my bath, after soaking about 15 minutes I use this brush to exfoliate and, afterwards, my skin feels sooo soft and smooth.Overall, I've been really happy with it.  The benefit of this daily gentle exfoliation is that removing all the extra dead skin on your face doesn't just help your face glow but also allows better for better absorption of product so whatever product you are using, it will help you get the most of it."
1293,1,Favorite Dermalogica Product_This dermal clay cleanser makes your skin feel very clean. My skin looks so much better after using this product. Can't live w/out it!
8078,0,poorly made_this headband was forced into  a way too small envelope and the beading was crushed as well as missing lots of beads. very disappointed
1666,0,"I do not like this at all._My hairdresser gave this to me to try. My hair is naturally coarse and curly. I had my highlights and low lights done which can really do a number on it. Luckily I didn't pay for it. So after washing my hair, I sprayed this thick lotion substance on my hair (It's a 10) and worked it through. Why they package this in a spray bottle is beyond me. It should be in a tube or squeeze bottle. My hair felt gross. It felt like I had put shampoo conditioner in my hair. I couldn't even run my fingers through my hair without yanking them through and pulling hair out in the process. I let my hair air dry and it was left feeling knotted and greasy. This was my first attempt at using It's a 10. My second attempt (this time using less product) went pretty much the same way. A little product does NOT go a long way. I couldn't wait to shampoo this JUNK out of my hair. Why it gets raving reviews? I have no idea. Maybe this works for people with thin, flat, straight hair because it sure didn't work for me. My advice is to find a sample of the product or ask your hair person for a hook up just so you know whether or not this will work on your hair. It's an expensive product and some places will not give you a refund of your money. Surely it must be good for some people since it has such a high rating."
4023,1,"Awesome stuff!_I used to spend a fortune at my Skin Care lady's office and Dermatologist's, but a little bit of  research here and there, the latest technology and discoveries on the skin, plus the internet equals I'm saving big bucks and my skin has never looked better.I have had the Glycolic peel done several times previously and spent about $150 for each visit. Let me just say, it is sooo nice to be able to buy the product myself and apply it at home for a fraction of the cost.I read other reviews on here for people that have dry skin. But I have oily skin, so I'm lucky there. I just use a little extra moisturizer after wards and the following day or two and I'm good to go.What I also like about this Glycolic is it's a very aggressive treatment but you don't have the down time of a TCA peel or intense laser treatment. You may see some mild peeling, a few days after. But really, just no social down time and excellent results. GREAT for acne proned skin. Lightens hyper-pigmentation (at least for me) more effectively than just about any product or treatment out there.I recommend this product all the way!!! Just be conservative with the application and follow the instructions to the T. And you do need to continue to re-apply treatments ongoing, just like working out or anything else. It has to be a 'way of life' if you want better skin."
4694,1,This product is great_Love this product line. have used it before and will continue to buy this product in the future.  this product nongreasy
1603,0,"wouldnt buy again_i ordered a few of these in different colors. i have used this brand before, but they have changed the little plastic piece on the tip. you used to be able to push it down to get it out of the way, but now you cant, and it gets in the way and you have to twist the tip way up just for it to not scrape you! i wont purchase this again! the delivery was great and was well packaged. no issues with seller!"
9389,1,"Absolutely amazing and fading sun spots and acne scars! Truly impressive!_I've been left with some nasty scars I've been anxious to fade. When my Day by Day Beauty Vitamin C serum showed up a few weeks ago, I started using it morning and night immediately, to see if I'd start seeing results quickly.I was completely impressed to see a difference with in days, Yeah, you read that right, within days! I've tried so many fancy creams for fading sun spots and acne scars, and while some do work well, most do not, and even the good ones can take months before you start seeing a difference, not to mention you're using harsh chemicals to do it.Vitamin C Serum's naturally brighten the skin, reverse the effects of sun damage by lightening and fading those ugly sun spots, clarify the skin, restore skin's elasticity, helps the skin retain moisture, minimizes the size of pores, even reduces fine lines and wrinkles. It's truly an ALL-IN-ONE beauty product that works naturally, effectively, and is a whole lot cheaper than a lot of skin care products out there.Because Day by Day Beauty's Vitamin C Serum is natural, it's safe for all skin types too. Sensitive skin types rejoice! You know how hard it is to find skin care products that will fade those sun spots while still being soft and gentle to your extra sensitive skin!What I love about the serum, is it is super lightweight too. I washed my face morning and night, squirted a drop on to my fingers (only takes one for me) and blotted it over my face. My skin soaked it up within minutes. Because its also naturally moisturizing, this is a great product for those with oily skin as well. You probably won't even need a moisturizer besides this serum. Because my skin is dry, I still needed to apply my moisturizer after, but I still found this serum to be quite moisturizing for my extra dry skin.This serum is also not sticky at all, which I've tried a few other Vitamin C serums, and often times they can be, so I really loved that this one is not sticky in the least.You will also find no parabens, alcohol, or fillers in this product. AND its cruelty-free! Yay!I've been using this product for a few weeks now and have been so happy with the results. My acne scars have faded significantly, even so that even my husband noticed this last week and commented on it! Also, I have been out in the sun a bunch lately and always get new sun spots this time of year. I had some pop up a week ago right under my eyes and a little bit above my upper lip. First off, I was like, Ok I need to be applying sunscreen better here, so I started doing that, but normally every summer, when these sun spots pop up, I can expect to see them until fall. Amazingly enough, over the last week while using my Day by Day anti aging vitamin c serum, those sun spots completely disappeared! I wish I would've thought to take a before and after picture!I'm beyond impressed, because like I said, new sun spots I get in the summer, tend to stick around until fall, and somehow all three of these spots faded completely within a week. I can't even tell that they are there now! Absolutely amazing!I don't always see such great results with beauty products, in fact its usually hard to test them out for a few weeks and notice much of a difference, but Vitamin C serum's are completely where it's at! I always notice a big difference, and almost immediately, when using one!I'm loving the Day by Day Beauty Vitamin C Serum and have been so happy and pleased with the results, I know this is a serum I will be using forever! Seriously! I'm that impressed with it! If there is one beauty product I'd recommend to everyone, Vitamin C serum is absolutely it, and you can't go wrong with Day by Day Beauty's Vitamin C formula!"
6914,0,"not what was pictured!_i give one star because i, like others got flat little glitter hearts, which was not what was pictured. when i contacted the seller they gave me a full refund but i would have perferred the product that was shown, if you want to take a gamble- go ahead."
1600,1,"My favorite liquid foundation_I've tried a bunch of liquid foundations and this one is by far the best. There are so many shades that you're sure to find the one that matches you the best. It's medium coverage, very matte, doesn't crease and feels light as a feather. I love all of the True Match line by L'oreal."
7366,1,"Believe me when I say this color is MUST HAVE_I've never seen such a gorgeous summer color before&#8230;. it's like beyond words how great this polish is. It paints on PERFECT, it's shiny, and flat / even so it doesn't clump, does not chip easily, looks exactly like the color in the bottle.Honestly this nail polish could not be more perfect and I think that everyone needs to have it."
6241,0,"Smells like lube! [updated review]_I've used lots of argan oils, I'm pretty open-minded about the cheaper ones because... they're cheaper. Those usually run a little thinner, maybe less nutrient dense. But I just got this bottle of Watts, and it's suspicious to me. Greasy, pale (almost clear), and it smells like lube!! It should smell nutty, and absorb much faster.Is this a mixture?? Is it just this bottle?? I'll be emailing Watts, will update post if new info comes to light.Just read some other reviews about similar experience. Sounds like this product was better in the past.--Update - I just did a test on my leg with 2 other argan oils. I put 1 drop of each on on my leg and rubbed into separate circles (with different fingers). The Watts DID NOT ABSORB. It was a greasy circle on my leg. The other two (Shea Terra Organics and Elma & Sanna) absorbed within 30 seconds. Ended up wiping off Watts with a tissue.Real argan oil is supposed to absorb quickly, and the whole point is that it's not greasy. Red flag.--Update #2The seller sent me a replacement bottle this week. The new bottle is BETTER than what I got the first time, so everyone keep a pulse on what you get! This one has less smell, less greasy.I changed my rating from 1 to 2 stars. It's still not that impressive to me... doesn't feel 'arganny' and I can't put my finger on it. Maybe the lack of a nutty smell? Slower rate of absorption? Mostly, it seems par for the price. Not horrible, but no praises to sing compared to others.Very responsive customer service. They refunded me and also sent a new bottle. There you have it."
4634,0,raw african black soap_This soap gets your face squeaky clean to the point that by the time your done with one wash you have absolutely no moisture left in your face at all.  Probably good for oily skin but certainly not for mature dry skin!
7152,1,Is ok_This product work perfect take off the gel polish but the trueis if you use foil and cotton or some pad work ok too
7041,0,"No visible difference_If this is making a difference, it must all be subcutaneous, because I see no change on the surface of my skin.  Possibly one must use it for a lot longer and buy lots more bottles of it, but I am not willing to make that bet."
4120,1,"Love it! works like a charm_I've had this for a few months now, it works like it should.the consistency is firm and smooth. i would definitely  buy this eye shadow primer again!"
4342,1,Makes Your Skin Soft_This lotion makes your skin really soft. I haven't really seen a big difference in my skin and I've been using it for around 2 months. I have a few minor fine lines I've been trying to diminish. I will finish the bottle and try something different.
6180,1,Neutral Palette_I received this product faster than shipping date. The palette came in one piece with no damage and very nicely packaged. Everything was beautiful. I am looking forward to using this beautiful palette all the time. It was all around a great investment.
6028,0,nailene_i recieved my guides today. i was dissapointed bc i thought i was getting 2 of the chevron nail guides. they sent me 4 regular french tip guides. i can never find the chevron tips and thats why i chose to order. waste of money bc i alreayy have the nailene tips that you can buy at walmart.
4920,0,Didn't do anything for me._I didn't use it consistently but I feel a regular cleanser works way better than this pricy cleanser. Waste of money!!!!!!!
9562,1,Perfect for my hair!_I have brown straight hair that I like to have cut very short and then use gel to move it forward and spike it up. I have tried many of these-with varying degrees of success-and I have to rank this in the top 5% off all of the gels I have tried in the past. It held my hair perfect and stayed that way for the whole day.Axe is the best!  Another great product by Axe!
9905,1,"Leaves my face feeling so clean and softer!_I received a product sample and it really does leave my skin feeling more hydrated, brighter and is great for my combination skin. I tend to have sensitive skin at times and this product even works extremely well on my skin. My skin feels so clean and the texture really feels softer. I also love that you can hang it up in the shower.Self Disclosure: I received a product sample for free but all opinions expressed are truthful."
6977,1,"Worth A Try_I use a face cleanser each night as part of my nightly ritual . I (my wife) has a light complexion combination who uses make-up daily. My daily cleanser used to beNeutrogena Oil-Free Deep Clean Cream Cleanser, 7 Ouncebut I found it to be too harsh on my face. I was excited to try the Biore Combination Cleanser since it seems like a perfect fit for my skin type.Notes-- Does not lather as well as some cleansers- I have the need to double rinse my face- Much gentler on my skin when compared to the  Neutrogena Oil Free- Great fragrance - very refreshing, but it does not linger after you rinse.- Removes all of my make-up (although I rarely wear eye make-up)- I have not had any type of allergic reactionFinal Verdict - I will continue to use the Biore Combination Skin Cleanser to see if balances out my skin, but so far (2 weeks) I have been very impressed!4 1/2 Stars"
3788,0,"stinky_Returning, this has intense smell to it that gave me one of my migraines (I'm sensitive to perfumes) and that isn't mentioned  in the online description. Went to local drug store where I could smell the stuff, AND it was cheaper!"
7676,1,"Cheap but great_I did not want to spend alot on products and this is cheap and works great. I thought cheap woukd be bad, but not with this product"
7058,1,"So cute!_This is a great piece...but it's a blend so ixnay on the flat iron.  It doesn't require a lot of styling manipulation out of the box- just some hand raking and go.  The colors are fun and maybe a little bold, but it's a great piece for a quick, finished look.  I bought two to have one for back up."
3244,1,So far im loving it!_Unlike the Motions Naturally You Radiating Hair gloss I like this one way better. It has a nice light smell and actually penetrates the scalp. I use this regularly and it doesn't leave my hair feeling oily at all.It helps with dry scalp and its very easy to dispense. So far so good!
6125,1,Beautiful!_First off I love these beautiful colored rhinestones! They are so pretty I love my nails with the different colors on different now polishes when I do my nails they're absolutely beautiful.!
7611,1,"Cute even on darker skin_Compared to the fair skinned model hand, I am tan and the color still looks great.  Enjoy the product and the quality."
7785,1,"everything it claims to be!_This stuff is amazing! I was a department store junkie and I would buy day/night creams in the 60-200 range. I decided to use the more expensive serums and a natural more affordable cream over the top of that and I am SO glad I did. This stuff is incredible! It leaves my skin very smooth and soft, it does not get tacky at all and the scent is so fresh and wonderful I just love it!*scent- fresh and clean It is subtle and it does not linger.* moisturization- this stuff is VERY hydrating without being heavy or tacky. I find that if I warm it up in my hands before applying it glides on better. It also does not clog my pores or irritate my skin.*results- When I wash my face at night my skin is still very soft thanks to this day lotion. I have dry combination flaky skin and this cream is keeping the flakes away and really moisturizing the dry areas. I absolutely love it!overall this is a 5 star product and I am blown away at the results for the price. I love this stuff and will continue to use it for a long time. I will update this review if anything changes."
8318,1,"Nice, light mousse!_The scent of this mousse is light and inoffensive. It gives your hair more body than crispy hold, which is just what I am usually looking for. I let my hair dry naturally, and put it into a loose pony tail while still slightly damp. I used the Suave Kids Cherry Vanilla Bop Mousse to crunch the curls on top, and smoothed a very small amount of it on the rest. They held nicely all day, and it was very damp and rainy. Usually, that almost guarantees that I will end up with frizz, but this mousse worked very well.I will definitely add this product to my collection of hair products. I frequently switch around to provent product build-up, but this one is a guaranteed keeper."
796,1,Love it!_I have been doing my own manicures for years now and absolutely love this nail polish remover! It takes just a few seconds to get even several coats of high quality nail polish off.
9446,1,"BB for My Body!_First, it was BB cream for the face. Now, it's BB cream for the body. What a great idea. It's nice to have our skin look its best no matter what part of our body it's on.Jergen's BB cream squeezes out thick and tinted and goes on smoothly. I don't really bother with trying to get it on evenly. The tint isn't strong enough to cause problems with streaking or staining my clothes, especially since it dries so quickly. I put it on right before getting dressed and haven't had any problems.I don't feel the moisturizing effect as much as I do with regular moisturizers. As for the other promised effects, my skin tone was already pretty even, firm and smooth before starting the BB cream. It looks pretty good right now. I'd like to think the BB cream is helping improve the tone ever so subtly. I honestly can't see much difference, but the psychological effect has been positive.The only thing this cream is missing is a sunblock. Otherwise, it's a good body cream."
6576,1,"Good buy!_I received the rhinestones within 5 business days, and they were packaged well. No rhinestones were spilled in the package, and were well separated in the wheel. Like the other reviews state, there are many types of shapes, sizes, and colors, which will last a while for me atleast. The rhinestones are small, but a good size for creating nail designs. I have really enjoyed the product."
9546,0,"Good for an emergency dry shampoo but the odor is so heavy!_This product does a good job of removing oil and some dirt in between shampoos. And I tried this and it was very effective for this, but I just about gagged when I smelled the very heavy perfume in this product. Since I am sensitive to heavy perfumes, I was concerned about this, yet it did not do any harm to my scalp. And after I opened up seveal windows, and after about 40 minutes, the strong scent began to fade.PROS:+ Effective on my fine and fly away hair. And this cleaned it well and my hair shined+ Great to use in a pinch or when I want a fresh shampooed look when I am in a hurry.MAJOR CONS:- HORRIBLE SCENT.- Personally, I cannot recommend this because of the heavy scent."
6803,1,"great deal!!!_Okay so I love doing my nails at home instead of paying someone else to do them sooo much cheaper! This stuff works great and buying the entire kit in pieces is WAY cheaper than buying it all together, because lets face it rubbing alcohol is rubbing alcohol and acetone is cheaper in bulk! Just always remember THIN coats people!"
7054,1,"shea butter_I did alot of research about this product before buying it and everyone was talking about how amazing it is for any and all skin types. So I initially bought some at a flea market and I absolutely loved it. I use it for everything, I use this product for my hair, skin and on my 4 year old son. Everyone wants to know what I use on my skin and I tell them, Black soap and Shea butter, I will never buy any other soap or lotion. This shea butter is a little sweeter smelling than any others that I have bought, but works just a good."
8882,1,Love this stuff_I have coarse curly hair that I straighten.  This oil makes it feel so soft and smooth.  I also love the smell.
4303,1,Wonderful facial hydrator_Love this...use it every day and am already a repeat purchaser.  Gives a dewy finish and any dry feeling you have disappears.
1025,1,"love outlast - throw balm away_have worn outlast for years and they keep discontinuing everything!  I like this 810 rose satin but have to frost over it myself with a fat pencil.  never use the balm, think it shortens the amazing long life of this stuff.  combo of shimmer pencil and color looks just the same 24 hours later.best colors of all are 547, 524, 800, and 566.  all discontinued with the price jacked up triple if you can find them at all. 810 is my 5th fave color - so snapped up this deal.remember the blue bottles?  they got it right the first time.  now they are into natural, flat and brown colors.  must be the in thing, but I want frost and color, sniff sniff"
59,1,"Love this color!_I love this color and have been using it for a couple of years. The conditioner which comes with it is excellent as lightening your hair this much, will dry it out badly without conditioning."
620,1,Nice 1600 watt Hair Dryer_Having fine hair I find the 1875 watt hair dryers a little too forceful to be able to style my hair while drying it so I was looking for a 1600 watt hoping that it would make a difference and it did. They are hard to find so I was really happy to find this one. It's nice lightweight and even comes with some styling tools.I personally couldn't be happier!
9881,1,"Amazing!_Great product!  Made an entirely huge difference on the look and feel of my skin! I really liked how the instructions were very easy to read and understand.  If you&#8217;re looking for softer healthier skin, this is the product to get!"
6634,1,3 Brushes_Fast shipping.  Good quality brushes.  I have seen this used a lot and after I received mine and used them I can see why.  I would certainly recommend these.
1687,1,Great Ylang Ylang_This Ylang Ylang is very concentrated and has a great smell but does not overpower since you don't need much. I added this to my homemade leave in treatment for my natural 4a hair and it helps keep it soft.
6611,0,"Buyer Beware!!_I was always curious about WEN and how it gave Chaz's models such great results. So, I decided to try it. I bought the Winter Vanilla Mint in December 2011 from QVC and regretted it ever since. I loss SO MUCH hair it wasn't funny (bald spots along the forehead/temporal areas and about 2-3 inches in length)! I noticed the hair loss immediately after washing my hair. It took well over a year just to grow back the hair I loss. However, I did read in one of QVC's reviews about another WEN Product (Fig Cleansing Conditioner) that the writer suffered 'mild hair loss' as well. I thought that since I bought the Vanilla Mint I would not have that problem. I thought wrong. The only explanation I could find from WEN is that I could be allergic to some of the ingredients in the shampoo. Also, that the hair I loss was not from the cleansing conditioner and just a part of normal hair shedding. All I can say is pay close attention to reviews and think before you buy."
5739,1,Four Stars_Thumbs up!
1527,1,nice stamping polish_Its a great thick consistency and works well with the other konad products! Definitely recommend it. I haven't tried other brands with my stamper yet but I feel like I don't have to since this one is tried and true and works so well!
7811,1,"Great make up brush set_This make up brush set is awesome, i love the color and they are very well made.  thank you so much =)"
8746,1,"Best concealer on the market!_I use several different foundations because my skin tone changes throughout the year, but this concealer crayon is my favorite for use with all of them.  It gives the best coverage and is the easiest to apply.  No mess, no smears, no fuss."
4700,1,"still trying it out_So I have not been using this product every week, I use it every other week,but I will start using it more to see results. It does peel off easily as indicated and right after my skin does feel baby soft and supple as if I just washed it for a long time so that's a plus. As far as toning and evening + brightning skin tone I still need to see about that. I am ok with it, but it should have been cheaper."
4109,1,"Defines your eyes_If you have the time and patience, this beats any pencil eyeliner. It does take a little practice and the brush is kind of hard, but it goes on so dark and rich.  Great product for the winged eye look that any woman can pull off.  It doesnt stay clean for full 8 hours, it will smudge after a long wear.  Cant beat the price"
408,0,just like many other products_Works ok but takes time....just like many other products. Nothing special
6580,0,Would Not Buy Again_I would never buy these again. I'll stick with China Glaze. Please note that this item in non-refundable. A few of my colors had faulty caps and dried out. Many other are too thick and goopy to apply properly. So in general the colors are gorgeous but most are impossible to use. I'll stick with the higher grade polishes form now on.
6940,1,"This is the real deal_This is the real Gucci guilty intense perfume. Smells exactly like the one in the store!!! My package was not open, was not tampered with and there is no strong alcohol smell. My older one has more of an alcohol smell than this one does and it's from Macy's. I love love love this scent. It's so sexy! Every time I wear it, men always ask me, &#34;what are you wearing?&#34;  I recommend you try this one in the store and if you love it, buy it here at a fraction of the department store price. Thank you amazon!"
5288,0,"Not as advertised_I used this product twice a day, everyday, until the tube was gone.  No results AND for sure not even close to what the pictures in the description.  Maybe the PICTURES haven't been &#34;altered&#34;, but the people must have been.  Not reordering."
2099,1,As I said b4_and I will say it again! I will never use another product other than EzFlow. It has been my all time easiest perfected product that I have ever found!
6886,1,Nice brushes_These seem to be fairly good brushes for the price. The fan brushes are a little delicate but other wise a fairly nice set. Shipping took quite a while and they do come in a plastic pouch and the smaller brushes all have plastic tubing to keep them from getting roughed up.
3361,1,I love this!_I bought a bunch of UV buffs and UV buff head bands for my vacation in Hawaii and wear them to my yoga classes and for running or just around town. They provide great sun protection and look really cute!
110,1,Great Oil_This oil moisturized great and was really silky going on and made my skin feel very silky as well and moisturized especially after showerin while skin is still damp. It smells like all cocoa butter products a chocolatey smell and it was a decent size bottle to last for a while. I love this oil
7113,1,great compact!_a super compact to have with mineral powders. works well. i have a couple of them. get one for yourself!
9135,0,Discontinued use because of sensitive skin reaction_This wasn't a product that worked for me.  I have sensitive skin and I started to break out with it.  I didn't use it long enough to see if the claims of dark spot reductions were true because of that issue I had with it.
6461,0,"Not for me_While Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer is indeed completely scentless, the amount of stearyl alcohol in the product reduces its ability to moisturize -- at least for my (older) skin.  I live in a very dry and windy state and so I do tend to need a rich moisturizer and do my best to avoid product that list any kind of alcohol in the first few ingredients.One thing I know about skin -- we are all different and our skins will always react differently to moisturizer.  However, I highly doubt that any woman in her 40s or older is going to find this product useful.I do feel as if the advertising for this lotion is attempting to describe it as different than most or special but as far as I can tell, there is nothing special in this and it does not seem to penetrate even as well as something like Curel does.I don't recommend this product --  but it may work well for some so if you can check it out with a sample, you can decide for yourself!"
2174,1,Excellent product_This lotion came in promptly and packaged well. I like it very much. It goes on easily and absorbs well. I especially like the fact that it doesn't have a lot of additives. I am very pleased.
1250,1,"good brush for skin brushing_it does hurt a little bit at first.  But I wasted $12 on a softer, bath type brush, and ended up throwing it away because it wasn't effective.  This does what it is supposed to, and for half the price I paid for the softer brush."
6459,1,Simple. . . non-greasy. .  .. nice moisturizer_I really like this moisturizer.  It's non-greasy. . . it doesn't have a pungent smell. .  .. it doesn't leave my face oily. . . it's reasonably priced. . . . nice consistency. . . . . Really nice overall product.  I look forward to trying other products by Simple.
6444,1,"Gorgeous!_I love the OPI Muppets Collection and this is one of my favorites! It's a gorgeous metallic light taupe, that you can easily wear any of the Muppets glitters over. Two coats over a base coat then a top coat, it lasts for over a week. This is one of the prettiest colors I've seen in a long time & I get many compliments on it!!"
3783,0,"Made my face bleed ):_Usually I love loreal but after using this I got pimples, bumps on my face, and backed up dry skin. This doesn't exfoliate well at all. It dries my skin out. I have pretty dry skin already but now that summers coming it's not really dry. Also it is rare that i get acne. I was putting my makeup on the other day and all around my nose and under my eye was so dry and just dead skin it was disgusting. Then I noticed blood coming out on the dry skin. It was awful and wouldn't stop. I will never use this again. I went back to my neutrogena exfoliator and put a mask on my skin and moisturizer and my skin is all better now so I know that it was this product that just ruined my skin. The idea of it is cool but nope not a good product in my opinion. I do love loreal but this product upset me so much"
9403,1,"SKIN SO SOFT!  : )_I Love this Youthful Advantage 4-n-1 Beauty Travel Spa Set W/ Case. Facial Brush i love how simple it is to use, and how it leaves my skin feeling so Refreshed. i always wanted a Brush like this. and i'm so very Glad that i finally took it upon myself to try one! and let me share how very please i am! Now i can pampered myself when ever i feel like, and in my own home! now how sweet is that??? : ) this wonderful Brush does a lot for your skin. leaving it looking so Radiant,And Soft! Improves overall skin tone and Deeply cleaning skin.  Thanks!  : )"
6188,0,"not for me_This product not any good for my skin, my skin dried out and make my skin itchy,and bump all over turned to  red. I bought this product becase I saw really good rating here.May be it's works to some people not for all.Specially not good  for sensitive skin"
752,1,"Fun Time_This is an excellent product, taking a bath is made more enjoyable with this product and i  would recommend this to any friend or family member.  Thank you"
250,1,"Great for dry skin!!!_I used this years ago when I was struggling with dry flaky skin on my face.  A friend bought this as a gift and helped get my face back into shape.  I found this product again and was surprised at how quickly it helps so much!  I use this with the Burt's Bees Carrot Nutritive Night Cream.  I've never been one for the strong Orange smell; however, I don't care, as long as my face gets better!"
6318,1,"Harmony Cuticle Oil_Love this cuticle oil, dissolves into cuticles quickly and not greasy at all....makes my cuticles look nourished and clean. Love."
7484,1,"Moisturizing_I do like this shampoo.  It is very moisturizing.  My hair is dry , so this is important.  The scent is definitely shea butter, just like the scent from shea butter hand and body lotions.  This scent does linger for more than a day.  So if you like the scent of shea butter and need a moisturizing shampoo, I recommend this one."
8367,1,"Best nail drier for gels or regular polish_I did my research when looking for a nail curer and dryer and am so happy I got this one. It is so versatile, i use the fan in it to dry my regular polish, and use the uv with the fan to feel my hands cool while i cure my gel polish. It has a timmer in it was starts at 2 min and goes all the way up to seven min. I've never experienced any problems with it and have owned it for about 6 months now. It came with extra bulbs but i havent needed to use them yet."
1200,1,AWESOME OIL!!!!_For hair and skin this gets an A+ it does not leave anything feeling oily or greasy at all. Nice very light smell to it.
8421,1,"Creamy and cleans well_Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control Nourishing Shampoo and thepaired conditionerboth are thick and creamy with a pleasant, sweet and non-offensive odor.  The shampoo does a good job cleaning the hair and the conditioner leaves it easy to comb and shiny when dry."
3842,1,"Great color, but hard to apply_Is the first time that i buy NYX products, the color of this product is great, includes was shaper too. But until now I don't know how to apply the powder, using the pincel is hard to apply."
465,1,God Sent_Lovvvvvvvveeeeeee love! I use this spray to set my makeup and honey child!!!! It works and makes your face look dewy and life like!!! Yasssssss I love it!!!!!
7235,1,Great nail tool!_My tween daughter used some of her birthday money to purchase these - she loves them and has fun painting detailed designs on her nails with these.
