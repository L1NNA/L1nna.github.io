5884,"The hair gods made this product_My hair: fine, dry, dyed along with having PCOS which makes hair even worseI've tried everything under the sun and moon. Some were good results. Nothing like with Carols Daughter. I got it as a sample from Ulta and thought, ehh what the heck. The sample barely gave any product. With my hair type, the more product the better! I used the sample anyway. A little goes a very long way. I literally used about the size of a quarter of the sampoo and conditioner. They spread through out my hair and was enough. I have shoulder length hair so someone with long hair would need a bit more. The conditioner made my hair feel very silky and soft. Even my husband commented on how my hair felt. I know that seems like BS, but believe me my husband isn't very observational when it comes to hair... or make up. Sometimes the man cant tell when im not wearing make up. -_- *sigh* When he can notice  a difference, theres an increadible difference. LolIt is a bit pricey, I know it sucks, but you get what you pay for with this product. I will never use another shampoo and conditioner.As a side note, I wear human hair clip I  extentions. I used the mask on them. They were very soft and hydrated. They didnt matt up, which is the sign of dry extentions. I'll continue to use the mask on the extentions and my own hair."
2849,"A self-tanning guru's new favorite_I am ADDICTED to being tan! However, the tanning bed is inconvenient, expensive, not to mention damaging. I have been using self-tanning lotions for over 2 years on a bi-daily basis. So I know what I mean when I say this lotion is EXCELLENT. It leaves a very faint/nonthreatening smell, which is unlike a lot of comparable tanning lotions. It is also very light/easily absorbing, so you will not feel greasy all day. It leaves you tan; DHA (which is the ingredient that actually tans you)is listed second in the ingredients, so it is pretty potent, but not in an unnatural way. I highly recommend this product!For best results:*Apply after showering/bathing*When tanning feet, use very sparingly and mix with regular moisturizer for best results. NEVER apply this lotion to the bottoms/soles of your feet. EVER!*When tanning hands, also mix with regular moisturizer and use a baby wipe to get in between fingers to prevent discoloration*Apply directly to face at night after washing your face (I have never had a problem with eyebrows discoloring, but avoid contact just in case)*Use every 2 daysEnjoy!"
6573,Nice_So Im not sure if there is 7400 in this set but they are beautiful and unlike some of the other reviews mine didnt come all mixed together.
4480,"Can't get over how good this curling iron is!!!_I am looking at my bone straight hair once again-looks like it was done by a professional thanks to this Babybliss Pro. I have very thick hair and with other curling irons, it still would have that bushy, fuzzy look even after several passes. However, I crank this iron up on high and one pass is all I need to create a salon similar look. Love it, love it LOVE IT!!!!!"
1642,Best soap ever!_I am very dark skinned and - for those of you in the know - that means ash central after showering...BUT NOT WITH THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I don't even need to moisturize anymore!  And yet it's not greasy and you feel clean after using it.  Miracle of miracles.
8368,"Sticky_I didn't care for this gloss.  The color is nice and the texture.  But once it's on, it feels sticky."
3221,YES!_I loved mine so much that I purchased this one for my sister who also fell in love with it. This product is brilliant and every woman who has hair should buy it. Nough said.
5274,"A waste_I saw this being reviewed in a magazine. It said it was good.  I did not particularly care for it.  I have found better products to control my 'white girl' frizz. Was disappointing, especially for the price for such a small amount."
3583,"Works very well_Great for carrying in your purse. Gives you an opportunity to use the perfume out of that big bottle that's sitting at home.Occasionally, this product will have some trouble with stubborn perfume bottle nozzle."
5252,"Don't believe the negative reviews..._Weirdos. I think what happened was they bought it online and it was old. I've been reading a lot of reviews on mascara on amazon and it seems like that's the case usually. Seller sells the old mascara! So just buy at the nearest supermarket, that's all. Usually cheaper there anyway. Also, u can easily return the item when u don't like it. :)So I did google search...what's the best waterproof mascara. This was the top #3. The top #1 and 2 were too expensive lol.Also, when I youtubed wedding makeup and other makeup tutorial, many of them recommended l'oreal voluminous (waterproof) mascara. So I think that says a lot.Anyway I got this at HEB last night for less than $6 and I tried this on today and worked out at the gym.No smudging, no raccoon eyes (seriously, I think those people who wrote the negative reviews wore different mascara lol) and comfortable, no irritation!What I like about this mascara is it does not come off heavy, keeps my lashes curled up, soft and pretty! I'm going to use it for my wedding ceremony this Saturday!!!"
494,Yes!_Smells awesome and it does not make your hair oily. My husband and I love it. We both use it.
4833,Great color_Awesome grey/silver color with sparkles.  The actual color on the bottle does not do any justice.  Two coats was a perfect shade
5439,"Soft skin_Love this and will reccomend. The first thing I noticed was how good it smells, like a grapefruit,citrus.My skin was much softer and the tone was 'sunkissed' like the bottle says. There isnt streaking.Its nice if your keeping a tan or want a boost without a deeper tan. I use this almost daily and on occasion I use banana boat and use this to extend it. Great stuff,I'd look for a sale."
3127,"Ageless Essentials_The name of the product is pretty captivating, Ageless Essentials. Most people would like to look a little younger and I'm no different.I don't think it will do much for my deeper wrinkles, but it reads that it 'significantly smoothes the appearance of fine lines' and I hope it does. Two nights application isn't enough time for me to determine if that's true.It does have a light perfumed scent, but that fades away quickly after applying it. Still I think it would be nicer without any scent. That's just my own opinion though."
3713,"Great iron_I was searching for a quality iron after my old (and cheap) Revlon went out.  I decided since I was beginning a new  journey towards healthier hair, I would invest in a quality professional straightening iron to (hopefully) straighten my hair with less damage.  I had purchased and returned two irons prior to taking a chance on the Solia and I am so happy that I did.  What I like most about this iron is that you don't need high temperatures to get the hair straight (unlike cheaper or drugstore brands).  I comfortably straighten my transitioning 4a/b African-American hair at a temperature no higher than 360 degrees.  The plates heat evenly and I have no problems curling under or creating flips.  Though I've only had this iron for seven months, it seems to be well-made and I suspect I'll have this iron for a long time to come."
6781,"Great product - Better price than most_My supervisor at work has coarse hair - yet she manages to keep it in very nice condition.  I asked her what shampoo and conditioner she uses and she said Joico K-Pak.  I have been using the same - along with the oil - for nearly a year now and I have to say my colored, coarse, aging hair feels very nice and is in wonderful condition!  And, with these products the price is better that many of the other quality salon brands."
5287,"Excellent_Its a good primer for make up and intensify the color, good quality, and perfect to carry on your purse"
3816,A great palette to have_Great warm colors.  I found that I use this palette more than I thought that I would.  I even can use a lot of the colors on my 12 year old daughter and they don't look too dark at all. I got this palette on Ebay ( it was a lot cheaper there ) and it is something that I would buy again. :)
8841,"Works Great!_I've just recently gone the way of gelish nail polish and decided that I could save myself some money and do my own nails.  I bought this LED nail dryer and some gelish polish ........ and from the first time I used them, my nails have looked like they were done in the salon.  This LED nail dryer is large enough for your whole hand to fit in, but I do my fingers first and my thumb separately.  You can set it for 10, 30, or 60 second drying time.  I do the base coat and 2 layers of gelish nail polish on the 30 second setting and for the top coat, I put my nails in the LED nail dryer for 60 seconds.  If I use a darker gelish nail polish, I put my nails in the LED nail dryer for 60 seconds for both coats/layers.The LED nail dryer is also automatic ..... once you turn it on, all you have to do is insert your fingers and it automatically comes on and shuts off according to what setting you chose (10, 30,60 seconds).The price of the LED nail dryer is the equivalent of 2 nail salon visits ............ I've already gotten my money's worth out of it.  I can't begin to add up how much money having my own LED nail dryer will save me .....I HIGHLY recommend this product."
5174,eyebrow tint_this is a wonderful product. It coved the grey in my eyebrows. I highly recommend this product.  The product is easy to apply and remove
616,"The One and Only_The Present is in a class by itself!  I have never seen a facial product do more!  After applying sunscreen and/or moisturizer, apply The Present.  This product will make your foundation (preferably philosophy airbrush canvas) go on smoothly, and makes it adhere to your skin.  Your skin is smoothed out filling in lines and wrinkles, as well as large pores.  It is just the greatest product ever. Sharon Perkins, Cordele, GA"
47,"excellent moisturizer_I'm 35 years old (soon to be 36) and I generally stay out of the sun, so I don't have to worry about wrinkles yet!  However, I'd like to KEEP my skin looking youthful, and I know that I do get some sun exposure just from doing everyday things like walking the dog or driving to work.  Also, several older relatives (70s and 80s) have had a basal cell skin cancer on their faces.  I figure if I start working on prevention NOW, when I reach that age, I'll be less likely to develop the same problem.Furthermore, I've been using some rather harsh salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide treatments lately, and these are drying to my skin.  Ideally, I wanted a moisturizer with some sun protection that could also help keep my skin from drying out.  This moisturizer was a quick (i.e., without any research), off-the-shelf purchase at a local drugstore.  I have not used any Olay products in the past.This product seems to be doing an excellent job, so far.  While I can't predict what will happen in 5 or 10 years, I'm very happy with the day-to-day benefits of using this moisturizer.  I put this on in the morning before going to work and wash my face again about 10 hours later.  During that time, my face does not look oily at all.  Further, I have sensitive skin and I don't notice any redness or irritation.  Also, this product does not have a fragrance to it (fragrances are particularly irritating to my skin).  So it truly is good for MY sensitive skin.One problem I have often had in the past due to dry skin is that when I dye my hair, the dye gets sucked into my skin and leaves purple stains on my forehead (I have a pale complexion and I dye my hair black).  I end up looking ridiculous for a couple of days.  I've had one hair appointment so far since I started using this moisturizer, and my skin is much less dry -- few to no purple stains on my forehead this time!I also think my skin is pretty soft since I've been using this, and I have not had any additional or unusual breakouts (the package says it is non-comedogenic), so that's nice, as well.  For what it's worth, it's easy to put on makeup (i.e., foundation) after applying this moisturizer.  Finally, you should know that a little goes a long way -- it really does not take much to get full coverage of your face; I expect the bottle to last a long time.Wow, I don't normally gush about skincare products this much.  I guess this is one of those rare cases when I really can't think of anything I don't like about the product.  At any rate, I'd definitely recommend this moisturizer."
2049,wife said it was awesome and was vey happy with it_wife said it was awesome and was vey happy with it. Can only recommend for skin that isn't oily or dry.
1204,"It is good_It goes on with a little color to guide you , I use it with my fake bake application mitt and I just take a lot of time to get it even. The good thing about it is that it won't leave a heavy residue like fake bake , just a tiny bit comes off the next morning when you shower . It gives me the perfect shade of sun kissed and it sure outlast all others I tried . Make sure you do your due diligence exfoliating in the shower , I use my Moroccan mitt for that , dry off and start applying the lotion as if it was your body lotion. It smells like cherries , is easy to rub on and in and it doesn't streak if put on evenly. Hence get an applicator mitten . No need to wear gloves under the one I got , just wash the mitten out after every use and then wash your hands well and you good to go. the tan is build-able to your desired shade and it lasts the week. You can reapply without exfoliating if you want a tough up on your arms and shoulder or legs.... All in all it's good for the prize and I will certainly buy it again."
839,"Four Stars_TIENE MUY BUEN AROMA, ME ENCANTO EL REGALO QUE HICE."
8589,"Wonderful Shaver to Go_I have been using the Schick Hydro shavers since they came out.  I travel alot and don't want to accidentally leave it in the hotel room, so I'm very excited to have this new disposal shaver with all of the same qualities.  Try it, you won't go back."
4012,"This is garbage!_I am fairly new to these conditioning cleansers and have tried many over the past few months.  A friend gave me a couple travel packets of Wen, and I loved it!  So, I thought I would try another brand, just in case I love it as well and then I could save some money.  NO, NO, NO!  I did not love this product, I hate this product.  The smell is atrocious and this left my hair stiff.  I immediately re-washed my hair and threw this junk in the trash where it belongs.  I ordered two bottles of Wen and I am now happy using Wen."
2880,Great except..._On one set of stickers the design was very worn and smudged. Otherwise I LOVE THESE!! The designs are beautiful!!
2498,"Horrible_I tried it twice! Not impressed! First time I used it, it smeared like crazy, so I waited a couple of days and tried it again over another nail polish and as a base coat. This stuff really 't'd me off! Not only does it not dry well, it smears like crazy and takes days to dry. Even after a couple of days wear it still get marks in my nails. If it didn't cost so much for shipping it back, I would but it's not worth it. I'll just toss it and never order CHINA GLAZE products again. Horrible stuff."
3635,"Super Gentle and Doesn't Run into Eyes_Like many, I've had a hard time finding an eye creme that's effective, yet gentle and doesn't run into my eyes and sting. This is it! The whole Healthy Skin line is excellent.Just a dab of this creme is really enough and feels very soothing and nice. Too soon to know if it's working on lines yet, but the point is that no one can even find that out if the creme is any good if you can't use it regularly because it stings. THIS stuff I can use! It's so gentle, I WANT to use it every day and night.Simple, effective, pure."
4112,"My new love!_So I'm in love with these brushes. I originally bought it as a gift for a friend and fell completely in love for it. Now I am buying all kits for myself and an extra one for another friend.These don't shed at all!!! I've been using it for about a month and it looks new! I also own the Coastal Scents Kit and let me tell you, these are faaar better. Far better than even MACs and other brands you find in Sephora. Totally worth the money!The mirror is HUUUUGE for pocket size, so I walk with it everywhere!I have 2 complains, though. I feel like for this kit, an angle brush is seriously missing. Also that the clutch feels kind of cheap. But the brushes completely pay off for any negative point!I posted pictures!LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! s2"
6878,Great_These brushes are perfect for nail art!! It came with so many different kinds that I can do just about anything :) I would definitely recommend these brushes and also the seller (UnitedMail).
750,"Not what I expected from Sally Hansen_I bought this because it can be used for a base and top coat. The first 5 times I used it it worked fine. But, not it is very gloopy and thick so it is very hard to use. So disappointing. When I now use it as a top coat it forms little air bubble on the surface of my manicure. All the other Sally Hansen brands are pretty good. In fact, Sally Hansen extreme is my favorite drugstore polish. Not buying again."
7011,Love Pink!!!_I ordered these first and foremost because of the color! The brushes are very soft. They do smell a bit but I know that will go away once I remove them from the bag and packaging. I would repurchase this as a gift for a friend or relative.
1761,amazing!! i love it!!_this is the most amazing bronzer ever! its not too heavy and gives a nice little glow to my face
7514,"Good_They were on time, exactly 45 pcs, a little bit of variety in color.... overall I was satisfied they're what I was looking for."
9136,"Great product!!_I really do love this cream, I don't have alot of things to cover up so this is a nice lightweight cover cream. It has a smooth feel to it and goes on well. I would recommend it highly but then again I don't think I have ever had a bad product from Ponds."
4942,"Lots of Qtips_These are same Qtips that you would buy in a store, and these are a great price. Just be prepared to hoard 2 extra boxes of Qtips in your closet for a few months. This is probably a 1 year supply."
4097,Love_Love the color and the price.  It goes on smooth and doesn't look heavy. I would recommend this lipstick to anyone
7565,"GIVING WEN A SERIOUS RUN FOR THE MONEY!!_All this cleansing conditioner needs is slip, and it could take over the world.  It's just that good!  The smell is like candy, the clean is perfection, and the curl definition on my 3b/c hair is miraculous!  When you first put it in your hair, it feels like it's going to be a waste of time...but just let it sit in there for 15 minutes.  My hair felt like SILK!!  And it was Moist, and soooo soft.  I haven't even finished the first bottle, and I ordered another 4.  And now I'm ordering 3 more!!PS.  I'm just going to add cones to it myself, and give it the same slip that Wen has (Wen contains cones).  Then I'll never have another bad day Again!!"
5427,"Does what it does_it's name brand and functions pretty simple. It really can't do any wrong can it? It's cute and pink and it works just fine. I got the double ended one too so i can aim better when doing smaller stamps because this one if biggish for tiny decals. Over the years, the silicone pad can go in a little far when pressing down but nothing that makes it function terribly. No complaints here really."
2912,"100% Pure Body Cream - Coconut_I already use the hand cream, and I love the smell of it so I bought the body cream. This not only smells great, but when I use it and then wash my hands, I don't feel like I have to use more lotion."
1705,"Repairs-but not instantly_I have tried many leave in conditioners with varying levels of satisfaction. Some promise heat protection, splint end repair, color preservation, or softness-it is difficult to find a product that helps with all of them. Pureology Instant Repair surprisingly helps with most of them.Although my hair is not color treated, and rarely exposed to heated styling tools-it is still exposed to the weather elements which can hurt it and break it. After using Pureology along side a laundry list of other products-my hair is shedding less, easier to detangle, less frizzy and shiny. This did not happen over night, I have to use Pureology consistently or my hair starts shedding again. I believe this is one of the biggest contributing products because it offers UV protection and seems to spread very evenly over hair.The product is clear and feels more like a hair gel as opposed to a creamy leave in conditioner. It has a more 'masculine' scent, but I enjoy this and it doesn't stay in hair for long. I apply when my hair is wet and have no trouble spreading it through to every strand.Hair Type: Wavy to curly, fine stranded, damaged dry ends with split ends, frizzy, greasy roots (occasionally), lightened (blonde)"
3078,"Very quality hair tool_I had the Sally Hansen Generic Value Product flat iron previously because it was recommended as a knock-off CHI.  It did a decent job for the price (around $60).  Then it gave out after about two and a half years of straightening goodness.So I shopped Amazon and based on the reviews, bought this.  This is so nice.  From the luxurious red silky bag to the HSI oil sample, you could tell it was all quality.  The iron is much more substantial feeling and heats up very fast.  It does the job well and I believe it could be an over $200 iron.  What a deal!"
731,Best non-tan tan._Use this at night along with the micromist spay tan. Spray first then this to moisturize and help darken the tan. Leaves a even tan that doesn't scream artificial orange.
1474,"Original Scent Dry Skin Moisturizer_Love the pump and keep it by my kitchen sink so I am always reminded to moisturize my hands, especially after doing the  dishes! Love the almond cherry scent and it really softens my hands and skin without being greasy."
8552,Soothing bath_This soap not only smells great and provides for a soothing scent during a shower but also leaves ones skin feeling clean refreshed and soft. It has a soft sweet scent that is not overbearing but simply perfect for any woman. (Draupadi Beloved)
1023,"I have fine, (very) damaged hair and I love it!_I love love love this dryer! I have blond, overprocessed, long, fine hair and this dryer leaves it so smooth! I can't believe it! It dries my hair in five minutes, compared to twenty minutes with my old dragon dryer (you know the one, practically spits fire and weighs a ton!).  This does blow fast, even on low, but that is the great thing about it! The dryer is so LIGHT! 14.8 ounces to be exact! I just can't tell you enough about why I love it! The shipping was free, and the price was half what it is in the store.  If you have fragile hair, this is for you. If you have thick hair, this is for you. If you have frizzy hair, fine hair, any hair.. well you get the idea!"
9999,"This is a nice product that smells good and leaves your skin feeling ..._This is a nice product that smells good and leaves your skin feeling soft and refreshed. I would recommend it to someone looking for an inexpensive way to improve their overall skin.I do at times get free product/discounts in exchange for reviewing a product. However, this does not alter my opinion of the review and I do not get paid for this."
6156,Two Stars_THESE THINGS ARE SO SMALL YOU CAN BARLY HOLD THEM IN YOUR HANDS
1923,Like it a lot_Good as advertised. Can notice the difference in my hair. Makes my hair softer and shinier. Very good item. Will purchase again.
6753,"Received broken :(_Pro: shipped quickly looks nice, low priceCons: the black broke and ruined the rest of the colors, now they all are hinted with black, I even tried to wipe them off.  Doesnt show up well, have to use a lot of the lighter colors to see them. Olive-tan skin tone"
7505,Two Stars_This stuff was processed. It smelled somewhat sterile. I was not a fan.
8903,Finally!!!_I learned about this product from YouTube. I was looking for a way to wash away all of the makeup from my brushes. This simple to use glove made it simple & saves me a lot of time. I highly recommend it .
5345,"Great setting powder_This powder keeps me matte longer than any other.  I have tried others but I have come back to this one.  It doesn't leave a white cast on me (I am very fair though) as long as I pat it on and then knock off the excess.  It doesn't take much at all.  I  can't compare it to MUFE as I have never tried their hd powder, but I can say that with this I feel no need to try MUFE."
1752,"disappointed_I don't think I will purchase this again....too oily for me, and doesn't do very good job either. I'd better stick with my old cleansing oil"
3776,"jo jo east baltimore_Nice received it lightning fast!!!  It is a good primer if you use just a little bit!  I didn't know this until I talked to some African American women, redness can occur from light skin Caucasians to Medium Skinned African Americans, I believe coastal scents has a darker green corrective for darker skins,!  This is nice and it does what it claimed to do, without making me look like a green monster!"
1050,"HAIR  COLOR_HAVE TRIED VARIOUS SHADES OF NUTRISSE, FAIRLY GOOD MATCH TO ACTUAL PRODUCT SHOWN ON BOX.  GENTLE ON THE HAIR  JUST WISHED IT LASTS LONGER...."
6074,"My curls stay!!!!_I bought this to curl my human hair lace wigs so that I can give my hair a break and voila, it works wonders. Before using this I couldn't get curls to stay in longer than a couple of hours now they stay in for at least 3 days. The only thing is this product has alcohol in it and is very drying to the hair. But in my opinion it is a great product."
1176,EASY BLEND_Blend better than hand and brush on face. It make my face very smooth and natural looking. I recommend for everyone.
8056,"Comfortable in the tummy_I buy this for my mom who likes to take her vitamin B but her tummy cannot handle some of the other brands.  These sit nicely in her tummy.  Yep, a quality product good enough for a fussy mom."
4444,"love it !_this is my all time favorite facial cleanser. it cleans and moisturizes at the same time, I hardly ever have to use moisturizer. this is great for aging skin."
2106,"Christmas Gift_This stuff smells great and I bought it for someone who likes it but was going to buy it at a department store that was more expensive.  I love Amazon.com as I hate to shop and although I wanted to buy a smaller bottle, this was a great deal for a great price!"
2201,Amazing._This works very well when straightening my hair. It leaves it silky smooth. It protects from heat. It's a very good product.
2853,"Average_Spectrum Extra Virgin Organic and Garden of Life Organic coconut oils are far superior to this. Amazon indicates it comes in a jar, but it does not. It's plastic. I would recommend this oil for body therapy only."
7250,Great!_The scent is out of this world. Mmmm.... I love this product. Keeps my skin so soft. My boyfriend can't keep his hands off of me.
1638,"soft and smooth_I really like this facial cream.I am now using the hand and body on my face as well.The hand and body has a higher concentration of AHA's.I reccomend starting with the facial cream, then move to the hand and body lotion after your skin gets used to the concentration of AHA's."
7873,Lots of great colors to choose from_Get lots of compliments on my nails whenever I wear these rhinestones. I love that there are so many different colors and that they are so shiny! Mmmm...sparkly.
9771,"Very Good Product_I use this at night for a home mix to help my eyelashs and eyebrows. It work great. I can throw the one I use away each night and keep things nice and clean. My home mix goes on easy. Will probably buy again when this supply runs out. Another winner, Amazon."
3666,"Creamy and Smooth, but Bleeds_I have this in two colors, Red Revival and Mauve Me. I don't love the color of the mauve one, I feel it doesn't... pop. It's a little dull. The Red Revival is gorgeous though! Beautiful perfect shade of red! It's very very smooth and glides right on. Your lips feel luxurious with it on, velvety. It is not drying at all. Staying power is pretty great. Even after I eat lunch it's about 60% still there, I don't fully reapply, just a touch up with a lip brush.Pros:Hydrating, non drying formulaGreat textureGreat staying powerLovely light scentCons:It gets Everywhere!!! If your lip even thinks about touching something, it's going to get red on it (the mauve wasn't as bad, but it still did it)It bleeds (the mauve did not bleed though) I have to use a reverse lip pencil"
6688,"Don't Buy!!!_I bought this wig once and I liked it until on the 3rd day of me wearing it the straps both fell off, i thought it would be ok. So it wont be as snug as i want it.... that night went to take it off and the front and back fell apart!!!! I messaged them and told them they offered me a refund or to ship out another one... So i opted for another one. November 20 it was shipped, here it is Dec 21st and still NO WIG!!! Don't do it! Go somewhere else to get your product if you want to receive you product and a quality product! I did receive a refund, that's the only thing good that came out of this!"
295,"Nice product_I like this hair spray.  Holds my upswept hair without being too &#34;hard&#34; and yet does the job.  I like their Super hold, too, for a couple of recalcitrant spots at the nape of my neck."
8121,"B-E-A-UTIFUL_I love this wig so much. I also bought it in pink and I love it.My only problem with it is that it tangles pretty easy, but I have a wig comb so its not a big deal to me.Quick tip: no wig comb? use a teasing brush or a hair pick and brush from the bottom."
9274,"Spa feel!_My hair is extremely curly and dry, and tends to look like steel wool - particularly when humidity is high. I found this product quite effective in removing the knots and tangles, and it worked for the entire day (which may seem an odd statement - but those with many curls will take my meaning.) It is not the best product for 'scrunching' - I would have preferred more fullness. One must experiment to get the precise amount to use - enough to remove tangles, but not enough to weigh down the hair. The fragrance and packaging is very attractive, and gives a luxurious sense that is delightful.Though it is too expensive for daily use, and may not be sufficient for both conditioning and styling, it is very worthwhile."
4382,Terrible_I thought buy buying Paul Mitchell would be a good buy. This hair die is horrible. I would not buy. It made my hair brassy. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
8066,GREAT PRICE_I BIUGHT THIS PACK FOR A GIFT AND THEY LOVE IT THEY SAID THAT THEY WHERE ALL THE RIGHT RED'S AND PACKAGING WAS GREAT AND OF COURSE FOR ME THE PRICE WAS GREAT AND EVEN GOT ONE FOR MY SELF
4734,Great buffing brush_I use this with my mineral foundation and I love it. There is no fall out so far and I just saw Sigma coming out with two more brushes! LOVE
661,Save your money_After reading reviews I really thought this one was going to be the one for me. Instead it did nothing. It does smell good. Sort of clean scent. I used it 5 times and almost 1/2 the bottle is gone.
7655,"Don't waste your money!!_Don't be fooled by the very pretty and tidy looking picture in the ad...that's not what you'll receive! I got a clear plastic bag full of the 12 little plastic pots that were covered with glitter. It looked like a fairy exploded inside the bags...but not one of the pots were open or broken, so they were packed that way. If that wasn't bad enough some of the pots aren't even a quarter of the way full.In the 12 pack I received:2 golds1 red1 dark pink1 light pink2 blues3 blacks1 silver1 green gold color...Nothing like the pretty colors you see in their photo!!!DON'T DO IT!! EVEN FOR THE PRICE...NOT WORTH IT!!"
5504,"So far so good..._27MARCH11--------->Okay, after reading others' reviews, I decided to give it a go-go. First off, I'm going to edit this for the next week so cut me some slack. (: I take hair really seriously so I hope this review helps others that really care for their hair too. *WARNING* OH. & I like to use a lot of humor, so if you're easily offended easily, please don't read my reviews. Any of them.***My hair has been permanently straightened (4 weeks ago) by Bio Ionic...yeah...it didn't make it super straight like it should have...because my hair dresser didn't leave the stuff in long enough; it only took away the puffiness. (We got in a deep conversation & she forgot to time it & after she put the last application of product in, she immediately washed it instead of waiting like 12 min like she should have...>_> there goes [...]....)I'm half japanese half white so I have Asian mixed with white people hair. Its naturally slightly wavy, but puffy (& annoying). I get up every morning to straighten my hair on the highest heat, but I use Moroccan oil (the original) & it works amazing. Because of my ugly, weird, & rare hair colour, I dye my hair black once every 2 months. You might think my hair is damaged badly, but its in good shape. I use Kpak reconstructor once a week, 10 Minute Miracle after every shower, I never blow dry my hair, & I eat pretty healthy & take pre-natals. SO. To sum it all up, my hair was damaged because of the Bio-Ionic & now I'm doing this. Lets see how it turns out.----------->Day 1: In the shower, I used Suave Naturals Daily Cleansing to get rid of all the crap that was in the hair. Then I used the 'step 1' pre-shampoo & washed the !@#$ out of my hair using half the packet. I put on a shower cap & continued with my shower needs. Then I removed the shower cap & rinsed my hair clean. Afterwards, I put my hair in a towel to get that '80%' dampness. I put on the gloves & applied the Keratin stuff. I over saturated. For some reason I thought I was dying my hair...LOL. Oh well, nothing happened so I set my microwave timer for 30 min & just read reviews of this stuff on Amazon. (: Btw, my hair was incredibly waxy. Yuck.When time was up, I blow-dryed my hair, not using a round brush or anything, just blow drying & making sure its straight by giving it a few brushes here & there. I used a regular plain Chi I bought from Costco (I believe its automatically on the highest settings; there is only an on & off switch...) & straightened the !@#$ out of my hair. The smell wasn't as bad as some people in their reviews said, but it was tolerable. When people say 'IT SMELLS REALLY BAD' I figured it smells really bad like a kid throwing up pizza. THAT smells bad. Not this. Smells kinda like candy! Lol. At that point, my hair felt really waxy. I figured it was because I over saturated it. So I kept straightening it until everything was smooth as water. I did notice that my hair did get lighter. Not a lot, but I have a sorta rare hair colour so it because a little bit more normal. Haha. My hair is a dirty-ash black. It was now a tinted-darkish-brownish colour. After awhile, the waxy kinda went away (ugh this is gonna suck for the next 48 hours), but it was still kinda waxy. I'll update this when I wash it. (=----------------->OKAY! back! After I washed it & all that jazz, my hair did dry a little faster than it normally would. Oh, I did not use the recommended shampoo & conditioner. I used the Say Yes to Tomatoes daily volume. After my hair dried, my hair was very soft, silky, & frizz free! My hair did get much more straight than what it should have been but there was a very tiny 'wave' that I was hoping to get rid of. I guess my hair really wants to be kinda wavy. But its no big deal because for the most part, it was straight & frizz free.I really like this product & I'm hoping my hair will stick like this without the use of the recommended shampoo & conditioner. I used only half of each, the pre-wash & the keratin treatment. I marked what date I used the product & I'll come back to this review when my hair starts to lose the product & let you guys know how many days it lasted for me.The only problem i encountered which was very very very minor, but I feel obligated to tell yall is...yes, it did make my hair lighter like many of other reviewers had said. I originally had dark ethnic asian hair which has been dyed black & my hair came out about 2 shades lighter into the brown. Still dark, but brown. Not black. And the last is you need to deep condition/re-strengthen your hair (ESPECIALLY THE ENDS). I'm very anal about how healthy my hair is & I noticed my hair has been a little bit more weak. Don't let the frizz-free & super silky-soft fool you. My ends are in a not-so-good condition, but its not terribly bad. Just avoid some high heat for a week; give your hair time to re-strengthen (this is common sense but all of you should be using heat protectant product when using heated tools!! (: just making sure!).Other than that, this is a pretty cool product. I'm glad they came out with something less than [...] for a product that can save sooo much time. If any of you have even thought to yourself something like, 'Oh man, I totally want to go to the lake/pool/beach/aquatic/humid area, but I don't my hair getting wet because it will get puffy/frizzy/curly/what-ever...etc etc' then I highly recommend you to use this product. (=10APRIL11 - I've noticed my hair is falling out more & more. :/"
374,"Gorgeous if you're pale_And I'm pale, thus the 5*'s for 'Orgasm'.  This is a pricey blush but I haven't been able to find a suitable duplicate in any other brand that matches the blend-ability, wear-ability and the pretty pinky-peach slightly shimmering shade that looks very natural on my ghostly skin.  I should also note that I am a klutz of the highest order and have lost numerous blushes when they've slipped out of my hands and hit the tile floor.  This blush has miraculously stayed intact despite numerous hard drops and I have to credit that to the nice packaging it is encased within.  I highly recommend this shade to klutsy, pale folks or those looking for just a hint of color."
2712,"Hoping for more relief of dry skin..._The scent is absolutely wonderful, refreshing ad eye opening in the morning. It rinses cleanly and I am hoping with continued use I will see the skin refreshment and nourishment as advertised. I have terribly dry skin in the winter and love the way this rinses easily without the oily feeling but have yet to see much relief for my dry skin. If I see improvement I will be trying many of the other scents as well."
6489,Simple and Refreshing_Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel is a easy product to like.  It cleans my face without causing any irritation and doesn't take much effort to put on or rinse away.  I like how it doesn't leave any noticeable residue on my face afterwards and instead makes my skin feel clean and fresh.  It has mild aroma and my skin does not dry out from using it repeatedly.
1833,"Hands down, Best Shampoo ever made!!_My mom is over 65 and she has thinning hair and very sensitive scalp. This is the only shampoo that has worked for her to prevent dryness and irritated itchy scalp feeling. I,m 31 and have baby thin hair so my hair is sensitive and many shampoos cause dandruff and dryness. This shampoo works wonders for me as well. Though you have to rinse for a good while because it leaves this waxy oily feeling on my roots and ends but other than that, the results are great."
4482,"Love, Love, Love_First time using it left my hair feeling so healthy and soft.  My hair was starting to feel more like straw to me with all of the heat syling I used on an almost daily basis.  This reversed that damage and restored my hair to better-than-ever condition.  It also left a lasting smell that is nothing less than WONDERFUL!!!  I'm going to make this last and won't be without it from here on!"
1908,"Great stuff_I have very sensitive skin, and this is the only thing I can use to wash my face. Very gentle. I wish it were more &#34;natural&#34; but hey, it works."
1133,"Love it_I'm a huge DevaCurl fan. I only have &#34;swavy&#34; hair as they classify it, but nothing brings out the potential of my hair like DevaCurl does. I was using regular DevaCurl, but my mom accidentally ordered me DevaCare, which is the same company, but DevaCare is so much creamier and just awesome."
9297,"Wonderful Silky Feel_I began using Vitamin C serums for my skin about 6 months ago. I can honestly say that it has made the biggest difference in my skin above anything that I have ever used. I had been using a serum that is more liquid in texture and needs to be refrigerated to keep it's freshness. It has actually made my skin look less wrinkled and lightened some age spots that I had.The Vidi Vitamin C20 seems to be an alternative to the kind that I had been using if you don't want to mess with having to keep it refrigerated. The type that I had been using is in a dark colored bottle with an eye dropper for application. The Vidi is in a pump bottle that requires no refrigeration.Vidi Vitamin C20 contains 20% vitamin C with Vitamin A and C. It also has salicylic acid and glycolic acid which is both good for the skin as well. It also contains dimethicone which is an ingredient that is found in many beauty products including hair products. I think that is the ingredient that gives this a silky feeling. It does feel wonderful on your skin. It glides on and makes my skin feeling silky all over.Vitamin C is one of the few over the counter products that have actually been shown to make a difference in the skin. It helps produce collagen, restores and regenerates skin and fights free-radicals.When using Vitamin C, you should use sunscreen. You should also not use Vitamin C products at the same time that you use Retinol products. I use my Vitamin C in the morning and my Retinol at night. The two products work against each but both very effective.~ I was provided a sample product for review."
4798,"Awesome Curling Wand_Was looking for a curling wand, found this one. My hair is super straight naturally and I always had a hard time keeping it curled. For the price, you can't get better than this. The curls come out great, last long, and the heat protection glove was super nice at first. You just have to be very careful and pay attention so you don't burn yourself! Absolutely love it and it has held up well."
118,"Like it a lot..._I like this mask a lot. I wanted something a little less drying than my purifying mint mask and since this has avocado in it I thought it would be a nice alternative. It's very nice and applies easily and my skin feels softer after I use it without feeling like it's stripped me of all moisture. Don't get me wrong, it's not the same effect as using a moisturizer or anything - you're still going to lose some moisture - but it's not nearly as drying as some masks I've used before."
4662,"Great for my sensitive, pregnant-lady skin_My skin became very sensitive and prone to break outs during my pregnancy.  I had to go back to oil-free makeup and moisturizers and had some really frustrating experiences with oil-free products just not doing the job and drying out my skin.  I was so relieved when I stumbled upon this product! It is so light but it really does the job.  I use it during the day under my makeup and at night before I go to bed.  It really does feel refreshing, to steal from the label.  There can be a sticky feeling if you use too much so you have to learn how much you really need for your skin. I don't have to use much at all and the jar has lasted me a long time. It can also give a slight wet feeling (for lack of a better term) when you first apply it but it sets in very quickly and that feeling goes away.  I have had much less issues with dry skin since I started using this and it has not irritated my skin at all."
7423,"nice shampoo_nice shampoo. does a nice job in repairing and nourishing the hair.  I found it very easy on my hair. Lathered well, and rinsed out well--leaving no residual on my hair. Nice smell as well."
3437,"Nice, not greasy and easily absorbed_I found this cream to work very well.  Its absorbed into the skin quickly and leaves no greasy residue, and so far as I can tell it has given me good sun protection."
4532,"My hair is thick and curls, but you can also use this to flatten your hair_I am a natural blonde with very thick fine hair.  This product conditions my hair so the curls aren't so frizzy and almost go into tendrils (prettier than it sounds)  but if I happen to flatten my hair, then the conditioner works with that too.  The scent is about the same as other Pantene products, sort of an neutral fresh scent.  It didn't feel heavy or my hair or leave any greasiness but I tend to rinse off with very warm or hot water followed by a cool rinse, so maybe that helps not leave residue on the hair."
662,"SMELLS GREAT AND WORKS WONDERS..._My stylist uses this on my hair (fine, jaw length and highlighted twice a year) and it's a very nice shampoo."
5293,"It actually works!  Really!_I am a skeptic, I would never buy 'anti wrinkle' cream or any other cream that proves to do some miracle.  But this worked; really it's worth the money!  In fact I have learned that Neutrogena has a line of products that I plan to check out.I am 38 and show very faint lines under my eyes, mostly when I smile-my under eyes seem to wrinkle!  I used the product under my eyes every day morning and night for a week...no change.  Then around the end of the following week I just happened to get ready to apply the serum and realized 'wow, those lines are barely there!'  Now, this doesn't completely ERASE the lines you have but the skin becomes tighter and the 'faint' lines do seem to disappear.  I noticed the skin seemed drier than normal so I make sure I use a moisturizer on top of the serum.  I did not use this product on any other lines on my face, because the only ones I have are under the eyes.  I won't be able to let you know about other areas and how the serum works for those!The bottle or tube this comes in is perfect to use.  Its pump action delivers a generous amount (I usually am careful to only use a half pump so I don't waste the excess).  The serum is silky and absorbs nicely.  There were no side affects or burning or any other issues.  I was careful to only apply under the eyes and not get to close to the under eye lid!I recommend this product because it works!"
4080,"Exceeded expectations - good for any age skin_This eye cream is amazing and (as other reviewers have noted) it's the best I've ever used. One comment asked about women over a certain age - well, I'm not young and I loved it! It feels really good on the skin and I could feel the area around my eyes getting smoother.  Disclosure - I received some as  a review sample and didn't expect to notice a difference from some of the other products I've used. Pleasantly surprised!"
9032,Looks nothing like the picture_This wig does. Not look like the picture. Very poorly made. Much disappointment. Don't waste your money. Quality is bad.
4082,"Wow -- a huge difference in a short time_I've been using the Divine Age Guardian  line -- serum, eye cream, and face cream -- for two weeks now, and I'm stunned at how quickly I noticed a difference.  My skin felt more supple and soft within a few days.  After two weeks, the difference is visually noticeable.  No, my existing lines did not disappear, but the skin itself looks and feels younger.  In only two weeks!  My only concern is that the few spider veins on my cheeks *seem* slightly more visible. (I'll report back if that worsens over time.)  Because I use the entire regimen, I cannot isolate the effects of the serum alone.After cleansing, the serum is the first product in the line that you apply.  Because it's so thin, as serum should be, a little bit goes a long way.  It spreads easily and quickly.  More importantly, it does not leave a 'skin' -- that is, it gets absorbed into the skin instead of becoming an overlay, as some serums do.  That means that when you apply the facial cream on top, you won't be pulling up the serum in the process.  It fully integrates with the Perfective Ceuticals line -- or any moisturizer, for that matter.I'm in my early-fifties, with fair and sensitive skin.  I had no adverse reactions to the serum.  I use this twice a day.  Because my complexion requires daily sunscreen, I apply the serum under my old SPF 15 moisturizer in the morning and under the entire Perfective Ceuticals line at night. If you have oily skin and want to buy only one product in the line, I recommend the serum because it's so light and easily absorbed.  (Note: The manufacturer gave me a sample for review.)-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
5130,"worth my precious $_I was looking for beauty products that work well for me without break my bank account and apparently this is doing the work. I recommend, I have a olive skin complexion and the 25 medium is perfect for me.xo"
927,"I am happy camper_I love this oil. I use it for so many things. I use it on my pimples (I probably get one in a month) and I have seen that the pus dries up soon. I used it on my itchy toes along with avacado oil and it worked great. I poured some in to my head&shoulders shampoo as I was dealing with dandruff that was not a lot but wouldn't go away too. I always used H&S shampoo and it was enough but this winter it wasn't doing anything. After reading online, I figured Tea tree oil is the best medicine for dandruff. It WORKED. My son who has an itchy scalp with minor dandruff also fell in love with it."
4936,"Ardell Fashion Lashes_I'm a beginner to the falsies world, so I played it safe with these. My natural eyelashes are basically non-existent, lol. These lashes make me look very awake and my eyes always look glamorous whether dolled up or plain faced, which I love!"
3185,Fast shipping_I received this product promptly however have not had a chance to use it. I will repost with an update soon.
6536,"worth it!!!_this pallet is amazing, so many colors for such a low price it's insane. every color i can think of. great for makeup artist's"
630,"Been using it for many years and love it_Even though directions call for this to be used once a week between uses of your regular shampoo, I use it every day. I don't use other hair products so I have no residue to wash out. I just like the way this shampoo makes my hair shine and feel. I have a lot of allergies, but there's no allergy trigger in this product."
5200,"A Great Product for Makeup Brushes_I am so glad that I found out about this product. I think it's genius. A great way to store makeup brushes and a wonderful way to dry makeup brushes after cleaning. I have been using these brush guards for about a year now and they do a good job of keeping my makeup brushes in good condition. After I wash my brushes, I just slip the brush guard over them and let them dry. This product is great at keeping the shape of the brushes. They are like new. I don't know how I managed without these brush guards. I think that there are other similar products out there, but I prefer the original brush guard. I also appreciate the reasonable price. I buy more of these as needed. I have all the sizes, the small shadow/liner ones here that I bought again and also the bigger ones for blush and powder brushes. They have never let me down. A reliable product that will keep my precious makeup brushes in great condition and protect them if I travel. Anyone who wants to keep their makeup brushes looking great should consider buying this product. It's a good investment!"
1690,Love this product!!!_Fast Shipment!!! Works great on weaves for taming and detangling hair!!!! I would defininely recommend.to friends and family to use.
2891,"Love it_Good concealer for under eyes, consistency is good, I like the bit of sheen in it, I wouldn't use for dark spots or a large blemish."
9039,"great value beautiful foils!_I loved this set it came quickly and I received the number of pieces listed.  A few of mine were different than the listed but there were no duplicates and the ones I received were beautiful.  I received one or two of the multicolor foils which i love because you can get great color combos on the nails. I received less of the solid color non hollographic foils which is fine by me.  I purchased another set of 24 colors from bm and I like the assortment in these much better. the other brand hand many blah colors: white, cream ... need I say more! If getting specific colors is imperative for you- there are websites where you pick each foil individually... they are 1.00 us a piece but the shipping starts at 6.95!"
764,"LOVE Sun Bunny._Sun Bunny is the best bronzer ever for me. All I wanted was a sun kissed look and sun bunny is exactly that.Most of the bronzers are really dark, some of them have red tones and mostly are very pigmented. I have to always be careful and use it with light hand, and I felt like..well I am wearing a bronzer. After looking in real light (not bathroom) and was applying more foundation to cover the mess.Sun Bunny will work great for fair to light medium skin tones. It gives slight luminous sun kissed look (when applied to right places. I use dark one under my cheekbones and lighter one on my cheeks. At the end I swipe brush in a C letter on both sides of my face (from top of the forehead, under my cheeks and on the jaw line). I use very little product, always start with less and add more if needed.The color has warm yellowish tones which I love. Because I don't use lots of product and blend it well the look is natural, and my real skin, foundation and bronzer are one. The cheeks look like after a day on the sun with a bit of healthy flush. I don't use blush at all, because it also makes me look like I'm wearing make up-sun bunny is my bronzer and blush in one.Product is big and will last for a long time, no touch ups needed, it last all day on the face (I don't have oily skin though).On the side note I also tried Beach Bunny and is a bit darker than here on the picture, so it's better for light medium skintones and up. It was way to dark for me, but the tones and colors are great.Sun Bunny might not show up on darker skintones but it will give luminous glow (not sparkly or glittery look).I have light skintone with yellow undertones and I've tried Nars laguna (nice color but too dark for my liking but my sister with fair skin loves it), Sephora bronzers (to dark), Tarte, Stila, Lorac, Bare Minerals Warmth and more. Most pf them have reddish tones (especially Lorac, which makes me look clownish). Red tones bronzers are good for cooler tones and for rosacea skins warm yellows are better (to mask natural redness)."
1035,"For little boys too!_I just took my baby a bath, he has curly hair with a lot of frizz. After shampooing his hair with johnson's, I applied mixed chicks on his hair while it was wet. I applied a small amount through out his hair while using a wide tooth comb and omg amazing results! Frizz free and his curls are locked in place."
2362,Noticeable difference_Within a few uses there is a noticeable difference to the skin of all members of the family who have been using it. Coincidence or just a change from the norm? don't know but time will tell I guess.
1218,Was just OK_I read so many great reviews about this product so I was extremely disappointed that it smelled so much like baby powder. I won't be buying this again.
8260,Dove Men+Care Sensitive + Face Lotion_Marv loves it. He works outside all day in construction in all kinds of weather year round so it really helps his skin from getting that leathery feel and look. He actually looks a bit younger now that his face is softer... Has a very light scent that is barely noticeable but smells fresh and clean even if you do.
8950,Five Stars_Love them
6640,Superior Quality_This little trio will knock your socks off!! The colors are absolutely stunning!! Super pigmented and feel like crushed velvet going on and last all day!!
7686,"Smooth and effective_With its promise to counteract the effects of make-up, Pond's Luminous Clean Daily Exfoliating Cleanser is probably being marketed to women, but as a guy who has a history of skin trouble (oily skin, acne, etc), I prefer such products to plain soap which I've heard can clog the pores.  I didn't notice any 'microbeads' - this is a smooth liquid rather than a grainy substance - but my skin sure felt good and clean after using it. Recommended."
4201,"Genius Invention_I bought a 4.3 oz of Daisy Perfume by Marc Jacobs (On Amazon) for a great deal. Almost as much as the 2.oz, but as I was getting ready for a 2 week trip I realized I could not take my perfume. I checked out the price for the 2.oz and refused to pay the same (expensive) price just so I could take my perfume. I went to Dillard's to find something and they told me to try a Atomizer. So, I came to Amazon of course to look for one. It eventually to me to this little awesome thing! I didn't know how to use it and nearly broke it trying to figure it out, but I got it and now I LOVE IT!!!!DON'T TAKE ANYTHING OFF OF THE TRAVALO ATOMIZER!1. Just take the bottle out of the package. Do not remove the cap or lid or ANYTHING!2. Get YOUR perfume, remove 'JUST' the cap... (the part that sprays)your perfume bottle will now just be showing the plastic part that sucks out your perfume. DO NOT LOSE YOUR CAP TO YOUR PERFUME.3. Just take the Atomizer and look at the bottom. You will see a little hole. Align that hole with the plastic thing and start pumping your perfume into the atomizer. It is super easy, and the perfume does not leak.I bought two of these little things and have had no problems. (so far) I wish I would have thought of this.I will be buying these for Christmas stocking stuffers."
8864,"Effective, quick to heat up_(review from my daughter)Flat iron works well, and covers a decent amount of hair in a quick time period. The quick heating is critical for those mornings when you're getting ready for school and need to do your hair quickly.Temperature gauge is kind of pointless. Might as well just have Low, Medium, High, etc. who really cares what the temperature is besides being a novelty item."
1237,"Not what I expected_I was happy to find a oil, but I thought it would really moisturize my scalp and hair.  It is oily but it absorbs and drys out the hair, my hair broke off instead of growing out which is what I was hoping for."
7741,Great product!_My hair gets super clumpy when wet and takes a pretty long time to brush through it after I get out of the shower. This product is amazing. I now get out of the shower and towel dry my hair. Spray this product all over my hair and let it sit for about 2 minutes. The brush runs through my hair with such ease and I am pulling less hair out of my head. I will be rebuying this product when I run out.
9117,"Beauty in a bottle_I chose this here product because is one of my favorite, there's nothing that I don't like about this here product.."
9026,"This product is better than the Shea butter I've bought elsewhere_This product is better than the Shea butter I've bought elsewhere. It's GREAT. The others had a grainy texture to it, but this one melts as soon as you begin to rub it in your skin and is great on my hair too. I will be ordering again."
174,"The best for my sensitive skin_I have very sensitive skin and most lotions cause irritation and sometimes a rash.  This lotion does not.  It is wonderfully hydrating, soothing and not greasy.  I am sold on it!  The only other lotion I can use is Vanicream, but Aveeno Skin Relief is my favorite.  I will continue purchasing it from amazon."
533,"Not so magical_I bought this product because my stylist (Ulta Salons) recommended it. Then i decided to come read the online reviews to see how good of a product it was. Nevertheless i have to say that i didnt see any differnce in my hair when using this product if anything i was experiencing more breakage. I have permed african american hair. I am not impressed at all. However, thanks to the other reviwer that broke out the ingrdients, i have started making my own conditoner and hair oil and that had been working GREAT!!!! Regarding the smell i do not mind it at all."
8307,"A #1 deep conditioner_This Suave deep conditioner is the best deep conditioner I've ever used, and that list includes several rather expensive salon types too -- this Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion is a dream come true for hair -- it left my hair in absolutely beautiful condition and I am very pleased to recommend this fine product."
4645,You will look like a PRO_This black rolling makeup case is the perfect gift for any makeup artist. Its sleek and sophisticated and easy to maneuver. The wheels roll smoothly and do not get stuck either.  One major thing I wanted was big compartments and this rolling case has it. You can store everything neatly and organize small and large products. Great for traveling and if you don't want to roll everything you can just pop off the top and use the train case.
3218,CoQ10 firming_I'm not so sure that it is firming but i like the smell and the way it is absorbed and mostly organic.  I will order again.
5593,"I've ordered the lip butter, but I really love the creams._Very nice lip cream, well worth the $5.00 I spent.It's not a over the top pink, its a nice pink and I'm very happy with it!Will continue to buy these products!"
3449,"Really liked this - replaced my old eye serum_I love the Olay Regenerist line but initially thought that the whole 'roller' thing would be a little gimmicky and not worth the extra bucks over the regular eye cream in a tub.After a few nights using this though, I think I'm sold.  I like the eye cream on it's own - it's not as heavy as other eye creams I've used and it has no scent that I noticed.  The application tool turned out to be more useful than I expected.  I didn't waste product (like I sometimes do when I use a tub or tube when I accidentally grab or squeeze out too much) since the rollers allow a little to go a long way.  The lotion isn't being absorbed into your fingers, ever bit of it goes onto that delicate eye area.The metal mini-ball bearing things at the tip of the applicator scared me at first, but after a short while of getting used to holding it gently against my skin, I really enjoyed sitting there for a few minutes massaging my eye area with the cool applicator.The skin around my eyes seems softer and tighter after a few nights of use. (I only used it at night - but you can use it night or day) I use eye cream and moisturizer regularly so I can't really say if any reduction in the fine lines is attributed to my regular regimen or this product, but my makeup went on smoother the next morning around the eyes than I normally experience.I do recommend this - especially if you are familiar with and like the other Olay Regenerist products - I would purchase this again."
8451,"Not just for women; good conditioer for us long haired guys_The only gripe I have is the flowery scent, but as an overall conditioner, I find it quite effective. It's also great at distangling hair, a problem I often have."
8970,"Super soothing_I haven't had a chance to test this on sunburn, yet.  Today is the first day that doesn't really feel like a frozen tundra outside.  However, last night, my husband misplaced his thinking cap and grabbed the cast iron skillet without using the holder.That was loud.And it left a blister on him.We put the sunburn relief gel on it and wrapped it overnight.  This morning, the blister is gone.  The burned area isn't even pink.  My husband says it still feels a little bit tender, but it's a lot better than he expected it to me.  This is really good stuff.  When I run out, I will buy more for sure."
5465,"Wonderful for my Grandma_My grandmother has medium-length, wispy, coarse hair. I was worried that her current rollers were pulling hair out. I bought these, not realizing how big they were or WHY they were called satin rollers. I purchased on a whim and am now a satisfied consumer. Not only are they a perfect match for her hair type, but I've noticed she doesn't have the usual frizz and fly-aways like she did with her other rollers. Her hairstyle stays in place! I will be buying more for her to replace her entire roller set. I hope I can find some that are a little bit smaller for the back of her hair."
1429,SUPER STUFF!_I don't like the powder blushes which leave too much product and hard to blend. This is so easy to blend and looks so natural. Blending ability like no other.Well worth the money; wish they had it it the US - hard to find here.
3167,best makeup for price._I use L'Oreal primer under this and I can tell you it performs BETTER than L'Oreal makeup and The Body shop . for a better price. . I get the best results from primer . and I use 2 shades the darker for the sides and the lighter for the T- zone - BLEND well ... sponge and then dust .. I also use the Dream Matte powder --- with a light touch do not cake just dust .. and you will have a flawless finish too!
4620,"Natural shampoo_I can see that this product contains as limited chemicals as possible. It leaves a little rough feel to the hair after use, which might not be a good thing to many people, but that reminds me of using soap nuts which gives lather to hair, but still feels not so moisturised. It is a natural product and I love it for that. I don't mind using a conditioner later to get a good feel. A very nice product if you are trying to keep away from sulphates and other chemicals."
316,"Joey from Baltimore_This is so refreshing, but toning after I shave!  It is thorough enough to tone, but offers moisture to the beard . and helps to moisturize the face, so my serums go on smoother!"
8323,"Good inexpensive shampoo for family use_For reference, I have baby fine, long, naturally wavy hair with highlights and lowlights. My hair tends to get frizzy and dry-looking on the ends and I usually have to use a frizz-reducing shampooSuave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing Shampoo, 12.6 Ounce (Pack of 2)which is my favorite shampoo and conditioner.This shampoo works okay for my hair, though, I wouldn't use it all the time as, I need more of a smoothing shampoo. This is more for normal hair or someone who doesn't need a special product for smoothing or body. Though, for not being a special smoothing shampoo this does leave my hair fairly managable.This shampoo and the matching conditionerSuave Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Conditioner, 22.5 Ounceis a great choice for those on a budget or for large families as this is a large bottle which would last a very long time.Also, I love the scent of this matching conditioner and shampoo. They have just a nice, clean scent that isn't overwhelming. I even use this shampoo as a shower gel or to shave my legs- I like the scent that much!Overall, I would repurchase this if my favorite wasn't available, it's a great all-around product at an inexpensive price."
9819,Two Stars_I like OPI nail polish but this tint is very thick and hard to apply. Won't be repurchasing!
6289,Excellent product_I bought these on a whim after being pleasantly surprised by other RoC products.  They really have a nice skin care line.  These work well and are relatively inexpensive compared to similar products.  My only complaint is they should offer refill packs of 60 or 100 so the packaging isn't wasted.  I like the way the jar opens with a flip top lid to avoid fumbling around with wet hands.  The product gives you a nice clean face without making your face feel tight.  I will continue to purchase.
8002,Nice but a bit stiff for my tastes_Lovely sponges and a good value but just a bit stiff for me. I prefer more airy blenders but these stay in my arsenal.
4726,Pretty good_I am a product junkie .... From department stores to drugstores to shopping networks.... It is a good price points seems to deliver the same results as some pricer brands. I miss the free samples!!!! But the product goes on nice and it did not irratate my skin.
3628,"You've got to try this!_I have to admit I was skeptical with the reviews, first of all because I'm not a big Avon fan and second I've tried a lot of eye creams.  THIS IS THE BEST ONE HANDS DOWN!!!!  Thank you Avon!!!!  From now on I will be getting this eye cream."
5446,"not for me_i have short hair, usually use rough paste by redken. this seems more like a pomade than texturizing. left my hair looking greasy"
1103,"Love it_love this scent, bought a small bottle and then ended up getting the big bottle for my birthday, smells very clean."
3060,"Bad Colors and too small_I know it says small in the title, but these are almost too small for use in  my opinion. Instead, I suggest going to the grocery and picking up 98 cent ones that are bigger, and you can select the color. I say this because the colors that came in mine included 2 green poufs that looked like barf green: not appealing for gifts. So skip this purchase and head to the grocery store instead."
3175,it's ok_Took a few tries to get any color change. But I still like it. Would recommend it to a friend and will continue to use it.
4133,"Smells great_Many times I go to put this on and I cannot find it, Why????? Because my 19 year old son has it in his room. I keep telling hem to buy his own."
3785,"Love the roller_This is my first time trying out cream foundation. I was using liquid true match before but it was lacking convenience of usage when you are on the go. I gave a try to this roller and loved it. Now I even use this applicator for my liquid foundation to have more even look, and of course it is a must have when I'm out and about."
102,This is one of the best I have ever used._It goes on really smoothly. It keeps my face well hydrated. I have mature skin so this is really important to me. It's really a great product!!!
9280,"Nice variety_I love the variety within this set, even if there are a few images I probably won't use for myself. Although I haven't tried all of the plates (yet), the ones I have used have come out great (and I use cheap nail polish)."
7094,"Very different from other peels in this product line ... Feels minty fresh on my skin & age spots have lightened a little_I purchased this product with the sole intent of lightening melasma patches on my cheeks. After 2 uses, I noticed that the spots have lightened a little. Other reviewers have mentioned that this product burned their skin: everyone's skin is different, and that is why it is important to do a small test patch before applying to your whole face!The Lactic Acid peel has a VERY tingly, minty feel to it--so much so that my eyes started to water shortly after applying the peel. The product is viscous enough (about as thick as Elmer's school glue) that I didn't have to worry about the stuff running into my eyes or nose, so I knew the watery eye-thing had to do with the herbal additions. After a few minutes I rinsed thoroughly and applied moisturizer: no burning or excessive tightness (in contrast to the Glycolic Peel, which continues to sting for about an hour after rinsing). I didn't notice lightening of the age spots until I performed another Lactic Acid Peel at the end of the week. PLEASE BE REALISTIC IN YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF ANY PEEL--this isn't laser treatment! No miracles, just slow and steady improvement over time.I have used the Salicylic Peels (in two different concentrations) and Glycolic Peels in this product line for over a year and have noticed that my skin responds very differently to each of the peels. I wait at least 10 days between using different types of acid. All of their acids improve my skin texture--tighter pores, firmer appearance, and fewer lines--but I noticed that the salicylic helps with breakouts the most, while the glycolic peel seems to help with the age spots and deep lines around my mouth and between my eyebrows. I have the least experience with the lactic acid peel, but I did notice that it seemed to lighten my age spots even more than the glycolic acid mix. The spots are still there, but they are more easily covered by foundation/powder, and the color has shifted from dark brown-charcoal to a light brown freckle-ish tone in just a couple of treatments.I highly recommend all of the peels in the Perfect Image line. I have tried a few peels from other manufacturers with less success and more than a little trepidation regarding their quality control/safety."
2759,"Helps drastically with my 2 year old's eczema_My son had steroids prescribed to him for his eczema however I do not prefer to use it on him, he is 2 yrs old and I was looking for more of a less abrasive route. I swear by this and Aveeno Babies for eczema, I actually prefer Aveeno but they both are good. I use Cetaphil in the summer and Aveeno in the winter."
9383,"The Ultimate Tickling Device!_Ok, so the folks at BelleSha probably didn't invent this as a tickling device but that is just what it is for me!  I had no idea my size 15D's were so darn sensitive!  The scrubber has two textured sides and a removable pumice stone in the center.  We have small tiles on the floor of our shower and it was pretty much impossible to get the suction cups to hold.  On a smooth surface you will probably have a much better experience.  I was still able to use the device by stepping on one side while rubbing my other foot on the other side and was pleased with the end results, even if I was forced to endure some self-induced tickling.Other reviews mention the stone in the middle was glued in, not so in the model I received.  On mine the stone was attached to a plastic piece with four tabs that slide into the foot scrubber and I found it stayed in just fine.  With that said, I found it much easier to remove the stone and use it by hand so it may just come down to personal preference.I also saw other reviews mentioned the dreaded PVC smell and mine did not suffer from that at all.  I went to go try and give it a 1-10 rating by smelling the device and after a few uses all it smells like is the citrus body wash I use.  I am VERY sensitive to the PVC smell and have returned other items from shower curtains to chair mats because of the odor but had absolutely no issue with this product.The bottom line for me is that this foot scrubber does what it is supposed to do and will give you a little foot massage (or tickling experience) when you use it.  4-Stars from me because as the Amazon ratings go I do like it, it's not something I'll use every day but I can see using it a couple times weekly.I was provided with a sample of this item for the purposes of doing a fair and honest review."
4238,"Great_I love this brush! It leaves my hair feeling very soft. It doesn't rip my hair, either. I would highly recommend it!"
4247,"Sally Hansen Complete Salon Manicure nail polish in Plum's the Word_I am a big OPI or Essie fan as far as nail polishes go, but I had read a review about how good this particular Sally Hansen product was so I gave it a try. It is a lovely dark plum color, it went on easily, and lasted as long as the OPI and Essie polishes do. I probably will by more from this particular kind--Complete Salon Manicure. As you probably know, Sally Hansen makes several types of nail polishes, and I can't speak to how good or whatever those are, but the Complete Salon Manicure line lives up to the positive review I read."
3964,"TERRIBLE! WRECKED MY NAILS!_I love the THEORY of this product, because my nails always get that tiny tear in the corner, and in the past, they've peeled a lot. However, they haven't peeled in quite a while, until I put this product on. Which, ironically, I bought to PREVENT my nails from peeling. The very next day after I put it on, I noticed that my polish (over top, I used this as a base coat) had chipped off and shortly afterwards, I noticed the top layer of the nail itself was starting to peel. When I took my top coat off to put on a new layer of the REBUILD, AS THEY INSTRUCT, I saw another of my nails had begun peeling beneath the polish. Yes, this tends to be a problem for me historically, but my nails haven't peeled in 8 months, so... I'd rather use the $1 basecoat from the drug store and have great nails, than this. Won't buy it again, will actually probably throw it out. Don't waste your money."
9345,"Christina Moss Conditioner_As I said with the Shampoo, I am quite picky as my hair can be difficult at times (combo oily/dry) I like this conditioner as it works, doesn't feel heavy and leaves my hair manageable"
8020,"Pretty good with one flaw_This mascara is in an easy to see, green container. The product does not clump as stated from my several days of wearing this. It goes on really well, not too thick or thin. The brush does a good job of getting my lashes evenly coated. The one flaw is that after a few hours of wear, if I accidentally touch my lashes, the black mascara starts to flake off my lashes. I'm not talking about rubbing my eyes or anything fierce, but just touching my lashes -- black flakes. It's not horrendous, mind you, but still annoying as I expect my mascara to stay on even if I touch my eyes a little bit.  But still, I do like that it doesn't clump, looks greats on my eyes, and is in a cute little green container (as opposed to a black one which is hard to find in my makeup bag)."
1074,"MURAD IS WONDERFUL!_I LOVE THE WHOLE MURAD LINE. THIS CLEANSER IS GREAT! CLEANS DEEP AND SMELLS GREAT. IT CAN BE A BIT DRYING, BUT I MOISTURIZE AFTER PRETTY WELL. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I SWITCH BETWEEN THIS AND ANOTHER MURAD CLEANSER FOR ULTIMATE BEAUTY CLEANSING."
2628,I love it!_This is exactly what I was looking for. It is nice and soft in comparison to the loofah I had in the past. It does the job in terms of exfoliating.
1551,Not impressed_These inserts were pretty hard in my arches and they squeak! I can't stand walking in them for the noise they make! I even added powder to my shoes and still squeaky.
4415,"LOVE_Smooth and silky! I was skeptical about buying a Paul Mitchell product on amazon, but I love it and I don't regret my decision."
9243,"Protection may be fine, but it smells like hairspray going on_You may be familiar with the Hawaiian Tropic brand product which comes in an almost identical can (although the background colour is brown) and smells like the islands. This is not that product.What's good?It sprays on evenly and consistently. You twist the top away from the lock position, push, and spray. I didn't have any issues with coverage of the product or the quality of the spray. It came out very evenly and was easy to spray on my arms and even on my face. It does not feel sticky when going on, nor does it feel &#34;wet&#34; or inappropriately oily.What's bad?The smell. All I could smell was aerosol - a very strong scent of hairspray. I will point out that the smell does not linger throughout the day, but it immediately caused me to start coughing and my nose to burn/tingle. The product smells AWFUL when sprayed, and for me that's a showstopper.I directly compared this product to Hawaiian Tropic in the above areas of coverage, even spray, wetness, and scent. Banana Boat failed in the area of scent. Because I need to be able to use a product without having a negative reaction to it, this product lost significant points, which is a shame because otherwise the form-factor of the product is easy to use."
262,"OPI is still the best!_Gorgeous deep navy color, beautifully saturated, easy to apply and lasts the longest for me without chipping.  I'm an OPI junkie."
505,"Great moisturizer!_I have been looking for a tinted moisturizer that actually does what it's supposed to. I use the Almond---my complexion is close to Halle Berry's, a honey brown I guess.  As long as I don't use too much (which you shouldn't do anyway) it does a great job. It's very light and doesn't make me feel like I have any makeup on.  I'm a big fan of the natural look and no one can tell that I have this on. Most people just comment that my skin looks nice. I workout alot and this stuff doesn't run or streak, which is nice when I need to wipe all the sweat off my face. Since I hate foundation this is perfect for me. I bought the Laura Mercier sponges also--pricey but well worth it. They work beautifully together. Would definitely recommend!"
6941,"Where have you been all my life_I should have bought something like this years ago, but it never came across a product like this. I have been losing a lot of hair detangling, this brush has been a miracle cure. I lose so much less hair. Even less that when finger detangling. I find the handle a bit awkward to hold and tend to lose my grip. This product could be improved with a rubber no-slip backing."
6201,"Hair MIRACLE at work here!!_My daughter and I LOVE this product.  I cut corners on hair products and cosmetics as much as I can, mostly buying drug store brand products.  While you can get this at the drug store, the price is pretty steep.  It is WORTH it.  It smells great and about ten spritzes will do for medium length hair so it lasts a while.  It INSTANTLY detangles hair without combing.  Once dry, your hair is just perfectly soft and ready to style.  There is no evidence of product in your hair.  It never makes hair greasy or weighty.  This product actually makes it possible for me to go longer between washes unlike many products which cause you to have to wash."
2560,Works like they use in the Salon!_You know how sometimes when you get highlights or your hair dyed a light blonde and it ends up with the reddish tinge.......yeah that. This most definitely tones it down. Plain and simple.
7577,"Subtle color_The color on this stain is subtle, at least for me. It is wonderful to pull a whole look together though. I can't say how long the stain lasts, but it's better than nude lips!"
9434,"Great potential.._I color my hair allot mostly something in the red family, well red fades fast and of course it not healthy to color every-time I fell like so I was happy to try this color enhancer/extension from John Frieda. I have only tried the one bottle but I notice enhanced shine, and a slower fading of my salon color. So if you want hold on to that color or stay close to it give this a try...it is not a hair dye it merely works with what you have already."
6258,"Some are great!_So I ordered this a while back and I really like the bright or deep colors because you don't need more than two coats for those colors. As for the light colors you need a lot of coats and it takes a while to dry. The glitter polishes I hardly use because they are really thick and take way to much time to dry, but I only got a few of those so it's fine!"
9923,transforming_I love the argon oil I was using until now. This emu oil has transformed my dry frizzy mop to a beautiful shiny and smooth wavy do. I also started using it to clear the dry skin around my nose and in just a few days it is gone!
1680,Don't waste your money_This lotion sits on the skin and goes on like a 99 cent bottle of lotion.  There is no fragrance and I was duped  by a famous dermatologist on tv.  Never again.
8935,they look pretty natural_they look really great. they did chip a few times but im pretty rough with my hands. i would deff buy again.
4496,"Love NYX!_I love Nyx!  They have to be my favorite cosmetics brand.  The price is right and the color looks exactly how it does in the picture.  The light pink look great on for a softer look.  The lipstick is smooth and in my opinion, Nyx lipstick has the such a strong pigment and a very dramatic look on the lips."
2818,"Little to no scent and dried out hair..._My husband used this shampoo and was impressed with it at all.  Although he felt it cleaned his hair alright, he felt more strongly that it made his hair very dry ('like a haystack' is how he put it).  Although I thought it smelled good out of the bottle, I could not smell it on his hair, even immediately after he used it.  For a product like this I definitely thought the scent would (and shoul) stick around longer than opening the bottle.We would not buy this again."
6169,great product_does good for the scalp and does not leave any residue and is good to give balance and shine for any hairdoo.
6286,Surprised!_This is my first purchase of this particular product and I LOVE it! The claims are true!!  I recommend this item.
8875,"Great Styling Tool!_Wonderful flat iron, I love the digital temperature control it is great for not over heating when styling my hair.  This is a great tool at an amazing price.  My hair looked and felt soft and smooth to the touch.  This will be great to travel with, my hair is natural and it is a quick and easy process achieving the look that I want."
4073,GREAT PRODUCT_Love it!!  This is the BEST facial scrub.  I looked around for a scrub and this was the best deal and I could not be more pleased.
7306,"Works well for me, with or without conditioner_I have tried several items in this line, including the men's shampoo.  This shampoo has a pleasant scent and did a good job of getting rid of the flakes my dry scalp produces.  Unlike the men's shampoo, I did notice that my hair seemed a little drier after using just the shampoo, as opposed to using the shampoo and conditioner.  On days that I plan to stay at home and air dry my hair, I just used the shampoo.  On days that I needed to dry and style my hair, I used the shampoo and the matching conditioner with very good results.  I have not experienced any allergic reactions to this product, and I have sensitive skin.  I believe it would be a good choice for most people.  If your hair is on the oily side, the shampoo alone would work well, but if you have normal to dry hair, or use a lot of 'heat' appliances, then you may want to add the conditoner to the mix."
2158,"Using to thicken hair_I'm using this in combination with coconut oil to put on my scalp to promote healthy hair growth and supposedly it helps with thickness so we'll see about that in a few months from now. It's pretty thick so you're gonna need to mix it with another oil if you apply it to your scalp, at least that's what I had to do."
6465,never again_all there product just waste money i tried them all hope would be sensitive all did break my skin out and burn it to.
4922,"Wonderful product_I have long, thick dry hair.  I color my hair once a month, and the ends were starting to show some major wear.  I put this on everyday after I wash my hair and dry it with a towel.  It works like magic!  It smooths my hair and it is really making my hair look healthier.  This is a product I cannot live without."
6409,Excellent brushes_Have used many make up brushes throughout the years - these are the best I've ever found. Have purchased several and highly recommend. A little more expensive than some but you get what you pay for. I use for both powder and liquid foundations and they are excellent for both.
302,"Awesome product! Almost perfect_This is a great product. It completely covered my grays and the color lasted for a very long time. In fact, I think its coverage and color longevity is better than some of the more conventional brands of hair dye (Revlon, Clairol, etc). The sulfate free shampoo that it comes with is probably the best sulfate free shampoo I've ever used. I'm considering buying a larger sized bottle to use in stead of the one I use now. (Sorry, Renpure.)Only two minor drawbacks. Because the color lasts for so long, my roots grew out A LOT before the color faded. I wish the kit came with some way to mix up a smaller amount when you just want to do a small touch up. I'm not enough of a DIY haircoloring expert to measure out the correct amounts myself. Also, the conditioner is a little bit runny and doesn't seem to soak into may hair. I added a few drops of sweet almond oil to my hair while it was still damp as an added moisturizer/conditioner."
5791,Good Stuff_This is a good moisturizing lotion.  I'm very pleased with it.  I'm not fond of the smell (doesn't stink just not my favorite).  To me it kinda smells like a cross between vanilla and eucalyptus but I think everyone smells things differently.  Regardless it is a good moisturizer its not greasy goes on smooth  and silky.
1892,"dry, old and clumpy_I don't know if this product was old but when it arrived it was dry, clumpy and gross. Terrible. Do not purchase."
3491,"So far, so good!_I've been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I'm enjoying it so far! It definitely cuts down on shine and is in a nice sleek case that could easily slip into any purse pocket. The sponge on the inside in handy too, but I've been using a brush to apply the makeup. I'm curious to see how it'll do during the summer months when I have to worry about shine!"
7625,Smooth & Shiny Black_This black goes on smooth and shiny. It only takes two coats to reach its deep black. To me its a must have for any polish collection. I don't think you can go wrong with Liquid Leather.
6324,"ORANGE BECAUSE OF SEA BUCKTHORN_Wish it came in a bigger bottle...It has an orange color to it, which scared me because orange is a huge red flag (orange flag?) for vitamin C serums. However, this contains orange oil and sea buckthorne, both of which have that vivid orange color.  Also, this doesn't appear to contain L-ascorbic acid, which is the C vitamin that is great for your skin but that makes some C serums so unstable that they turn orange.  This is a great product and I have had great results.I believe the tiny little bottle is so that you don't buy the industrial size and keep it around until it makes you grow gills. The smell is amazing if you like oranges."
8936,"Great!_I actually purchased this from a local Family Dollar while I was trying different things for my hair. Before, I was using the Argan Oil Curl Cream which does not compare to this. This doesn't make my hair crunchy, my curls are tight & soft, & it lasts. Smells amazing & no frizz! Definitely buying more."
3344,"Works great, but still need conditioner_My kids have used this shampoo for years and I have been very pleased with it.Pros:Smells greatReasonable priceTear freeDoes a good job getting the hair cleanCons:For both kids, I still have to use conditioner in addition to this product.  It just doesn't condition enough."
2873,cute color_got it with the stamping kit which doesn't work so i just use the polish cute cute color but had to 4 star cause not usable for intended purpose
6430,One Star_the lid does not fit not cool
5714,Love this one too!_I received this Cnd Shellac UV Color Coat Tutti Frutti nail polish in a very prompt and timely manner from this seller.  The color was as I expected for a nice bright hot pink.  I haven't used it yet but am not disappointed at all.  Thank you again for another great polish I'm sure I'll get a lot of use out of!
6174,"Works but..._Worked well, kinda stiff almost like a nerf ball, but looks nothing like the picture. Didn't really expand either.  It's ok"
1915,Good Stuff_I think the gel is a great product. It's gentle and I just love that it has tea tree oil as one of the ingredients. It's not a miracle gel but it does work.
497,"Anti-Static doesn't exist_I've read the pros and cons on this site.  The pros outweighed the cons for me.  For me the size was just right.  However, this brush generated lots of static in my hair.  Before and after I went to the salon.  So, I thought it was just me.  I gave the brush to my friend, and she experienced the same problem.  STATIC.Great massaging brush though, but can't get past the static."
4686,Works great_This product has been a good one. I was satisfied with my purchase. I would recommend this product for the price it would be worth your investment.
9326,"worth every penny_Wow, if you're reaching the end of the rope trying to find a conditioner that will leave your hair soft, shiny and protected after coloring, please try this.  Yes, I know it's a little expensive but if you're paying to get color, then this shouldn't be a problem to keep the color.  I get my hair highlighted and it seemed after a week or two, the beautiful blond highlights that were so shiny and bright, were dulling and dry.  I'm not sure what ingredient in it is doing the job, I&#34;m assuming the grape seed but whatever it is, yes please !I have very thick hair and long hair so the tangles are a problem for me too.  This somehow makes the comb go through it easier when wet and after it dries, well, it does make a huge difference.  In my opinion, it is worth it and does work.  Try it, if you're not satisfied, then don't buy it again.  I really think if you have issues with your color fading and your hair dry, thsi will work.  I do workout every day and I swim in a pool so my hair really goes through the ringer.  I tug it, pull it, color it and soak it in chlorine (in the pool) and after I use this product, it seems to really repair and protect it.  Try it, you will most likely love it too."
2754,"Works well and the price is right_I purchased this in conjunction with theBaByliss Pro - Porcelain Plate Ceramic Flat Iron - 1 Inch - model: BABP9557which heats up to 450 degrees.  I sprayed this product on my long hair before blow drying and a light dose before using the flat iron.The results I achieved using this spray were very good.  Not as good asStraight Sexy Hair smooth & Protect Flat Iron Hairspray by Sexy Hair for Unisex - 4.1 Ounce Hair Spray, but the price per container is about half that of Sexy Hair if purchased separately, and about 2/3rds less when purchased in this 6 pack.My hair is left feeling smooth, soft and having no sticky residue, which I can't say for most of the other products I've tried over the past 5 years of flat ironing my thick, curly hair.I do wish it was more of a fine spray (less wet) and that it didn't take so much to get the kind of results I want, but some with fine hair may need less and only to do it with blow drying.  You'll have to play with it to figure out what works best for your hair.If you're looking for heat protection that also gives you a sleek, no flyaway look for less, give TRESemme European Instant Heat Tamer Styling Spray a try."
4246,Makes skin look great_Makes my pores much less noticable and gives my skin that photofinish look . I also use the tinted mineral veil.
8463,"The Next Advertising Generation's Hai Karate_Hai Karate was a cheap cologne marketed 40 years ago with campy commercials.  Every bottle came complete with self-defense instructions - to fight off the women who'd attack you after detecting it's scent.  I have no idea whether they sold much cologne - Wikipedia says they faded out back in the '80s - but when I saw the first Axe commercials I had a pleasant glimmer of recognition: it was a knockoff of HK's old campaign.Axe was introduced with commercials in which women, upon getting a good sniff of an axe-scented man, threw themselves at the poor (lucky?) guy like a ravenous lioness on a ribeye.So - here's the REAL question: is the Axe 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner worth your hard-earned cash?  The odor is actually faint compared to blockbuster scents like Irish Spring or Coast - but it's pleasant enough.  It works well enough on my hair.  At the same price as a competitor - I'd get it again.  At a higher price - different story.I can confirm that the Mrs. wasn't driven with an unquenchable urge to tear into me based on the use of this product alone.Dang it."
2443,"Does not work, made my condition even worse!_Didn't order it from Amazon, ordered it from the company via the celebrity studded tv ad & it made my moderate acne severe & my slightly oily skin very oily! I used for 3 months & it didn't do anything except exacerbate the problems! I am going to stick with Clean & Clear or Neutrogena products. (Note to self, just because a pretty celebrity endorses a product [as they are paid to do so], doesn't mean the product is worth a ****!)"
8168,"Very cute!_This is well made and very cute. The clip itself is sort of tight if you have thicker hair. It works wells for me as my hair is thin. It is more pretty in person than it shows on the Internet. I would recommend for children, women with short or thin long hair as mine is. You might be able to adjust the clip too or because the item is handmade, it might very as far as how it is attached. Very beautiful hair piece though! Quicker than expected delivery as well."
9082,"Softens Course Hair_I have short naturally curly 'course' hair so any product that promises 'soft and shiny' has my attention. I pumped 2-3 drops into the palms of my hands, rubbed together, and then ran my hands through my hair, styling as usual. At times, I thought the product softened my hair too much. I don't know how well this product will hold up in the humidity, but for a dry day it was great!I am editing this review after several weeks: this product is great! My hair has never felt so soft and styled so easily."
2897,good brushes_considering the price for 12 brushes they are good but not perfect ..the face and the contouring brush shed after i washed thembut the others are fine and i use them alotI'm glad With this purchase
6315,"Missha Perfect Cover BB Cream is great!_You could wear this under foundation, but to be honest it's a foundation in itself.  This color is a nice golden tone and I use it as a foundation and then put a light mineral powder over the top.  I use it over moisturized skin.  I have dry skin and this is not drying nor is it oily.  I think it would suit any skin type really, apart from someone with very oily skin.  I'm very happy with this product."
535,Great Fragrance-free product_Free & Clear makes a variety of products from shampoo to liquid soap. Great products for sensitive skin. No fragrance or harsh chemicals. I high recommend.
591,"Biolage_Have been using this shampoo for over 25 years. It works, my hair is great and looks and feels just as soft and shiney as it was when I was in my twenties. Simply the best shampoo I have ever found and unless they take it away, I will never use another."
9220,Makes a French Manicure EASY!!!_This is the PERFECT white for a French Manicure.  It applies so easy and you just have to use one thin coat - it's very opaque so the tip turns out perfect - not thick and uneven.
7493,"Clear scalp hair therapy..._I like this product it really tames,smoothes and banishes frizz for my hair type which is somewhat coarse and thick as well as dry. Like other products in this line I do think this maybe better for ethnic type hair, or just really stubborn hair. The smell is a bit strong but not overwhelming and a little goes along way. The ingredients could be better but all in all it's a OK product.."
7650,great and fast delivery_Great product. Got 2 weeks before expected delivery date. But missing a couple bows no more than 3 missing. I would use them again.
5709,Great Fall/Winter Color~_This was the 1st Gel-Polish I bought. This is a fabulous fall/winter color! Its the perfect shade of a dark red. Its exactly the color that is shown in the display picture too - which is always hard to know how true it is. Love it and would highly recommend~
6541,"GOOD Deal!_This is a very nice palette, it comes with every color possible that you could think of, the pigmentation of these eyeshadows are very very good. I'm happy with everything and the packaging/ palette is very nice."
441,"MUST-HAVE FOR AMBER LOVERS!_OK, so admittedly, I am an amber maniac! Always have been. I have tried almost every amber perfume out there, oils and solids, but I prefer the earthy, more natural-smelling ones. I bought this amber butter on a whim, and all I can say is that I was absolutely blown away! It is this type of scent that originally got me hooked on amber!  The first amber oil I ever purchased smelled exactly like this butter, but I could never find the oil again, as the supplier went out of business. I have been searching for over 10 years! I have finally found a worthy replacement!  Thank you!OH, and the little wooden jar is sooooo cute! It has a screw-on lid, so I think it will be ok in my purse. Be aware that it is small, but a little goes a long way with this!!!"
9839,"Rosehip Seed Oil, A 'How To'_I received a sample of this product to test and review.As someone that has used rosehip seed in the past, it's a pleasure to pass along some uses and why I feel this is a good brand.First, it's organic. Second, the packaging.Dark glass is the ONLY way to store this oil, and I have seen brands in clear glass as well as the dreaded plastic. Dark glass is imperative as this is an oil that can lose it's beneficial properties if not stored correctly, and can also go rancid quickly. Any unadulterated oil can go rancid, but rosehip seed is particularly vulnerable. It's best to put the bottle in the fridge, decanting only what you need for a few weeks at a time, or mixing with other ingredients that can prolong shelf life.Because of the above, I use rosehip seed as a carrier oil, that is as a base that gets added on to. If you are reading this you probably searched for rosehip seed oil because you do the same. The essential fatty acids in rosehip seed make it one of my favorite carrier oils for hair growth.I'd like to share my recipe for an overnight hair treatment.Start with a few tablespoons of avocado oil or mashed fresh avocado, add a tablespoon each of jojoba oil and rosehip seed oil. Mix in 5-10 drops each of rosemary, lavender, and carrot essential oil. Carrot is pretty expensive, but amazing stuff. If you need to skip it, open a vitamin E gel cap and squeeze it in. Even better, add a bit of MSM.Slather on clean, dry hair, cover with cap (I use a disposable shower cap and over that a thick stretch headband) and leave on for 5 hours or overnight. Rinse and air or blow dry.Some people use rosehip seed oil as a facial skincare product. Amp up your regular night cream by adding up to 50% of this to it, especially if you are over 40 and/or a sun worshiper.A must for anyone that likes natural DIY skincare. When you DIY, you avoid all the chemicals that are used as preservatives in your products."
1778,"Not for me._I do not care for this product. Maybe I have high expectations with my purchases online...but this stuff just doesn't work for me. It's hard to transfer from the brush to your lashes, so what I had to do was pinch the brush and pull up and use my fingers to apply...even then I haven't seen ANY progress to my brows or lashes."
768,"Soothing for my very dry skin_I don't know why I ever stopped using Dove Body wash a couple years ago but I'm happy now that I am using it again and this formula in particular works very well for me.  My skin is not only very dry but I also have psoriasis where patches of skin are highly sensitive.  This body wash definitely is soothing and moisturizing.  Most important is simply that it cleans well without irritating.  If you have normal to dry skin or even extra dry skin, eczema, etc. I would highly recommend!"
8859,"Love it as much as I knew I would_I have to admit before getting this Blemish Remover I would love it & use it, the reason being I have had a similar tool since I was a teen in the 80s & there is nothing better for when you get a blackhead in your ear, yes you know how painful those can be, well for us these tools are a lifesaver for sure.We all know squeezing or popping pimples & blackheads can cause skin issues, but sometimes one they have started draining, swelled up & causing pain or as I said get into our ears we need a tool to completely clean out the area so they problem does not return & to ease pain soon. That is where one of these tools can be so handy & a miracle worker. I actually watched a DRs episode I think it was several years ago where they were discussing pimples & blackheads in the ears & on the nose & the pain they cause & the need for a tool like this.  Even if you only need this tool once or twice a year you will be singing it praises.This one is great quality stainless steel, not some flimsy tool, it has 2 different size ends for you to gently slide over mature blemishes to expel them properly & cleanly. My teen have loved using this tool after I taught them to use it not only properly but at the proper time then to wash face afterwards with baking soda water. This tool does work far better after a shower or hot bath, pat area dry & use it."
7066,"does not curl_while this does get hot, it does poor job actually curling the hair. I bought a larger barrel, hoping for looser curls, but there's a difference between *no curl* and *looser curl*. So far, this iron has done nothing for me. if i grab a smaller section, the hair slips from under the grip. if I grab a larger section, the outer curls don't get set at all. very disappointing."
7028,"LOVE THE SOAP_It smells good like oranges, it does dry out the skin but dugh it is a bleaching soap. Use lotion after shower people. Good product it also helped dry out my oily skin in which was needed for me. Recomended highly for good price but need a bigger bar it does go quickly.  but I use every shower daily"
2376,"Compact and Effective_I've used just about every acne product ever made.  This one actually seems to do something, and its simple.  Slap a pad onto the velcro top, wet, and turn it on.  I noticed immediatley improved skin texture.  In fact, I had identified a few troubled areas before I began just to see if it could handle them and when I was finished, they were totally clean and clear!  And days later, no breakouts!  That's the true sign of success!"
238,"Oh My Gawd..._This perfume is absolutely divine!  I have been trying for years to find a light, sweet, floral perfume that didn't smell like sickening sweet cotton candy or bubble-gum.  I've found it.  I did a google search a few weeks ago entering in 'best selling perfume for women' and the website Auric Blends came up with Egyptian Goddess listed on the site.  I took a chance.  I had no idea what the perfume would smell like ... I just knew that I needed to try something new and I knew that I did not want to pay $24 for a 1.07 ounce bottle just in case I hated it.  I decided to try the $7 roll on fragrance.  Oh, I'm so sorry that I didn't buy the larger bottle now!This oil based perfume is a sweet, soft musk smell with floral undertones... the minute I rolled this water of the nile on my wrists, my mood lifted tremendously.  I'm a big aromatherapy fan -- love incense and aromatic oils and fragrant soaps... all that great stuff.  This being an oil based perfume will ensure that the fragrance lasts.  Oh, I love this stuff so much.  Now I have two favorite perfumes:  Lalique (French) and Egyptian Goddess... I'm in heaven! ;)"
9015,"I love the designs!_While they aren't konad(the best!), they work pretty well and I still get lots of compliments.  For the price you really can't beat them"
1257,No difference for me!_I just didn't see the results other reviewers saw---in fact I saw no change at all. It's just that simple.
4357,"OMG the Greatest_All I have to say is OMG, i have been searching for a conditioner for over 6 months that works with my natural 3c neck length hair and I have to say I found it, this is the best I have experienced so far, the slip is wow, my fingers just passes through my hair with such ease, I will totally recommend it.  CG talks about staying away from cones etc, but I got to say this condition has Dimethicone, I am not sure if the other ingredients nils it out but of all the cone free conditions I tried Hello hydration has been much better - People its worth a try"
2035,"Not impressed_I bought this product, not sure what to expect.  I quickly found that it caused irretation and sat on top of the skin.  I had to stop using it, and didn't mind because I didn't like that it felt oily on my skin.  As an alternative, I opted for the olay eye roller.  Maybe I am an isolated case and this doesn't bother other people, but for me, this product was no good (but it did smell nice)."
1616,I havent even gotten them yet/falls off_I had high hopes for this product but it is now three days to a week late! I have contacted the seller three times and have not heard a word i do not recommend this product from this seller. As for the product i opened the ones my friend got off a different site and tryed to use them. They fall off constantly but do indeed look natural if you can find a better way to stick them in.
5173,Doesn't Work_I not just if this is only for Bare escentuals but I tried this with my powered and liquid foundation and both time it failed.
9813,"Great for hair and skin!!_I love using Argan oil on my skin and hair! It leaves it feeling and looking so much more refreshed and overall healthier. Having natural curly hair the Argan oil helps to tame and smooth it while also making it easier to brush out. Another great feature about this product is that is it USDA Organic, which helped finalize my purchasing decision. Overall Very satisfied with this product and purcahse!"
1268,great stuff_this is the first dry shampoo i try and it works great for me make my hair fresh and clean and soft very good i order two more bottles
9129,"BB creams are great!_I have been using Skin79 Super BB cream (a Korean brand) which I also buy on Amazon.  It's great at covering up red spots and has an SPF of 25.  I use it instead of make up now and it also promises 'wrinkle improvement'.  I wanted to try the Pond's because I have very fair skin and this came in 'light'.  I like it too, although its SPF is only 15 and it doesn't promise wrinkle improvement.  It goes on smoothly and blends in with my skin.  The coverage is less than that of the Super BB cream though and even though the Super BB cream comes out looking quite dark it seems to harmonize with my fair skin as I spread it around and looks just fine - very natural - hardly as though I'm wearing make up.  So, both are good but for Rosacea (of which I have a mild case) I think the Super BB Cream gives better coverage.  What I love though about both is being able to use just one product for foundation, sun protection, and (possible) wrinkle improvement."
8971,"Nice product_Melansol provides results similar to pure aloe vera.  I'm not sure what to make about the claims about its additional ingredients, but there is no doubt that aloe based products soothe pain and promote healing.  It has a pleasant smell, on the positive side, but is a slightly brownish color on the negative side.  (When in pain you will not care about the color, I suspect!)  I really appreciate that this is a cruelty-free product."
5497,"didn't work for me......_I have thin fine shoulder length hair with long layers.  This did nothing for me.  I can't use these type of bristles.  I need the hard plastic bristles.  I was going to return it but let my friend give it a try.  Her hair is thicker and she loved how it worked.  Guess I did something wrong, who knows......  she bought it from me.  I will stick to my very old ConAir hot air brush with the plastic bristles."
6954,"Great!_As will all PTR products - this eye serum is great. I love it. I would highly reccomend it to anyone (I'm early 30's) just wanting to do their part to prevent any fine lines from forming. I have no eye puffiness or dark circles so I'm not sure how it would have affected those, however, the skin around my eyes look dewy and healthy and fresh so I truly cannot complain..."
1030,I love these!_I used to take Nouritress vits. They were really expensive. I saw these in a beauty store and compared the ingredients...EXACT SAME. I bought Groganics and started taking them. I noticed my hair in better shape. It's growing a bit faster and it seems healthier. I've been taking them for months but this is my 1st time ordering them online I'm glad I found this seller as well. I received my item in a very timely manner. I will continue to take these vitamins and I'd order from this seller again!
2325,"Great_Same great product,  and for a great low price.  I would absolutely recommed to any of my friends any day."
4386,"This works with CONSISTENCY_I had a fresh mark on my back, I started using this item each day at night and it does work.  You have to be consistent.  What I like about this is that I use a q-tip and apply it to dry skin.  I am on my second bottle and I do believe that this works but you have to continue to use it, nothing works overnight so you have to tackle the mark immedialty."
1372,"Been using for a few years, still going strong_You'd think at some point you grow out of getting small zits, right?  Maybe some skin types don't, like mine, and I was tired of it.  When I buckled down and decided to use a single set of products religiously morning and evening, I picked up the Neutrogena grapefruit wash (morning), scrub (evening) and assorted moisturizers.  I can definitely claim it evened out my skin and there are almost no breakouts.  Good stuff, please don't ever change!"
3617,different finishes_These again smell great they are all roughly the same color but they do seem to very in the finish. Some are more shiny and one almost has a sparkle to it like a highlighter maybe. The do work well and are perfect travel size.
7134,"LIghtweight, Smooth Serum Works Well_I like the light, silky feel of this product. Serums that reduce frizz are often kind of 'heavy' and weigh the hair down. I've used this after a wash/blow dry and have been pleased with the results. You have to have a light hand on this kind of product--use a small bead about the size of a pea, then add more if needed (my hair is medium/short). The Motions Naturally You Hair Gloss adds a nice, pleasing shine to hair. Would definitely recommend. I've used several of these products from this line and have been pleasantly surprised with how they do not weigh my hair down overnight and require me to have to shampoo the next day. My hair is color-treated and I try to take very good care of it. This is one of the nicest products I've found in awhile for gloss and control. Would definitely recommend."
3262,"Must Have_I love this pencil and the color pay off is great. I use this to brighten up my eyeshadow colors, eyeliner, and sometimes as a base. This is a must have and it's really great."
9792,"Clean and refreshing_Clean, refreshing follow up and great companion to the face wash. Love this line.Started with the vitamin c serum and keep adding this line to my daily regimen. It truly is a greatproduct line at a great value,"
2923,Great mascara just like everyone says_I love this no clump fuss free mascara. It last and last and last until you wash it or water hits it. No smearing smudging or anything. Last for hours as long as you don't get it wet. Not waterproof. It does thicken for me as I already have long lashes. I don't know why I fool with any other mascara sometimes I have to have something that is waterproof but this is the best mascara in a long time.
8222,"I've tried all three and Cocoa is the best, but it's not perfect_I was drawn by the concept and I really like how easy it is to evenly apply the lotion. I was amazed because I finally saw what it meant for your skin to be moisturized versus it just sitting on top of your skin. This does soak in well. I ordered all three (Cocoa, Aloe and Oat Meal) just to see which one I liked. I'm surprised at all the reviews that the fragrance was too strong because they weren't to me. They were all very subtle and refreshing. BUT not all three moisturized equally. I rate cocoa the best at moisturizing, but I think that's because the spray worked better for some reason with that bottle. It came out as a fine mist and covered evenly.  The other two seemed to just pffth out (for lack of a better word) and left a runny wet mess. The oat meal was virtually gone and my skin was dry again before the end of the day. Aloe lasted a little longer, but Cocoa lasted the longest. It's a nice summer moisturizer and feels nice to wear with lighter clothes, but by no means will it do the job in winter if you have very dry skin, like I do (My skin cracks in winter and I have to use heavy duty stuff). You do have to be careful with overspray so I just stand on carpet when I put it on. Otherwise I can see it being way too slick and dangerous on bathroom tile.It was nice to use in hard to reach places and my skin felt immediately soft and smooth. It was nice being moisturized without feeling slick. Now I can appreciate the difference. I'll probably buy again, but just the cocoa and only in the summer."
9976,Great moisturizing soap_I absolutely love the Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap with Dead Sea Salt . This soap is gentle on my sensitive skin and does not have a smell to it.  I used it for two weeks as a daily facial cleanser.  It leaves the skin feeling not only cleansed but soft and not dry; which is important to healthy skin.
1700,"Good powder, better packaging needed_This powder where as well and is easy to apply. Personally I like to use a brush. It is awesome that you can find your TrueColor using this line. There are no guessing games, it is clearly listed on the compact what shaded is is either neutral cool or warm and what deepness it is. I give it four stars because the new packaging is annoying with the mirror on the back. If you use the mirror and the powder at the same time you constantly have to flip the compact over."
7320,Does the Job..._This shampoo did the trick on some pretty tough dandruff in about a week.  He had been using one of the major brands for a while without too much success so was pleasantly surprised that this worked so well.  The smell is nice and it's a creamy white consistency.  Recommend for man's tough dandruff and itchy scalp.
6871,love them_Love the brushes. Quality its to bad for the price. Makes my job easier. Price is great and came super fast. I was shocked. I would buy these again.
3274,Great for Thin Hair_I love the fact that when you order this product it comes with 60!! More than enough for one person. So I gave some to my sister and still have. More than enough :D
5723,The beautiful lipstick_The lipstick is a vibrant and elegant color that make my lips feel smooth and soft. I would definitely buy this brand again.
1150,"A good product, but too soon to tell._i love the way this cream smoothes onto my skin.  It leaves it feeling soft and I think it's a little firmer.  I haven't used it long enough  to know if it's reducing any wrinkles, and it really doesn't have an aroma as some creams do.  However, I'm quite pleased with the cream so far."
7254,"Great, Quick Dry!_The Remington D8410 Keratin Therapy Dryer is simply a great handheld dryer. Why?- 1875 Watts is powerful, and with multiple speed and heat settings you can get the perfect combination & and quick dry time.- It's light weight and the handle is comfortable in the hand.- Not too loud, even though it is powerful.-Large, easy to add diffuser leaves my wavy/curly hair thoroughly dried and still curly without frizz. Being able to adjust both the temp and the airflow allows the diffuser to work best.-I really like the idea that it is easy to clean the filter, as I have had multiple dryers that end up smelling like burnt hair because they are difficult to keep clear.And,  couple of things that could have been better, but still allow this to be a great purchase:- The diffuser is not included in the box, but the company offers a free diffuser at their website. I went to the company's website and applied the promotion code, but it didn't work.  I simply sent an e-mail to their Customer Service and immediately got a response that they would be sending me the diffuser at no charge. It arrived promptly within a few days.-The hype about this dryer is the featured 'Keratin Therapy', which I'm unsure about. The keratin-infused nozzle ring looks like an ordinary plastic ring at the end of the nozzle and I'm not convinced that it makes a huge difference in the end result, but it certainly doesn't do anything negative. There was nothing in the box to more fully describe the benefits of the dryer & ring, so all we have to go by are the basic claims on the box. It's probably not worth paying extra for, but the price for the dryer is reasonable.Overall, I would recommend for sure!"
6966,"Gentle on the skin and removes make-up with ease_I love these Biore Make-Up Removing Cleansing towelettes. I like the subtle scent, which is great considering I am not a fan of overpowering scents. The towelettes removed my make-up with ease and without me having to scrub too hard, and it felt nice on my skin, not abrasive. I was even able to use them around my eyes without having my sensitive eyes react adversely. For the price, these towelettes are a bargain compared to another pricier brand name I used before. I am switching over to these Biore towelettes from now on!"
9853,Great value and worked like a BOSS!_I have used other Argon oils int he past but they have left me greasy and with acne around my hairline. GROSS This one however was recommended by a friend of mine and she was on point. I use it on my hair my cuticles my elbows.. Super absorbent and effective. LOVE it Great value too
8214,"Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer - It Works_Vaseline's Spray and Go Moisturizer works for me. I'm always on the go and in a hurry. This product allows me to spray on my skin moisturizer. I love that it sprays because I can moisturize those dry areas on my back that I almost have to be a contortionist to reach otherwise. The fragrance is nice and light and perfect for all weather.Even though I was given a complimentary can from influenster, I love the product and have already purchased a can to keep on my desk at work. My hands get dry from shelving books and using commercial hand soap. Love it!"
2157,"Nice product_NOW solutions oils are great, they have a very decent packaging of the bottles and the oil feels fresh and pure. Castor oil is damn good for hair and I have been using this from childhood. Keeps hair away from pollution and chemicals. Hair appears dark and moisturised. Any castor oil has the same effects I believe."
9374,"Love the warm feeling_I've been enjoying these masks mostly because I really love any product that warms up. These are perfect for me in that regard; they do get nice and toasty.You apply to a damp face and the water is what activates the product. You massage it in for a minute and that seems to make it even warmer. Then you rinse it off right away. It comes off quite easy, no need for rubbing or scrubbing it off.As to the effectiveness, I can't say. My skin feels nice afterwards but not sure there is a discernible difference as far as blackheads go. I would get them again however because I really like them as part of a mini facial at home process."
5170,"Good quality_This curling wand is a pleasure to use. It has a perfect tension in the clamp,the weight is excellent and the handle is a comfortable thickness. The tip is tapered and should be longer it's not as long as the hot tools brand and several times I've touched the hot barrel.The cord is not a professional thickness like many other brands but the handle is proportioned better,not too thin, so it is easier to handle and maneuver. This gets piping hot really quickly for fast shiny 1 inch curls and it's a pretty blue color so it's easy to recognize from the other wands. I just purchased this and I've only used it about 4 times so far and I hope it lasts for a long time because it took a lot of effort to read many reviews and compare models before choosing this brand.I bought mine from Newvo Beauty for 29.95 and the delivery was really fast. Yes that's right I included my opinion of the seller in my product review because contrary to what many phoney reviewers rant, the seller quality is half of the value of any item purchased online and one shouldn't have to search the site to verify the sellers service rating and legitimacy.That being said this review has gone on long enough ;)"
3763,"Love this oil....._I purchased this product to use on my dry feet, and yes it does what it says! I've actually mixed it with my other lotion just to make it last a little longer. But yes this oil is great!"
4778,"Perfect!!_Absolutely love this dryer. It is quiet, NOT too heavy (unless you're just used to lifting pearls to your head or something...) and quick, efficient, and though not noticeably effective in producing shine, unlike more intense dryers, does not produce as many split ends, frizz, etc. LOVE LOVE LOVE this dryer."
4399,"Not for me, thank you_So incredibly bad smelling that I threw it away. The product didn't work on my fine, straight hair and I smelled of the product all day. It's a good way to have people avoid you all day."
631,"This is so cool!_I don't know what people mean when they say you need two different kinds of curlers. I love this one alone! You do need to put your mascara on first, then use it. That helps set the curl so that it lasts.it even helps me deal with a few wonky lashes that would rather turn inward!"
9800,"One of my Favorite Natural Products_Vitamin C Serum has tons of benefits:Skin-firmingAnti-agingBrightens complexionHydrates skinEvens skin toneDiminishes dark spots, marks, and patchesReduces appearance of wrinklesI'll always have a bottle on hand because it has improved the appearance of my skin. I love using Instanatural's Vitamin C Serum!"
9128,"big fan of pond's facial sunscreens_I'm a big fan of the Pond's facial sunscreens and moisturizers.I decided to review this tinted one.  Instead of making my face look white, like the zinc-based sunscreen I usually use, this makes it look, well, skin tone.If you heap it on, it appears more like makeup, but with a light coat it disappears, leaving an even appearance.  I think it may hide the scar on my forehead a little.I like these sunscreens because they are not greasy, but seem to look good by giving your skin just a little bit of shine.I also love the size and design of the container.  The top stays on even when travelling.  It is flat and fits in my bags easily when I travel.Recommended."
2253,"For those who hate Glossy, Sparkly lip gloss..._I got this product as a free sample, I would not have bought it otherwise because I don't like the feel or look of most lip glosses. I usually use lip liner and rub Aquaphor on for a very slight gloss effect, problem is it looks great but washes off too soon.This product gives that perfect hint of subtle, pretty lip color with slight shine and there is no glittery watery look to it like their is to most glosses. It made my lips look plump and healthy.The gloss smells nice, is hardly sticky, and you need only a tiny bit of it. It stays on well.I have medium/olive skin and use the Bare Beige color. It looks very dark in the tube but doesn't come out that way."
387,"My one and only eyeliner!_I absolutely love this eyeliner.  And here is why.  I've started wearing make up pretty young. However not until 3 years ago was I able to start using liquid eyeliner.  Not sure why, but I always had trouble with eyeliners particularly liquid. I always had to just limit myself with the pencil or wet eye shadows and angled brush.  I'm not even sure why it was such a challenge for me.  I guess the brush applicators were just way too soft and I have never had a steady hand, and my lids I guess you could say a bit wrinkly.  So all in all no matter what I tried liquid never worked for me, the end result would always be disastrous and I would have to start from the beginning.  That is until I watched YouTube video tutorial where the guru showed eyeliner that is perfect for beginners and the brand was Prestige.  Thinking I have nothing to lose I bought it next day in the pharmacy, and have been using ever since!  I believe what is different about this particular eyeliner is the very stiff brush with soft ending.  It works pretty much like a pencil, except its liquid!I also own this eyeliner in dark brown and icon color, which is like a mix of burgundy and purple.  The color payoff for all 3 is really great.  It takes some time to dry, I would say at least 30-40 seconds depending on the thickness of the line.  Of course this is not expensive name brand eyeliner, so it probably doesn't last as long.  However it'll definitely stay on for at least 6 to 7 hours and I always have it on me to reapply.  All in all this is very good eyeliner for a small price.  100% recommend!"
1891,"More than worth it!_What can i say that the others have not? This looks so nice, is very sturdy and lightweight. I put my cotton balls in here instead of q-tips. Love it & no complaints!"
9671,"is this for you_Do you have age spots, wrinkles, or dark under eye circles. This product is for you!!!! I quit ALL my face regiments to see it this truly worked, to my surprise it worked on my fine lines by my mouth and on my forehead. This bottle is 2x bigger than most. I love the scent its very refreshing. It also not clear its a cloudy color. It goes on smooth and soaks into the skin. It hydrated my face after my first use. No pain or burning sensation during application and no sticky feeling afterwards. This is a huge value on price and the size of the vitamin c because you only need a few drops each time. Also comes with a money back guarantee if your not happy with the product. I love the fact that the company doesn't test products on animals. I'm a big animal lover, I love them so much even when I see hurt, abandoned, and lost animals I stop and help it. The packaging was great and the product came on time with no problems or defects. I recommend to people with age spots or wrinkles."
7057,"Great quality wig_I love the style and the color. (I got the fall leaf colors and it's just gorgeous) it fits really well, no need for glue or tape. I like a snug fit, (my hair is extremely short after shaving it off when I had skin cancer so most other wigs slip and slide because there is no hair to clip into) But this is nicely fitted without being overly tight.Very light shedding. I have some wigs that rain loose hair. this one barely sheds at all. So it is an excellent quality wig. I'd get it again in another color without hesitation!"
2654,"Wonderful_Great stuff.  It is a little more fragranced than I like, but it is manageable.  It feels good putting it on, and it does improve the appearance of my skin."
1618,"recovery mask_havent tried it yet, but it smells pretty good. bought it for a gift for a friend since we both fry our hair lol"
1897,Softer Skin_My dry skin soaks this Raw Shea Butter Wash like a sponge.  My skin feels so smooth and has a very light pleasing fragrance.  I gave a bottle to a friend for her birthday.
6275,"Been Using for 7 years_Used this soap since I was 14. I'm 21 now. It's the only soap my mom and I will use! It's gentle on your skin (I have very sensitive skin) and it leaves your skin soft and smelling great all day. Lasts a pretty long time if you have a draining soap dish. And it lathers soo well if you use it with a shower pouffe. It's a little more on the expensive side, but it's worth it because my skin is never irritated or dry."
6005,"someday amazed_I love someday by Justin bieber. It is a nice fruity and floral sent. With a little vaniella. This perfume is s perfect gift for any girl or woman. You may think its made for girls and teens, but its made for everyone. You will deffently fall in love with someday."
733,I love this!_I purchased this a while ago so that I could take it on the road with me (when I was working as a flight attendant).This blowdryer is really good! So good that I use it all the time at home now.
9397,Love Vitamin C_Love this product makes my skin feel really nice and smells really good see some results but I know i need to use this longer.
8188,"Shany Cosmetics Nail Art Manicure Fimo Canes, Sticks, and Rod Gel Tips_I Love my nail art manicure fimo canes sticks and rod gel tips. There so awesome to wear on fingernails and your toenails very easy to cut them i love to cut them thin . I receveid my order very early . I Do Thank You so much ."
2449,"Great for Dry, Chapped Hands_This moisturizing hand balm repair is great for people with dry, chapped hands.Using dish washing liquid for my dishes, anti-bacterial soap and other cleaning tasks can really irritate the hands, sometimes becoming painful and cracked.This cream works wonders on dry hands. It contains fig extract,vanilla extract, shea butter and aloe. It has a subtle hint of fragrance in a fluffy and light cream which is very pleasant."
7750,"Four stars so far_I'm enjoying this face cream. It has a bracing feeling when I put it on and it keeps my skin from feeling dry. I'm not sure that even the month given for review time would be enough to see real results. I've been using it for five days and I have not noticed anything yet. The scent is pleasant enough, if perfumey. I assume it increases blood flow to the skin, thus the bracing sense. The jar is very pretty to leave on the bathroom shelf. Like many of these products, it's a bit pricier than plain moisturizer, but much cheaper than high end wrinkle creams, so the price is okay. I am not entirely comfortable with not recognizing any of the ingredients -- nothing natural? Really? It would not be my choice for long-term use for that reason. Unless it's phenomenal. I'll update in another few weeks.I should mention that it *could* be causing my skin to break out. I have to look into that."
3951,"Excellent product_This is one of the best body and face washes I've ever used.  Great scent and feels great on the skin.Dove has the best products available.Smooth, no residue and smells great."
611,"Great Product_This stuff helps my dry damaged hair look and feel healthy which is exactly what I was looking for, good stuff"
6296,"Exceeded expectations in every way._I enjoy this polish so much I bought another for a friend.  The glitters are super-micro black with larger hex black dot glitters that are still quite small.  This is not a glitter top coat that screams at you, but something that just adds a bit of character to your base color.  Slightly sexy in the black, without being obnoxious.  Looks beautiful over classic shades (got a perfect red?  add this!)  and adds some funky fun to neons and bright cremes.  A must-have for any collection."
9709,"Pampering nutrition for your hair and scalp_This mask is a great complement to the Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing shampoo and conditioner, I've been using said products during the last three weeks and I like them a lot.  This is a treatment that works better if one takes a little time to let it penetrate into the hair. What I do is that the day I'm staying home doing house cleaning, after I wash my hair, I generously apply the Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Mask to my hair, and wrap it in a towel. Then I go and do the housework, which could take hours. The heat that the exercise I'm doing while cleaning produce in my scalp, helps the hair to absorb the benefits from the mask. When I'm done with the house, I take another shower and rise out the treatment from my hair. Afterward, my hair is ready for any type of styling I might wish."
3700,Good product_I read about this particular flat iron on a list detailing the top tech products of 2010. It heats up really quickly and gets extremely hot. I have very thick hair and it did a great job of straightening it. My hair also stayed shiny and straight for days afterward. I would definitely recommend this product to others.
536,Great When Ounces Count_I got these for my emergency kits and for camping.  I could have easily bought a big bottle of sunscreen for next to nothing but when hiking every ounce makes a difference.  These work great; weigh next to nothing and save you from sun burn or worse.  I also keep these in my first aid kits and car and they have come in handy many times.  They are pricy but when used for the right reasons the price is worth it.I recommend this to all.
9825,LOVE THIS!_I love how amazing the 100% Pure Moroccan Rose Water by Insta Natural  feels on y skin. I use so many products trying to give my skin the best glo and never realized how harsh it all ways. Once I started using 100% Pure Moroccan Rose Water by Insta Natural  I will no longer be going back to any of those others.
6320,Best concealer ever_I absolutely love this concealer.  It is the only concealer I have ever had that can hide even the worst bight marks on my neck.  It matches my skin perfectly which is hard to find sometimes because I tan and a lot of makeup just looks orange.  This stuff covers every imperfection perfectly.  I love that the little pencil can cover up the most impossible blemishes.  I can't live without it I have two in my makeup drawer right now.
9413,"I LOVE this stuff!_It's not until I've been using something on my skin for a while that I really know how I feel about it.  When the bottle is getting low and I don't really care... I didn't love it, but when the bottle gets low and I start thinking, &#34;I've got to order some more of this,&#34; I know it's a really good product.  This is a really good product!I use it before I put on my moisturizer and it really makes my skin feel soft.  Hyaluronic Acid is an oil that our skin produces when we are younger that helps the cells stay plump and soft, but as we age it diminishes (like so many things!)  When I first started using it my skin felt better, but it wasn't until after I had been using it for a few months that I realized how much better it made my skin look.  It's not a miracle - I don't look ten years younger, but my skin looks brighter and smoother - it just looks fresher!  I am definitely putting this into my permanent routine.My only issue with this brand is the delivery method:  instead of a pump bottle, it has an eyedropper cap.  This makes for a somewhat messy process when the bottle is full.  Every time you put the eyedropper into the bottle a bit of the serum wells up and over the lip.  I lost a little bit of this precious gel every time I used it, plus I had to constantly wipe the top of the bottle before capping it each time.  I prefer a pump bottle because you can get precisely the same amount every time, it's never messy, and you don't waste any (I always take the top off of pump bottles and turn them upside down to get the final bit out of them.)Other than the eyedropper, this is an amazingly good serum and my skin adores it!"
9567,Another great Axe product_I love the way this gel lathers and the way it smells. I can't really detect the citrus but I definitely like the ginger and pepper combination. It is masculine smelling without being overpowering. It leaves a nice subtle scent behind on your skin.
9865,"Smooth, Fresh, Love the Lilac scent!_My Skin feels amazing, smells like fresh lilac. LOVE IT! Smooth. fresh. can't wait to see what my face will feel like long term! I love it! I have had my mom try it and she loves it too! We will be coming back for more of  this stuff!!"
7258,"Can't be beat!_I use Vaseline as a moisturizer, chap stick, and even use it on my little girl's hair to tame the frizz. I have tried many store brands but nothing compares to Vaseline."
1976,love it_I compared this with my black nail polish and the stamp comes out much thicker in color. I am definitely sticking to this.
1109,"For best results, use with Vit. C serums_Because i work in the beauty industry here in New York, i see all the behind-the-scenes secrets: Incestuous suppliers, do-nothing formulas, and idiotic marketing hype. Therefore, I normally don't push products, being so jaded.BUT... I've actually fallen in love with the Clarisonic, a rotating brush head cleanser that's powered by ultrasonic waves, by the same maker as SonicCare toothbrushes. you may have heard of it, and piqued by the testimonials. And I attest to its power. Why?My uncle is a plastic surgeon with a skincare clinic and has been promoting ultrasonic plated devices for *years* to help products penetrate the skin better. (Imagine a Clarisonic with a flat metal head, no bristles --I've used this type of device to massage serums into my skin.) I am witness to the results from my own family members and his patients --seeing a huge difference in glow, firmness, texture, and brightness to their skin due to improved Vit. C serum absorption. Think of it this way--most cremes and potions sit on top of the skin, rarely penetrating through the top layers of dead skin cells to actually work. The ultrasonic waves help push the product into the skin more than using fingers.The Clarisonic takes this concept one up, starting with the cleansing step:Rotating bristles with ultrasonic power to remove the dead skin cells in the first place.The result is more thorough deep cleansing than washing by hand. Dirt and debris get whisked away, pores are massaged and stimulated (you will notice that blackheads are easier to remove or are slightly reduced), and overall skin health is brighter and improved! and the best part is that serums/cremes/moisturizers SINK in immediately after cleansing --- skin soaks it right up b/c it's prepped, no dead cell blockage, andit's ready to receive your choice of anti-aging solutions.Therefore, I would not recommend using any old moisturizer. After all, the Clarisonic study was conducted using Vitamin C penetration levels and showed some 40-60% increase in absorption, so why use a run-of-the-mill moisturizer afterwards?  This is where your actives come into play: Antioxidants, Retinol, Peptides, etc.  My uncle also uses the Vitamin C serums on his patients b/c it is one of the few things that is proven to work in clinical trials as an anti-aging superpower.  You must be sure to get the stabilized kind, such as Phytoceuticals C+E serum, (i think it's 10-15% vitamin C) created by the doctor who first stabilized Vitamin C and then patented it. He originally founded Skinceuticals, then defected to form Phytoceuticals.After using the Clarisonic with my C serum for one month, my skin is so smooth and glowing with a brightness i had not seen before. I went back home for the holidays and everyone was commenting on my skin. Again, this is due to improved product penetration.I tried the Clarisonic on my body, and afterwards my skin was so smooth and my typically greasybody butter absorbed right away instead of sitting on top of my skin. But i don't have the patience to sonic-fy my body every day (way too time-consuming).Buying or using the Clarisonic brand cleanser is not necessary - it's a non-lathering milky cleanser similar to Cetaphil. I still recommend using a makeup remover *before* cleansing.I've also heard that it clears up Keratosis Pilaris (chicken skin bumps, usually on back of arms), only if you are diligent about it. I can see why this would potentially work.Using the Clarisonic takes patience every day to go thru the routine and massage and circle your skin in small motions. Many times, after the 'honeymoon' factor, we tend to get tired and just want to take shortcuts.However, the Clarisonic does not cure acne--the cystic kind, superficial kind, hormonal kind, or any kind. Believe me, if it did, i'd give it 5 stars.Hey, this machine ain't the holy grail--but it's pretty close."
2207,fast dry_Magic in a bottle.  My favorite top coat in the whole world.. it will not fail you. Super fast dry.
1657,"IT'S NOT ORGANIC_I GOT FOOLED BUT THE NAME ORGANIX,  IT HAS MANY CHEMICALS, I AM ALLERGIC TO MOST CONDITIONERS EVEN ORGANIC SO I THREW IT OUT."
5400,"my favorite color_i knew it was matte before i bought it but who doesn't put a top coat anyway? amazing color, my favorite. so inexpensive and good quality... love it!"
8684,"nice followup to Tresemme Keratin Smooth Shampoo_I fell in love with Tresemme Keratin Smooth Shampoo and have found the Infusing Serum from the same product line to be a very nice followup.I usually prefer a thick, heavy-duty frizz-control serum but this seem to accomplish similar results without the stickiness."
1871,Smells just like lily of the valley_Smells so good.  A little over powering but it fades a little faster than I'd like.  I gave it four stars because it fades fast and because the bottle came bubble wrapped without a box.  I don't know if that's normal.  I'm used to perfume coming in a box
879,"No more dry scalp!_I'm a product junkie but have stayed with this shampoo for at least four years because it works. I've run out a couple times and my dry scalp comes right back, so I've learned to always have an extra on hand. The smell is nice and it works better than any other more expensive brands. My hair is long and wavy and combining this with the conditioner does a great job!"
6923,"Would not buy again_I was bored with just painting my nails, so I wanted to try something new. While the idea was interesting to me, the execution of it did not impress me enough to keep buying similar products.As far as this particular prodcut goes, it mainly contains the tiny flowers, which are hard, if not impossible, to use in nail art, at least for me. I've used the bigger ones to decorate my nails, but the flowers did not stay on as long as my shellac manicure did. They started pealing off ruining my manicure.Thus, I won't be purchasing anything like this in the future. I'll stick to purchasing more different nail colors!"
8046,"Feels great_I like the way it smells, and it feels good, not too greasy. Feels thicker than a normal conditioner. Rinses out well, and my hair is easy to comb and not too fly-away. Haven't really used it long enough to decide if it truly lives up to its claims, but so far so good."
6503,"Did not like_Arrived in a timely manner. It is, however, very sweet and heavy oil, almost smells like a sweet snow cone, or cotton candy. Not the scent I was going for. Very disappointed."
7675,"Lots of uses_Funny thing. I never use this for hair. i use it to bath , shave my legs and it is so pure you can use it on your body anywhere. Love the fragrance.. So Pepperminty."
765,"nice_I really like the color of the bronzer and how it highlights my cheekbones. However, the bronzer fades faster than other bronzers that cost the same."
7073,"Shipping, Quality, Reaction!_Shipping was actually really fast- it came super early! I'm very pleased!I got it for my boyfriend and he said it works really well! I haven't tried it myself- but he says it works!I like it a lot- his face is a lot clearer now!"
6917,"Works well - makes beautiful, long lasting waves_My teenage daughter has been using this.  It heats up quickly and is easy to use.  She has medium-long hair.  The waves are beautiful and last well.  She really likes the Goody Heat Natural Waves Curling Iron."
9115,"I love it!!!_Of course!! It is a Britney's perfume, so I couldn't expect less that this perfect and delicious perfume. I recomend it for Britney's fans like me Lol!! It is worth it to get it. If you haven't gotten any Britney's perfume before, you should try this one. It goes perfectly for summer days. I love the bottle!! I got perfect on time and with a super nice wrap."
7545,"Smells Amazing_This is the best smelling body wash I've ever had - it really makes the shower enjoyable, lathers well, doesn't cause breakouts, etc. Go for it! And it's pink!"
1479,"Lotta Body Setting Lotion_Great product that really holds.  It's enabled me to try some new styles in the hottest and most humid summertime weather,  And the styles held up for hours!  I highly recommend!"
8505,"Really Helps With Oily Hair_The Axe Defying Dust seems like baby powder when you first apply it.  It really does a good job of absorbing oil in your hair.The only issue that I had was that it felt kind of tacky after I rubbed it into my hair.  I suppose that is the trade off for not having an oil slick, flat hairdo!I definitely recommend for people with very oily, straight hair."
3288,"excellent product_Lets see, where to begin. I live in Florida where we need sunscreen year round, especially if your outdoors a lot. Aside from working I ride my mountain bike 100-200 miles per week (combination of trail and road, needless to say suncreen is important. This year I think I have tried every sunscreen on the market, literetly. All neutorgena products eventually made my eyes swell and constant water, aveeno did the same, as did olay, and every other brand on the shelf. One day I purchased Blue Lizard sensitive skin , as I thought it was a pretty safe product, and it is. However, I apply sunscreen every 2 hours when I am in the sun (as suggested) and the blue lizard seemed to get pretty greasy, to the point that I was taking a paper towel and pat my entire face to try and soak some of it up.Fallene products went on smoothly but dried my face out, as did the blue lizzard. Vanicream was nice, but greasy as well.  I began to try products like badger and beyond coastal when I accidentlly came across the EWG website listing the 2010 best/safest sunscreen products.At the very top is sweetsation products. ALthough more money on intial cost, you actually are spending less because you need less. The products ingredients are all truly organic and that is why EWG name it top sunscreen/moisteruizer (spelling error).The SPF 50 is easier to spread than the SPF30. The product blends in immedietly, does not make your face feel greasy, and last along time (even for me riding 2-3 hours in 90 degree weather). I have not felt any stinging in my eyes or flushing on my skin. Absolutely no effects like every other sunscreen on the market has given me. I am not someone who likes strong frangrances, and this product does not have that at all.At first, it will leave a white cast, but if you gently rub it in and wait a few minutes the ghostly look goes away. The slightly white cast is worth the quality of the product.When I first bought the SPF 30 I was thrown off a bit applying it, as it seemed to clump up on my face. The clumps would go away once I was able to rub them in, but had to wait a few minutes. My face immedietly had this new glow to it, I truly had not seen my face look this fresh in years (33 years old now). I am not pregant, but since I ride my bike so much in the sun I have become concerned about my health and the safety of the products I use. Sweetsation products are the safest and do wonders for your skin. I find my face to have this fresh look, like a healthy glow. I have noticed friends looking at me, one friend told me how healthy my face looked. She commented as soon as she saw me that morning. I didn't even mention to her anything about applying anything.Anyway, I really liked the SPF 30 and didn't want to return so I emailed the company at the sweetsation therapy website directly, on a Saturday evening a couple of weeks ago actually. Too my surpise, about an hour later my phone had an incoming email, and it was from the owner of Sweetsation Therapy. Her email response was very impressive, how many businesses will email their clients on the weekends? not many. She gave me very helpful tips; suggested only apply a pea size or less at a time or putting a serum or day cream on first. This worked very well (the pea size amount) and no clumping at all. I was truly impressed with the cutsomer service. Since that Saturday (1-2 weeks ago) I have asked the owner a few more questions and she has always responded, never missed a question.Sweetsation products are truly great. Even if your not in the sun everyday, the products are worth every penny. They last a very long time, longer than over the counter products and most others."
5544,"Smells great and works if you follow directions_It smells great, and it does seem to help my hair feel softer and healthier.  For the price, it is a good product.  I would recommend it."
41,"neutrogene oil free moisture sensitive skin_I chose tiis moisturizer because it did not have SPF in it and it was advertised as not to clog the pore on my face.  I seems a little more pricey than Oil of Olay.  I have always used a moisturizer after shaving, it does a far better job of soothing the skin thanalcohol based products P.S. after about 1/2 of the bottle the pump no longer will pump and you are left with 1/2 bottle that you have to beat out with your hand to get it.... I won't make this mistake again of ordering this... Shame of them..."
9409,"Lightweight and nice shine. Helped with frizzed gray hair, too._I tried this out while visiting the East Coast during the recent freeze. My skin was dry and my short, gray hair frizzed. This worked very well on my hair- I used a small grape-sized amount on damp hair. The shorter pieces lay flat, the texture was softer, and my hair had a nice shine to it.True story: First day I used this, some guy came up to me at a restaurant and said I had &#34;lovely hair- just beautiful.&#34; My mom and I had a good laugh and she said it was because of the hair cream."
7551,"i wouldnt know_I don't really know what to say about this, never got to use it.  I was very very very disappointed."
5396,Smelled Like Cleaning Product_Smells like cleaning fluid and not a bit alluring even for toilet scrubbing ! Do not like this at all .
1330,Loved it_This is incredible soap.  It not only cleans your face but it makes your skin glow and clearer at the same time.I loved it.
1614,Love It!!!!!_I like the way it smells. I also love the way it made my ends shine and look healthy. I love all the S factor products.
7698,"replaces expensive retinol creams_I used to by retinol creams at 4 - 10 times the cost of this. I bought to try and see if it was as good.  I have used daily for 1 year now. The cream works great, my skin looks and feels exactly the same as when i used the other creams.  The only difference is there is no tingling or burning sensation after i apply.  The other creams state this is a sign the retinol is working but as my skin has not developed any new wrinkles or sagging in the last year i have used this product, tingling and burning sensations do not appear to be necessary.The money saved is incredible."
9611,"very soft, but not exfoliating_I liked the cleansing wipes. They are very soft and did a pretty good job getting my makeup off. That being said, I don't feel like this can replace an exfoliating face wash or wipe. I still felt like I need to use something else too wash my face after."
4101,"AMazing_I love this gel eyeliner so much! I bought the black one and it comes on so smooth and elegant-looking. It was my first time using a gel eyeliner and I'm glad I bought this one! As a makeup beginner, I didn't use any primer or powder to help it set or look more smoother. I don't really think there is a need to. I used this for prom and my eyeliner stayed on the whole day and night! Also, the brush that came with it works really well with the gel eyeliner. It was easy to control and helps achieve the &#34;winged&#34; eyeliner. Plus, you can make it as dramatic as you want by applying more. I made my eyeliner shade in between soft and dramatic and it was the perfect shade for me."
1355,"LOOOVEE IITTT!_I have naturally curly hair, if I were to label it i would say it's in between a 4a and 4b. I felt instant moisture when I used this Conditioner and I didn't even use it as directed (under a dryer).  My hair hasn't been this soft since I was a child and I love it!"
5018,"great!_This is perfect for my VERY oily hair. My hair has to be washed daily because it is so oily. This does not make me feel like a friz head, but it keeps my hair soft, while taking the oily feeling away."
2625,"Great for oily skin!_I was really surprised at the texture - it is like a mud mask texture and very nice! I have oily skin. I don't suffer from many breakouts but I do always have a shine to my face. This product is great for oily skin. My skin is also sensitive and this did not bother it. This felt like a spa treatment. I can tell that it works really well so it may not be a good idea to use every single day but every other day perhaps. Some of the reviewers said it dried their skin... just don't use it excessively and yes it's made for oily skin. So if you don't have oily skin, don't use it. It was thick and smooth and didn't have a smell. I really liked how it felt and will continue to use this product. I love the 100% pure brand products and all my cosmetics are from them."
4164,"makes my skin smoother and tighter_I've only used this one day, but so far I'm impressed.  My skin seems a little smoother and tighter.  My lines a little less pronounced."
6860,"Blinging_got this to bling a phone cover for my sister, i cant find one for her phone already done, great price and fast shipping"
7702,"Great Nail Polish_I have gone through many different types of nail polish over the years, and so far China Glaze is my all time favorite. They go on real smooth, and take forever to start chipping when I apply after the proper steps are taken."
9690,"Dry Oil means feels like a regular conditioner_Apparently what dove did here was put oil directly into a conditioner and make it feel to the touch like a regular conditioner. This means that you can use this instead of those tubes of oil that are sold for the hair as oil treatments.  I am not a chemist so I cannot tell you if the two products achieve exactly the same thing.  I did use this though and it does put a fair amount of oil in your hair without overdoing it. I just ran my fingers through my hair a day after using it and my hair definitely feels oilier.  It is not dry at all and I have senior gray hair. So if you want to put oil on your hair without using those messy tubes filled with oil, this is one solution.  I can't say that I would run out and buy this on my own. I really don't need a lot of extra oil in my hair.  But as an occasional thing, it is fine."
5922,"Great_I use emu oil on cuts, burns, scraps, blemishes, and my hair. It makes an injury heal ten times faster. I love this stuff."
6948,"Revlon Photoready Perfecting Primer_When compairing face primers, I search for quality and price. I originally purchased the Revlon Photoready Perfecting Primer from a local Rite Aide on sale. I tried it, it has a light hint of color that blends into your skin, once it is evenly applied. I am light skinned, so it blended very well, giving a natural look. I used Revlon Mineral loose powder over the primer and it gave me a very beautiful and flawless finish. I used Revlon products, because it does what the product indicates, However if you have a different brand it may work just as well with the Revlon Photoready Perfecting Primer. Keep in mind, this review is based on my personal experience i have had with this particular product! Everyones skin type is different, and what works well for one, may not be the same for someone else. Overall, I would recommed this product to anyone because it holds true to what it says it can do. It gives that flawless and photoready look that most women want. It is inexensive on Amazon, so you can't go wrong. Compaired to higher end face primers on the market, it's a great value and great results."
3737,"It's fun to play with_It's fun to play with, and it makes beautiful nail arts. I have many compliments every time I put on new nail arts. A great buy!"
6891,"Skin feels good_Growing up, I rarely ever had problems with acne.  However, as an adult I have a little acne problem on my forehead and a little on my nose, along with a very occasional problem elsewhere.  I like to have a matte appearance, so shine control is important to me.I have been using the Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash for a few weeks.  It seemed to clear up most of my forehead, and I haven't had problems anywhere else on my face yet.  I don't know that it controls shine, but I'm happy that it is controlling the acne problem.It also has a light, clean, almost florally smell to it.  It has a very pretty smell, but it's not overwhelming.  It's definitely not masculine!!!I think the only thing I didn't really like about it is that the foam goes away pretty quickly and it's hard to tell if you have actual product on your hands/face or if it's just water.  I know that lather isn't necessary to clean, but it can be a little difficult knowing if you are using enough.  Even with that, I plan to find the matching moisturizer to try and will definitely continue using the Dermacontrol foam wash!!!"
9859,"Very Effective!_I am in my forties and I like using products that are chemical free. I like that this is organic, unrefined and all natural. It has no scent and that is fine with me. I had a bottle of Rosehip oil from another brand and it has a fishy smell. Although the smell goes away after application, I like VoilaVe's Rosehip oil more. I use it as a facial moisturizer and for my nails. I like that it leaves my skin soft and smooth. My nails are much stronger now and I can afford to grow them longer because they don't crack up easily.My crow's feet are also a bit lighter. Well, they are still visible, but I have seen improvements. I am positive that if I continue to use it, they will become less noticeable."
3648,Good For Oily Skin_My daughter has never been able to use a moisturizer without a strong increase in skin blemishes. She has problem acne that does not respond to OTC treatments or prescription creams (We've tried them all). On a whim I bought her The Body Shop Tea Tree Oil sample pack and noticed an immediate difference in her skin. After three months of consistent use of the three core product her skin is 80% clear. We are going to add the face mask next and see if we can get the other 20% under control. She uses this moisturizer after the toner to soothe the effect of multiple tea tree oil products. Definitely has made her more confident!
546,"Great staple_Good for co-washing, detangling, deep conditioner. Work well on low porosity hair. Great value, smells great. Heavy, thick, and creamy."
6478,"Pretty good for what they are_I tried these exfoliating wipes and found they do a decent job. They are a little rough but not too rough and I love that they don't have any fragrance to them. While I still prefer exfoliating facial and body scrubs, these are nice when you travel or don't feel like going through the whole bedtime ritual."
6067,very good eyeliner_This is a very nice eyeliner. It glides on and there is no tugging on your eyelid. Its a good product especially for the price and i will be purchasing more.
3198,"A fine grade of Tea Tree Oil_I am a long time user of tea tree oil, and found this bottle to be particularly strong and potent, which I like. I took the advice of one of the reviewers and applied it to a couple of tags that were starting to appear and am glad to report they went away. But I must say I did employ another method along with it and that was black Jamaican oil so I would recommend the combo, however as a anti fungal preparation it is unparalleled it has a host of uses, just google and you will find that it is most useful in so many ways. I recommend."
1895,"Best smelling lotion_I've tried a ton of bronzing tanning lotions in all price ranges and rarely notice a difference in how well they work for me.  This lotion is so silky when you put it on and it has very little after-tan smell.  This one has been my favorite for at least a year; however I recently received a sample of another lotion and finally saw a difference in my tan, so I have switched to that as my primary lotion as it is also cheaper.  Tanning lotion preferences vary by person, but this is one that I would recommend for the great scent, lack of after tan smell, and silky feeling.  I'll keep it in my repertoire to mix it up."
771,I love Dove!_Dove is (and has always been) one of my favorite brands of body wash. The Deep Moisture Nourishing 24 ounce bottle comes in handy for my dry skin. The winter months are rough on my skin so a nice moisturizing body wash like Dove is essential (along with good lotion). This Dove body wash cleans and moisturizes with a great scent while rinsing clean. Dove is always a necessary item for me year round.
467,"It is an interesting product_I am not sure if it works or going to work.  The only problem I have with the product is I don't like taking vitamins all day.  I prefer to take vitamins and supplements in the morning and be done with it.  This product requires you take it morning, noon, and evening a no go in my book, all because I have a bad habit of forgetting to take them or just don't feel like so it is best that I go back to my original hair vitamins.  I will finish the bottle because I bought it but afterwards I will go back to my other hair vitamins that has worked for me.  If you want to try it go for it if it works stick with it.  I give it 4 stars because I do believe when I finish the bottle I will see results and that is what you look for when you buy products is results so if you are okay with 3 vitamins a day and are more committed to the direction buy this product and enjoy."
2218,"CHEAP, MOVE AND FRIZZ UP YOUR HAIR!_**********FALSE ADVERTISING. THEY ARE JUST OLD STYLE FROM THE 80'S CHEAP ROLLERS THAT DON'T EVEN WORK/DON'T HOLD AND MAKE MY HAIR FRIZZY. THEY'RE LIKE $2 WORTH. I AM SO UPSET. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!*******SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET SECURE HOLD CLIPS BECAUSE THESE MOVE AROUNG AND FRIZZ UP YOUR HAIR*********NOT WHAT THEY SAY THEY ARE!!!"
5369,Everything You Need_This was a surprise to get! The designs are wonderful and the plates are metal so they will last for a very long time! I am so happy that I purchased this for a gift!
7736,"You will either love it or hate it_I like how AXE uses different ingrediants to compliment their body washes. It makes me feel like I am not just using soap on my body. For 'Cool Metal' there is Zinc and Quarts ground up into powder and blended in with the soap. As far as the benefits of this I dont know, but what I do know is the smell is quite unique. You are either going to love it or hate it, plain and simple. I am sort of on the fence with it. Some days I am in the mood for it, and other days I am not. It would be unfair for me to give this anything less than 5 stars because I never smelled it prior to ordering it on Amazon. The way I see it is that it's soap, and it will run out sooner or later and you can always try something new. I would roll the dice on this if you are up to it."
3799,"Best Thank GOD_Ok, I used to go to the best salon's, then I didn't feel well because I am being treated for lyme disease, you get by Tick bites, it often is mistaked for MS or Fibromyalgia (that's what they said I had until I sought a specialist, as I live in CA and it is ALL OVER THE USA) it takes years to get well, so I like to let people know about that, so they may also get well.ANYWAY, I adore the product I have it on once a month auto delivery. I have Scotch/Irish background so things tend to go Brassy. I use Miss Clairol Dusk Blonde with 40 percent Oreal peroxcide, keep it on two hours I have brown hair naturally.If I feel like highlights I use quick blue and 40% for 10 mintues. Then THIS[...]WOW No NO NO Brassy. And with Auburn hair it tends to need Ash's 8 1/2 ash, aka Dusk Blonde.No hair damage no nothing, I love it. I look just like I want, Claudia Shiffer Hair! But I NEED THIS, and have not one bad thing to say at all.I have thick wavy hair, and it is controlled by Shishado's um red box shampoo, conditioner and I add the Shine it comes with if you buy that box the red one and leave some of that on for non drying hair.I like it better than the finest salons and I am so serious. It's WAY less [...] even though yeah this all adds up it works perfectly for way longer. I mean no tips ect. Used to be in the thousands to get my hair colored, not it's under 100 for months if I buy in bulk. Very Happy."
2155,"Perfect_This is my first time purchasing castor oil, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I love this product and will be sticking with the NOW brand. The packing is wonderful. The product is amazingly smooth, clean and silky. I am so pleased."
5824,"So far so good_Just bought this about two weeks ago and so far I see a slight difference. I have only been using once a day, but am already hopeful that this will continue to work. My best friend did say she noticed a difference so that's good! Shipped quickly."
4043,"The real thing_I'm always a little reluctant to buy lotions on amazon . The tanning salon will tell me that you will get fake watered down products and others say the salon just says that so they can't sell lotions for 3X the amont I just bought lumanray for $41 at the salon they are selling it for 120!! When I received my lotion it was completely sealed I bought fromALL AMERICAN TAN . I compared my bottle to a package in the salon the color , texture .And smell is exact.  I used the packets at the salon before deciding what lotion to buy and luminary got me super dark my legs don't tan as fast as my upper body and this lotion gives me a even tan which I love . Luminary is a good but."
200,"I like this a little better than SebaMed_The liquid soap at the office is so drying, so I started bringing my own.  While my moisturizing soap keeps my hands from being as dry, they are still in need of lasting moisture.  Now, instead of being so dry they hurt, they're just uncomfortable dry.  I have been spending tons of money for hand creams that are supposed to be lasting, thick and creamy but so far they have all fallen short.  Lately, even the SebaMed which for me moisturizes much better than everything I have tried prior, isn't emoillent enough so I have to keep reapplying between hand washings.  It does make my hands super soft though being 5.5 PH.So far, I like this Aveeno creamy moisturizing oil a little better than the aforementioned product.  I use it exclusively as a hand lotion.  It has a soft, neutral scent and moisturizes without feeling greasy.  I still have to apply it between hand washings but a little less often.  Lately I've been using them together (I start with Aveeno and end with SebaMed).  So far, this has been my best and longest lasting solution.  Maybe I'll experiment by adding quick absorbing, natural oil into it to see if that helps.I bought my Aveeno Creamy Moisturizing Oil at the local drugstore for too much.  Amazon lists it for about 40% less so I'm ordering one for the house through Amazon.  I'm going to fill some travel sized bottles I have on hand so that I can keep some in my purse."
3978,"Quality & Affordable Brush_I like this brush because it does not shed a lot and it was in my budget. I'm not a make-up artist, but I do enjoy applying it to my face, so for me to spend $40 on a brush was out of the question. This brush works well with my creations-LOL!"
2077,always use it_This is the only product I can and will use. It is great for blackheads and helps with oily skin.
7835,"Very pretty but..._This wig is every bit as gorgeous as the picture shows, but it is just a teeny bit thin.  Maybe another weft would have filled it out enough.  I had some clip in extensions that I sewed in and it's perfect.  Overall, a great product at a great price."
1149,Finally a new shade for the pale people in the world_I am VERY fair. In every cosmetic line I am usually the lightest shade. I was so excited when I saw benefit finally made a lighter shade of some-kind-of-gorgeous. The original shade made me look orange. There really is no such thing as one shade fits all. If your fair I would recommend this over the original color. This product does give a sheer tint of coverage to even out your skin tone. Its a cream to powder finish. It truly lasts all day and is light weight. It should be set with a powder after it is applied. If it isn't I noticed it does have a tendency to rub off.I have heard this product's color described for use only on red heads because they tend to be so fair but I am a brunette with fair skin and it works just fine for me. I hate any orangey-ness in make up and this product has none of that like the original shade does.Awesome product! Great color. Wish they made this shade in the travel size!
9363,"Great Product, Really Works!_My hair has always been one of my most favorite features, but with constant heat and hair dyes, I sometimes need help to restore moisture. I have tried so many products in the past to help make my hair healthier, but most of the products tend to leave me and my wallet disappointed. So, when I was offered the chance to try out UNi 100% Organic Pure Moroccan Argan Oil in exchange for my honest review, I didn't hesitate.Ordering my UNi 100% Organic Pure Moroccan Argan Oil was a breeze and shipping was fulfilled via Amazon Prime, so it arrived quite fast. UNi 100% Organic Pure Moroccan Argan Oil comes uniquely in a glass bottle and is dispensed with a dropper. Applying the Moroccan Oil to my hair, I could almost immediately feel a difference. Unlike moisturizers I have used in the past, UNi 100% Organic Pure Moroccan Argan Oil did not leave my hair greasy or oily. Also, unlike some hair products, it did not leave my hair smelling too strongly, in fact, it comes fragrance free, so you can still use all your favorite hair products.My skin is not that dry, but since UNi 100% Pure Moroccan Argan Oil promises to be for ALL skin types, I decided to try some on my 2 week old's dry skin. For two weeks, my husband and I had been trying all the baby skin products to help heal my daughters dry skin and nothing worked. So, when I used the Argan Oil on her little feet, I was shocked at the vast difference in dry skin!I would highly recommend UNi 100% Pure Moroccan Argan Oil, to anyone and everyone! If your hair has been dry, or you have issues with frizz, this is the product for you!Find out more at -[...]Buy UNi 100% Organic Pure Moroccan Argan Oil on Amazon at: http://www.amazon.com/Organic-Moroccan-TRIPLE-ABSORBING-Certified/dp/B00G5WO2VK/"
8568,"RUN DON'T WALK_BUY THIS NOW!!  I mean right now, buy it.  It is AMAZING.  You will be a convert the day you try it.  Absolutely fantastic conditioner.  I will never waste money on Nexxus products again.  L'Oreal Total Repair 5 Conditioner is the nicest, most effective conditioner ever.  My hair is dramatically softer, shinier, silkier and smoother when I use it."
228,Must-have_I don't know what I would do without this stuff; it is a must-have for wardrobe malfunctions. I pop out of way less garments now that I have this.
3087,"Yep, I love it!_I bought this along with a French Manicure nail polish set. It's taken a bit of practice, but I can now give myself a professional looking, inexpensive French Manicure."
6492,"This Will Be My Summer Wash_I have super-sensitive skin which frequently breaks out when exposed to oils and perfumes and anything even mildly harsh really.  This is aggravated during the winter when the cold winds and dry air chaps my skin.So I was fairly apprehensive about trying this product, but I really like the Wash Gel and Toner that Simple puts out.  The Wash Gel I found to be very gentle, and basically unscented. And while the description says that you should create a small amount of lather, the way I've been using it, it has never lathered.  It has though removed all signs of makeup.  And it's left my face feeling cool and refreshed.  Really.  I'm not sure what's in the wash but my face felt cool.That said, it did dry my face a tiny bit.  Now during the summer I would have no problem at all with this.  A tiny bit of drying would, in fact, be a nice feature.  But this winter (and at my age) I don't want any drying, so I'm sticking toNoxzemauntil after the humidity levels rise again.I do recommend this.  It is very gentle and pleasant."
7665,"Absolutely amazing product.  Love it_This does what it says it does.  I've used it as a base coat, added color then used it again as a top coat.  It worked perfectly and my manicure lasted several days without chipping.  I also used it by itself  and it leaves a beautiful, mild glossy finish on natural nails while making them strong and secure against breakage.  I would recomment this product with 100% confidence."
5500,"Infinitipro_Wow this is hot.  Dries your hair in no time.  Nice feature with the swivel handle, to make packing it easier, for on the go people.  I like it.  Review by Yolanda."
3355,"Very sweet, delicate fragrance for daytime_I really like this perfume. To me, it smells like a much more toned-town (daytime) version of Benefit's Something About Sofia, and that is my favorite scent of all time! Fancy smells very fresh, clean, and kind of floral."
681,"Great Scent - Small Bottle_This is costly for such a small tiny bottle. Go to the mall kiosk. Great scent high price, I was really disappointed. But if you look around on amazon I've noticed better deals recently."
2209,"voted #1 for good reason_After reading tons of reviews on what top coat is the best out there, I decided to give this one a go. It works wonders and the insanely fast dry time is no lie. I have 9 month old and sometimes nap time just isn't as long as needed for a quick polish. So with a swipe of this after giving my fingers a new look they are safe from bumps and smudges after about 10 minutes. Though the &#34;no chip&#34; claim that all top coats boast, once again proved false. After one day at work (cashier) I had 3 nails show chips after a 9 hr shift. Still a wonderful product and I will never use a &#34;normal&#34; top coat again."
9298,"The best serum I've tried yet!_Age: 57Skin type: slightly sensitive with slight rosaceaTEN STARS! This serum is A-Maz-Zing! I have tried numerous serum products, and while I have really liked a few of them, this one beats them all.First the packaging: it comes in a nice-looking bottle with a stylistic sketch of a woman on the front, but the best feature is the pump action. My other serum, that I did love but Vidi I like even better (better feel, better  results, better ingredients), comes in a jar, so that I have to dip a bit out - not as hygienic even though I do wash my hands well before using. As well, the pump gives you just enough -- you don't need much, just a nice gentle push on the applicator and that is enough for my entire face-- I do have a small peahead, so - laugh  - still, you won't need a lot.Then there is the texture. When I saw what it looked like - sort of a thin gel - I thought, &#34;Oh, well, guess that'll feel gel-like on my face.&#34; No! As soon as I used my fingertips to smooth it over my skin, it was like silk! SILK, y'all! I have never had a serum so silky feeling! It immediately soaks into your skin, but that silky feel lingers - I wanted to rub this over my entire body, oh that I could buy a vat of this and do just that!The results: I haven't been using it long enough to see how it will do on any fine lines, but, I already see a difference in how my skin looks -- there is a &#34;glow&#34; about it, and though I know it must be too soon, I still feel as if my face looks smoother. Perhaps it's doing something wonderful even as I write this *smile*The ingredients: made in the USA, and I was happy to see that not only is it a &#34;serum&#34; but one that has  Antioxidants, 2 Hydroxy acids, and Multi-Peptides (Glycolic and Salicylic Acids) -- however, I do not have any stinging or irritation on my sensitive skin. And no break-outs. Yes, even at my age, some products still will break me out. Not this one. In fact, after it is absorbed into my skin, I forget I have it on - it just does it's thang while I sleep, or go about  my business. I want to use it just at night to make it last longer, but I love it so much, I use it twice a day: morning, night.I am so impressed with this product that I will be purchasing it when this bottle runs out, and as well, I want to look at what else Vidi has to offer.Try it, y'all, you will not be disappointed - this is a wonderful serum. I just can't say enough good about it."
2229,"Makes my hair super shiny!_Love this stuff - I use it in conjunction with my curling wand to make my hair super shiny and fabulous.  This stuff is great because it won't make your hair look oily even if you use a lot.  Makes my hair appear smooth and frizz-free!Minus one star because I have to use more than the recommended amount.  I have a lot of color-treated hair, so that may be the issue.  But it sure is shiny!"
9961,"Frizz tamer_I use this as a hair serum for frizz control, and it helps so much in taming it. I have natural hair with multiple curl patterns and textures, and I recommend this."
9831,"Really nice all purpose serum_I have been using this to heal my knees and elbows from a very harsh winter. It's working great. I think this would be worth exploring for stretch mark prevention (too late for me, lol) but since it's made from all natural organic ingredients, it's worth looking into.This bottle should last a long time - a little oil goes along way."
9516,"I Love It._I have fine, straight hair, and this conditioner leaves it soft and silky without weighing it down at all. The scent is divine. It smells quite strong while you're using it in the shower, which made me concerned that it would leave my hair smelling perfumed. I'm pleased to report that the scent rinses out almost completely, leaving only a faint, wonderful fragrance when my hair is dry. It's probably not even strong enough for anyone else to smell on my hair, but I love it whenever I get a little whiff of it.I have no idea if the ingredients are as &#34;natural&#34; as the product name implies, but I'm not all that concerned about it. I alternate among a variety of hair products, some all natural and some not, so I figure I've got a good balance.I haven't yet had a chance to try the shampoo that goes with this, but I highly recommend the conditioner, especially if you have fine hair and want it to stay light and bouncy."
3296,"Not convinced this works._I have long, thick, wavy hair that's prone to frizziness.  I battle the frizziness every day with thorough blow-drying and various anti-frizz products.  I'm pretty happy with the products I currently use:Garnier Fructis Leave-In Conditioning Cream Color Shield 10.2 oz., Garnier Fructis Haircare Weightless Leave-In Anti-Frizz Serum, Sleek & Shine 5.1 fl oz (150 ml), andGarnier Frcts Styl-Brllnt Shn Crm Wx - 2oz.  Yes, I do believe that all of these products actually work, because if I omit even one, I can tell a difference.  But I'm always up for trying something new (and hopefully better.)  I've been wanting to try Moroccan Oil, but hesitated because of the price.  So when I found this Agadir Oil on Amazon, I wanted to give it a shot.  Instead, I found that my cheaper drugstore priducts do a better job for a fraction of the price.On a positive note, it does smell nice, so I will continue to use it along with my other products, but I won't purchase it again."
3806,"Pretty good_Never used anything like these before.  Bought them to keep my hair out of my face while I wash it.I took one star away because I can't decide whether I want them to be more constrictive or wider in order to better hold the hair at bay.  I am Caucasian with Asian/Hispanic hair and it's not really all that wild but once it gets caught in my face-cleaning machine it ALL comes out.  I wanted this so that I wouldn't have to continually touch my hair while cleaning my face and no matter how completely I get it all originally covered, some of it comes creeping back out.  Does the elastic wear out right away?  Maybe I'm doing it wrong."
9141,Great Mascara!_I love this mascara! It makes my lashes look big and full. I like how this mascara has a brush for your upper lashes and then one for your lower lashes. I will definitely be buying this mascara again!
9152,"Very Soothing_Bath Path Mineral Sea Salt Soak / B00DCNBST4I'm a big fan of bath salts, so I was happy to receive a free review copy of this product from the manufacturer. I take baths almost nightly, and that tends to dry out my skin; I have to be careful what oils or additives I add to the water because my skin is very sensitive to artificial scents and perfumes.These bath salts have a pleasing subtle scent of lavender (not so much, to me, to be overwhelming, though mileage will vary on these things) and are great for moisturizing dry skin. I've used these every night for a couple of weeks now and have had no adverse reaction to the bath salts and I do feel like my legs and feet are softer as a result. I will definitely be buying more of these when this batch runs out.NOTE: This review is based on a free review copy of this product.~ Ana Mardoll"
4845,Terrible Texture - runny and separated_I have several Gelish polishes and have never had trouble like I did with this one.  The color is so thin that it runs off the nail right after you apply it.  It also is separated and has a lot of yellow to it.  I suspect I got a really old bottle and am really disappointed.  13 bucks down the drain since it is just going in the trash.  If you order I would recommend NOT ordering from Beauty Shine as their stock may be really dated.  Otherwise I love Gelish products!
5740,"I love it_I've been a fan of Real Technique brushes for a while now, and decided didn't hesitate in purchasing this Shading Bush. WOW - I wasn't disappointed. This brush is amazing quality and is so soft! It applies my eyeshadow so effortlessly, and I tend to use this more to soften the edges of my eyeshadow to give a more seamless look. It's very easy to clean and maintains it's shape which has been a real problem for me with other brushes purchased in the past. This brush dries quickly too - I leave this to air dry and it's good to use again within 1-2 hours. Excellent buy - I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this brush to others and the complete Real Techniques range."
9456,"Amazing !!_I thought it was fake because of its low cost . Products like these at such a low cost are usually not working .I have tried everything skin rollers , massages but none was actually working .But to my surprise this is the only product which helped me !Value for moneyThanks"
2590,"Me likey :)._I'm always a big fan of heated lash curlers. I have owned several Brands in years. I am Asian with poker straight hard to curl lashes. Heated lash curler works best for my lashes. Paired with waterproof mascara to hold the curl all day. I like the design of this curler it has 2 silicon pads. And the protective cover is very nice. The only thing I don't like is that I have to hold the ON switch for it to warm up. With the Talika & Forever Free heated curlers, it locks the power button in place when its heating & I apply the rest of my makeup while it's heating up. Fresh batteries works great. I normally replace every 2 weeks. Anything the emits heat uses more elect. I normally stock up on AAA batteries that I buy in bulk from Sam's Club just for this purpose."
6166,"Tons of storage and different interior pattern than pictured_These cases are huge. I use the large one for all the supplies for gel manicure. My LED lamp, all colors (about 20 bottles) and prep materials fit in the case.  They could probably fit in the small case but I'm using that one for makeup.I ordered the black and white Damask with hot pink trim. The photo online shows the case with a tan feather pattern on the interior.  I was pleasantly surprised when I opened my case and it was lined with plain pink lining that matches the trim of the bag.  For me, this was a bonus but wanted to make sure future buyers are aware of what they are getting."
1208,"OMIGOSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  IT WORKS FABULOUSLY_I have been so annoyed with my old blow dryer, that I had started washing and air drying my hair. Last Sunday I finally decided that i needed to stop walking around with bad hair, and get a new blow dryer. I did not know where or how to find a good one, so I went on Consumer Report website and found that this dryer was highly rated.I came on Amazon's website, and after looking at the reviews, I felt comfortable enough to purchase this, and it arrived on Wednesday. I washed my hair this evening and am extremely pleased with my new dryer. It was neither too loud nor too hot, and it dried my thick course hair very quickly, and my hair is soft and beautiful like I've never seen it unless done by my salon.I figured my hair would look good, but I honestly wasn't expecting this result.  I'm already looking forward to washing my hair.Great product and I'm extremely happy."
3414,"No effect_I was sooo excited for this product! I thought I finally might be able to wake up feeling like a real person. i wish I had great results to report, but the product did absolutely nothing for me.  I even tried it during the day, hoping it would give me a little extra energy...nope ;(.  And I do not understand why there are only 40 tablets! If recommended to take 2, then this is only a 20 day supply, and that stinks!!  Very inconvenient that a bottle doesn't last for a month"
488,Adorable Color!_I love Essie polishes and this one is now one of my favorites! Its adorable and stays on forever. Gorgeous color.
7840,Don't waste your money_These are so hard you can't get them to fit.  It's a waste of money. Threw them in trash.  Terrible.
2220,"Ok soap, didn't totally clear my skin_When I used this soap on my face, my skin felt squeaky clean and tight. On my body, it cleared some of my skin, but not all. When I got a rash from an allergic reaction to my new cat, this soap cleared it up in a few days. I would definitely recommend this soap to someone else. It has a mild, soapy scent. It does leave brown residue where ever you leave it in the shower. It also lathers up a little brown at first. I wouldn't recommend you use it on a white sponge or a washcloth."
6616,"Nice consistency, a little goes a looong way_This is an amazing product. I like how it glides into your skin and make you seem flawless. It gives light to medium coverage with just a small amount of application.  The reason it is receiving 4 starts is because of its light tint. I believe it will not be appropriate for everyone, good only for women with light medium skin tones or even ivory. You can blend it with a favorite tinted moisturizer to get the desired hue. Overall, it is a fantastic product with a very reasonable price!"
9750,"Azure Naturals ULTIMATE VITAMIN C Skin Repair Serum_What a awesome product A+++ works great I like the Azure Naturals ULTIMATE VITAMIN C Skin Repair Serum is the Fastest Working Best Vitamin C Serum For Your Face Containing 20% Vitamin C + 11% Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E + Organic Aloe + Amino Complex + Organic Jojoba Oil + Ferulic Acid, Top Natural Vitamin C Anti Aging Anti Wrinkle Facial Skin Care Serum Available, Deeply Penetrates Skin to Help Repair Sun Damage, Gradually Fades Age Spots, Reduces Fine Lines & Wrinkles,  I would recommend this for everyone.  I truly love this company they are awesome if you have any questions they always answer the questions always fast replies. Excellent company A++++"
9500,"A very nice scent_My husband has been using this product for some time now and we both liked the original scent as well as the clean rinsing performance in this no hassle one product shampoo and conditioned.  I though I would try out this new scent, though and see if it was as good as the older one.  Mmmmmm.  It's even better.  Very light yet manly in a clean, almost citrusy way.  It doesn't over power or hang around in the air.  The shampoo leaves his hair - and beard and mustaches - clean and soft with nice body and no unpleasant odor or taste (when kissing his beard LOL). I will buy this Alpine Fresh variety again.  Good work, Suave, you got it just right."
52,"Menthol_I remember trying this a year and a half ago. Essentially, it made my face red and burn, and small bumps appear near my jaw. This is most likely because it is a cream-based cleanser and it contains menthol, which is not recommended for sensitive skin (granted, I sometimes use Vick's Vapo Rub on the very rare cystic blemish, but it is always on a small space)."
5786,"This worked for us forty-somethings to smooth out fine lines :) wrinkles are noticeably improved, but some results can be subtle_&#2951; Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Recommended with warm fuzzies! But the pump container needs to be replaced with a simple squeeze tube!!Living in this dry mountain air, I always welcome any kind of moisturizing skin care, especially since I love being outside in the great outdoors and playing up in the mountains both during winter and summer.  And if the moisturizer also smooths out wrinkles, that is an added bonus!  Several of us, all in our forties, first started using this last autumn, and we all give it a thumbs-up.  This does help to smooth out fine lines, especially around the eye area and forehead region, and when used twice a day, our skin felt smoother and tighter.  Larger wrinkles and crow's feet will not totally disappear, but they do become less noticeable over time with regular usage of this lotion.  This lotion has a nice creamy feel and smell to it.  Although everyone's skin sensitivities and allergies may differ, none of our 'test panel' of users experienced any allergic reactions, rashes, or itchiness from using this product.But I am removing one whole star rating because the pump dispenser is really annoying to use when a simple squeeze tube would have been both easier to use and also more compact to carry.  Sometimes, the pump may even clog so no lotion can be pumped out.  In that case, you have to pry up the entire pump mechanism; the pump comes apart fairly easily after a bit of prying.  With the pumped now removed, you can just dip a finger into the tub to get lotion out.  The red cap and black pump can then be snapped back onto the tub.  But if you are unable to clear the clog on the pump, then you need to pry off the pump again when you use the lotion later.  When the container became empty and would no longer pump out more lotion, I pried off the pump part and found that there was still some lotion left inside the tub that could have been extracted if it was dispensed from a more flexible squeeze tube.  Since this lotion is not cheap, I would want every drop of lotion that I paid for.  So Olay should have packaged this lotion in a simple squeeze tube."
9169,Don't work well_These don't stay in my hair well at all. Not what I expected and will find something else the next time.
1639,Can't be without it!_The smell is amazing.  Keeps my hair tame and manageble!  I have used this for years and still love it.
5435,"squeaky clean skin_For years I've been Adovia's loose sea salt as a facial scrub (it's great for stressed out, sensitive skin), but the last batch was clumpy and a little oily and smelled &#34;off&#34; so I decided it was time to shop around. I've used SF Salt Company food salts and they are great, so I decided to give the Dead Sea Salts for face/body a try.These salts are WONDERFUL. They are clean, snow-white, fresh, and the grain is perfect- not so fine that they dissolve instantly, but not large enough that they scrape your skin off. And the bag is quite large- much larger than the jars I have been purchasing. It's resealable, so I just poured some of the salt into a little plastic container and keep that in the shower. I store the rest under the cabinet, so it stays fresh.My skin feels so fresh and *clean* after using these salts. I simply mix a little with my facial cleanser, and then scrub it into my skin. The salt exfoliates and then dissolves completely, and it makes my skin smooth and squeaky clean without stripping it like harsh chemical cleaners can. It also prevents breakouts and gets rid of any dry spots.Sea Salt is great for the skin, and Dead Sea Salt seems to be the best. Forget about the other brands and the pre-made scrubs, just buy a bag of these and you'll be set for great skin for a long time. I'm so happy!"
367,Good color_This is a great color for a smoky eye that is not 'too much.' Totally appropriate to wear to work every day.
888,Nice Lather and Scent_The Dove Color Care shampoo is formulated with lower sulfate which is supposed to be gentler on color hair. It has a nice lather and I felt like it did a good job of getting my hair clean. It has a really nice scent and left my hair smelling good.The bottle is a nice size and fits in the shower nicely. I really like the line and will be using again.
1020,"Best hair dryer I've had_This is a powerful dryer, but it doesn't singe my hair the way most do.  I'm used to a smaller dryer, so the heft took a little getting used to, but my small ones never felt like a salon dryer the way this one does.  My one caveat is if you have a specific storage space, be sure to pay attention to the measurements.  I didn't, but I lucked out.  It stays in a drawer in my vanity that has an electrical outlet built in, and it fits in there with no room to spare.  If it's even lying on a hairpin or its own cord, the drawer won't shut. So, I'm glad I bought it, and I expect we'll have a long and beautiful relationship."
4647,fabulous for travel!_Perfect size for travel and powerful enough to dry hair just like full size dryer.  I took it to Europe.  The dual voltage capability worked without a hitch; love it.
5373,I LOVE these plates!!_After buying so many nail polishes I wanted to get something that would help me create cute designs to complete my manicure. I purchased stickers but didn't do any justice and would peel off easily. So I decided to give this a try. I purchased these plates including the Shany Stamping Nail Art set which is separate. Once they came in I was thrilled to try it. The plates have a wide variety of designs which can be used for different occasions! So awesome! No more spending money at the nail salon for a complete manicure! Kudos Shany Cosmetics!
2401,"Simple and small hair donut._I ordered three of these because of the job I recently got requires hair up at all times. Since I love looking cute and I didn't want to be stuck to plain old pony tails, I thought buns would be a simple way to spice up my routine.I ordered these and they came in a different package than pictured. (I will upload a few pictures so you can see the package and the bun size.) They are very small, about the size of my hand, and they are exactly what I wanted. I have normal, shoulder blade length hair and it was very simple to use.How I used it was I put my hair up in a pony tail, put my hair through the hole of the hair donut, spread my hair evenly across the donut, use another hair tie to keep those hairs in place, then finally I used a few bobby pins to wrap the remaining hair around the base on the bun. There are many ways to use these, but that's how I made my simple ballerina looking bun."
9252,amazing deal_They took awhile to receive but as expected with how cheap they are. Worth the wait I love them!  Perfect for nail art.
1550,"Does nothing_This hair serum does nothing for my hair. It's just like putting Crisco on my hair. It's the same texture as Crisco oil and since I am not cooking, it was a waste of money. I have relaxed hair and perhaps it's not for my type of hair."
328,"Many Uses_Brought this for my hearing aid molds, but also learned it is good for nail care and those nasty little ridges you get in your nails....who knew!!!  Will def buy more."
7681,"What a good find!_I love these. Some evenings after a long day at work and school, I get home late and am too exhausted to spend all kinds of time removing makeup. Makeup removal is a snap using these towelettes. And these particular towelettes have a very pleasant scent.I highly recommend these."
7880,Skip this one_This hair clip is very light weight. It's not at all what I expected. I wouldn't recommend this one.
1180,"Perfect!_These blend so nicely!  I really was skeptical but now that I have used them and compared them to others, I really can't imagine using anything else."
9756,"spots be gone!_I was given this product to test out for free from Influenster and I am so happy I was selected.  I have spots on my chin from acne that are dark and need corrected so this product was perfect for me.  The scent and consistency is great.  It smells nice and a little bit of the product goes a long way.  It rubs into the skin very softly and smoothly.  The only thing I did not like about the product was that I think it made my skin greasier throughout the day than normal.  Since then I have decided to only use in areas with dark spots rather than apply to my whole face.  So, currently I am using just on my chin and still have noticed it is making my chin more oily, however, still a great product that I will continue to use."
9947,"My eyes feel great_I have terrible dark under eye circles that I have due to genetics and bad sleeping habits. I have tried this and I have nothing but positive thoughts about it. It smells amazing...like fresh cucumbers. The pump at the top makes it easy to distribute onto my fingers for easy application. The gel is clearish, light and springy. I have been using this product for over a week now and I can safely say that my undereye darkness has diminished quite a bit. It will always be there in some form but it's not as bad as it used to be. I also like how this product was not tested on animals."
2798,"Wonderful_The only face wash I have used since it was made available. I have used Olay products for 20 years, beats big store brands, and home &#34;agent&#34; products. I can replenish when I want and not have to contact a dealer. Love this wash,micro beads yet gentle on my close to 60 year old face. Delivered to my door."
5844,"I think it works just as well as the name brand._I've used both the name brand and the Equate brand.  I really don't see any difference.  I lost a lot of hair due to thyroid/hormone issues.  I have seen doctors and take medications to correct the problem.  But my hair did not grow back!  I had actual bald spots and thought I would have a lifetime of hats and/or wigs. I saw a dermatologist that specializes in women's issues, including hair loss.  He told me the most cost effective route would be to try 2% minoxidil first and if it did not work we would go further.  I experienced visible results in less than a month!  Now, a year later, my hair has completely grown in and is stronger and fuller than before. I've always had baby-fine, thin hair and I still do. But  my hair is fuller, thicker and stronger (and longer!) than it was in my 20's (I'm now 52).  Worth a try?  Absolutely."
9455,"Silky smooth and glowing_Compared to Jergen's Lighter Skin BB cream, the darker tone doesn't really have a big difference in color which is great as I can use either shades for my skin. It works pretty good - I have been using a smaller tube yet more expensive BB cream for months. The Jergens BB cream is much bigger a 7.5 ounce, very economical and works almost as good if not better. If you use it only for the face it will lasts a long time (yet it is labeled to be used for your whole body as well). It feels silky smooth and dries up fast once you apply it. Works good as moisturizer and I sense no feeling of dry skin when wearing it . The slight tint helps to hide some of the skin imperfections and gives you a glowing complexion."
4407,"My favorite lipliner_I've never been disappointed with the lip liner, it has good staying power with lipstick and always looks nice. Not dry like other liners."
8900,I'm in love with the blender!_It works really well with bare minerals powder foundation. I am currently using ben nye powder but i find it kinda off with this powder. I'm still working with it. I love how light and beautiful it feels on my skin. I may mist the ben nye powder before applying to the face. But this thing is better than any damn brush ive used.
7411,"awesome_Highly pigmented, great color selection and for the price you can't beat it. Overall I love sleek products, great alternative if u don't want to spend too much on the name brand stuff."
9996,Great!_Awesome!!! I am loving this. I've been searching for products that have better ingredients in them as my skin is super sensitive. The formulation in this is great and it definitely brightens the skin.
2305,LOVE IT!_I absolutely love this train case! It has so much room! I have ALOT of make up and it fit perfectly! Perfect price too!
6956,"Good for the money_Good UV lmap for the money.  This product is above average, it works great for $30!  The only thing i don't like about this lamp is that you have to do your nails one hand at a time so it takes a while.  Other than that, this is a great product."
9810,"Hair and Nails feel great_I have dry and brittle nails and hair that breaks easily, I have been using this for about a week and I truly feel like my nails are stronger and not as brittle and I feel like my hair is silkier and healthier and stronger and breaking less. Smells amazing and makes me want to put it on morning and night, but don't want my hair too greasy, since I am prone to that. Great Product for sure!"
6481,Great face wipes_These are my favorite face wipes. My esthetician recommended them and they do not make me break out (which I tend to have a problem with) sometimes if it's tricky getting your eye makeup off- wet the cloth a little more and that usually helps.
4737,"Amazing brush! Not so amazing arrival :,1384646400_Love this brush, however when I received it, the metal was dented and the brush was poorly packaged. I contacted Sigma, as E-tailz was a trusted reseller, and she replaced my brush for me no questions asked.I use this with Makeup Forever HD Foundation and it goes on really well, no shedding at all!Make absolutely sure you purchase this from an official retailer (Sigma has a list on their website), because if it arrives damaged Sigma will fix the problem."
4226,Love it!_I figured what could I lose for something so cheap.  This stuff works all day long.  My make-up didn't smear or crease.
3862,"Love it seriously_Bling in black label lip stick .... I cant wear lip stick , usually or gloss or even chap stick it leaves a weird feeling on my lips and I have to wipe it off ... this  back label has the best color pay off it shows up beautifully I can wear it with out wiping it off and it looks prettier then any lip product I've ever owned"
1685,these things saved my hair!_No more flat ironing or hot curling for fast bangs and bumps/waves in my hair. A-MAZ-ING! You can sleep in them for really tight curls or just for a short while for amazing bangs and waves. Sleep? No problem. These bendy twisty wutchumacallits are so comfortable to rest your head on. And they stay put. you can tie them down if you want to or just do what ever you want- they stay in until you take them out. Glad I bought 5 packs right off and will buy more sizes!  LOVE LOVE LOVE TLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE WUTCHUMACALLITS THINGIES.
737,"I use this as a bed warmer_I love this little blow dryer.  I use it to warm up my bed when it is cold at night.  (before I go to sleep)  I dont use it to blow dry my hair so I dont know about how it would work for that, but it works great for my purposes."
831,Good Cologne_Great cologne for working ...I lasts all day and the projection is excellent. I get so much compliments on it.
1369,great product_I like to use this when stamping. I apply it OVER the base color and never have problems with the image sticking to the stamper.
2868,"A good, solid night cream but too expensive_Wow. The price keeps jumping up on this. I got it for little over $16 using subscribe and save a mere three weeks ago. I have been using this product but alternating with yes to carrots night cream. I do like the Naturally Ageless. It has a nice smell that doesn't overpower or linger and the cream is very emollient and it stays on the face a little heavier than yes to carrots. I am not sure what effect it is having on my skin other than keeping it soft and supple. I don't see a big difference in lines around my eyes, but then again, I don't use it every day. I really don't think that this cream will make a big difference in fine lines, but it will keep skin from drying out. In the winter, that is especially important and I make sure to apply some sort of night cream every night."
6524,Great brush set_This is a great brush set. I haven't experienced any shedding and the brushes are keeping their shape. Theres a brush for everything!
939,"Easy as all that!_This is one of the simpliest, fastest, most compact roller set I've ever used.  It is limited to 5 large & 5 medium ionic rollers; easy to set, easy to heat, easy to remove.  Results are soft, non-frizzy, wavy hair that keeps all day.  I used almost daily with great results.  Its tiny footprint allows this set to go easily on travel."
5346,"I don't like this powder_After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to give this powder a try since it is so reasonably priced.  I like the packaging and the amount of product is generous, but the powder is too light and makes me look pale.  I also notice white spots if I don't rub it into my skin.  What's odd is that the description says &#34;masks fine lines&#34; and mine look more prominent after applying this powder, especially my frown lines.  I really wanted this to work, so I continued to use it for 2 weeks, but it's not for me. Fortunately, it didn't cost too much."
9186,"Definitely doesn't live up to the hype!_Don't waste your money on this! I have a makeup channel on youtube (hapamanda) and I have tried and tested so many mascaras. This one is not good. The only way this would work is if you have naturally long beautiful lashes already. This mascara is very wet, so it weighs down the lashes making it impossible to hold a curl. I say to stick to drug store mascaras and splurge on other cosmetic items like foundation, concealer or eyeshadow palettes. This just isn't worth the money. The only good thing is that it's a travel size so I didn't have to waste my money on the full size ($21+). Try the Covergirl Clump Crushers or the Maybelline Bombshell Macara instead."
9052,doesn't do a thing_Natural wrinkle cream?  well I don't see any difference at all.....so maybe it just didn't work on me....I will keep looking for a cream that does what it says...
8535,Even Men will like this Shampoo_As a long time shopper at Amazon I have always valued the comments in choosing products.In my 70s with lots of hair but thinner.  Decided to let is grow long and use a better shampoo than the typical Sams or Costco brands.Tresemme is very popular......and now with me.  First difference is how little gives so much foamy lather.  Second while shampooing my hair feels slicker and smooth.  Using this shampoo and the equivalent conditioner my hair looks and feels smoother and more body and cleaner(?).
972,"I Totally {Heart} Olay Regenerist 2-Step Microdermabrasion & Peel Kit! (Plus A Helpful Tip)_The fact of the matter is that over the counter home spa products do not and cannot compare to professional med-spa services or treatments, however, as far as home spa products go, Olay Regenerist 2-Step Microdermabrasion & Peel Kit is freakin' awesome!The only thing better than this product is a medical grade medical-microdermabrasion treatment (awesome) performed by a medical dermatologist.I promise you, after a few months, your skin will glow! For best results, use it on the face every 2 weeks (to allow for cellular repair and to avoid over-use), and on the entire body once each month-- and it is a totally great way for saving money on pricey spa facials, (but if you are looking to actually shrink pores and/or minimize acne scarring you will need to have a real Medical-Microdermabrasion treatment or Laser Genesis treatment).The only downside to this product is the skimpy size available, (and that is only because I use it on the body as well as the face so I use a lot more), but still, for the results, it IS definitely worth it and a bargain at the price...Overall Grade: A- or 4.75-Stars!"
7944,Love it_Love the color. The formula was very good too. With that price expected a little less but this is just like the one I usually buy from Target.
4669,"Great Cleanser!_Leaves my face so soft and clean, it's almost like I really don't need a moisturizer after cleansing.  I highly recommend to anyone with mature skin to clean withot drying."
9407,"Simply Polishes and Smooths_This item does it job as a smoother and polisher but has a manly fragrance. I'd prefer dull frizzies than have manly smelling hair. Bed head, day-old head are OK but man-head is not for me. I prefer to smell like sugar and spice and everything nice!"
9596,"I like it a LOT_I like the light scent and I use it instead of water to &#34;reset&#34; my curly hair, it gives it a much better feel and way less frizz than using plain water. Sometimes I'll use a little water and then finish up with the Tresemme, either way, much better results than plain water. I like it a lot and will probably buy it when I run out of my trial bottle. I did not give it 5 stars because I'm not over the moon gaga about it, but it's definitely worth 4 stars as a great product."
2836,"Love all red cherry lashes_I wear the #747s, #43, & wispies depending on my mood and makeup. All three look fantastic and are easy to apply.The #747s are great for when I wear glasses or for a more natural look. As with all Red Cherry lashes, easy to clean and can last for many uses if cared for/stored correctly. Totally worth the money!!!"
6900,"For Clean and Fresh Hair_This shampoo has a silky, rather than a creamy texture.  It has a scent that dissipates fairly quickly and leaves the hair feeling and looking clean and fresh.  I found it to be a totally acceptable product."
3273,"Awesome_Vidal sasson always has reliable products. these bobby pins are flexible enough to put in easy, and they come out with minimal pulling, yet they stay put! I will never buy another brand of bobby pin!"
1999,Great product!!!_This definitely is a must have even if you don't wear makeup that often. Clean any makeup in a few minutes. I can tell there is no harmful ingredients used in this product cause my eyes are very sensitive but feels nothing but fresh after everytime I use it. Highly recommend!!!
7062,"burts bees super shiny shampoo_Great for gray hair. Super shiny, healthy, manageable. Doesn't get much better than this!  Such a great find and such a great price!"
3802,"great oil for hair_would recommend for anyone, great smell price, and was packaged right this time. get it if you like taking care of you  hair."
9722,too drying_4 out of 4 family members who used this caress product found it dried out the skin. We have skin that ranges from oily to dry and yet everyone was itching so I had to toss it.
85,"LOVE_I have been trying to find a toner that isn't as harsh on the skin. Came upon this one and gave it a try. Must say its the best toner I have gotten. Smells wonderful not a harsh chemical nasty smell, smells floral but clean. Leaves my face beautiful rarely have to put lotion on after and thats rare for my dry skin. Skin is smoother and I feel like its more even. A must have!"
2495,"Keratase Lait Vital_I don't have great hair, however, this conditioner makes my hair soft & controllable.  It has a nice scent.  It doesn't pay to buy the small bottle, because it's pricey.  I bought the large one and it's about 1/2 the price"
4974,Amazing value for such an awesome long lasting cologne_This bottle is huge and will last you forever.. This is my day to day cologne and it is strong enough to let people know you smell good without bugging them.
4512,"One word... WOW!_It looks as if I'm wearing red sparkles over a dark red (nearly black) polish. This effect really makes it stand out! I cannot stop staring at my nails in the light! But whenever I'm indoors it looks like just a dark red polish. I personally love how its a &#34;sleeper&#34; nail polish, but of course if it's made by Nubar it has to stand out!"
9341,"My first time using a natural shampoo and I chose the correct product!!_This product is simply amazing! I have just begun my journey in using naturally made products and this hair product is setting my standards high! I am pleasantly surprised that my hair can look so smooth and silky with all natural ingredients. It makes sense I guess... No more harsh chemicals to strip my hair of all that is it meant to be... Natural. My hair is long, quite thin ... And I only need to use about the size of a dime. You really need to work the shampoo through the hair. It was a little different to barely have a lather... But I would rather this happen than have to deal with a chemically infested product. I am so grateful I came across this shampoo when I was searching for naturally made shampoos.The customer service is also incredible. This product is highly recommended!!"
4286,"Definitely NOT a wash out conditioner, but I love it!_I've been using this product for months (I have short, fine, natural african american hair). I spied it at the store and the fact that it is supposed to be all natural seemed great.Initially, the first day I used it I HATED the smell. Imagine a person who has used way too much perfume. I used it again though and over time got used to the smell.My hair is thicker and growing much more in my opinion. I use this when I am styling my hair (twists) or when I just need to moisturize it. I recommend squirting it into your hand and rubbing it around first so it's not just a big white glob.I never wash this out when I use it. I use it like a daily moisturizer and my hair feels great. It's still dry (which is the nature of most people's natural black hair), but it's growing and getting better!"
6828,Good Inexpensive Alternative to Popular Handheld Facial Cleanser_I used this product paired with a creamy cleanser and received a great exfoliation. I would suggest using a light touch because the bristles on the brush can be a bit scratchy and could irritate the skin. The attachments (a brush for exfoliation and a sponge for moisturizing) were very easy to attach and remove. I was quite happy with the end result and will add this to my skincare routine.
2814,"Great Lotion For Eczema_I get really bad winter dryness on my legs, which prompts eczema if left untreated.  Using this two-three times a day makes it so I never have to worry.  It's also good after shaving.It's a little liquidy, but it's super moisturizing and absorbs quickly into my skin.  The fragrance is very light and just smells like lotion.Recommend this to everyone as a daily moisturizer, and I continue to buy it when I run out."
4231,"Good Buy_Seriously, these blushes are awesome! Cannot say enough good things. Price is incredible for quality. I love nars and laura mercier blushes and never thought something so cheap could compare, but elf blushes do. Totally worth a try considering price!"
6470,An answer for sensitive skin_This product has quickly become a product I don't want to be without.  I at age 45 was breaking out. This cleanser calmed my sensitive skin. It provides a gentle but thorough wash removing all the make-up and grime without drying out your skin. I highly recommend it.
7467,"Scalp and Hair Conditioner_When I first tried this balm, I did apply too much and when I washed it out there was no greasy or waxy feel.Now that I've been using it to moisten my dry ends after each shampoo, I can tell that thee is a reduction in split ends and the brittleness of my processed hair.It has a lovely soft fresh scent and it helps increase shine.Just remember less is more with this balm.Since I experiment with hair colors from time to time, this jar is definitely handy to have on the shelf."
6308,Great for my hair_My hair's thick & course and needs all the conditioning it can get. This stuff works great! It really moisturizes my hair well. My hair's much softer than before. But still hard to comb through when dry. This stuff is great.. but it's not magic.
6552,Amazing Brush_I love this Brush..blends under eye concealer flawlessly..very soft and dense bristles.A must have in girl makeup kit..I love it.
8920,"Great product solid coverage under eyes, creamy, no creasing or running, nice stay put color, nice to use for other blemishes on_Solid under eye concealer, creamy, does not results in creases, long lasting, nice to use on other blemishes as well.Nice product thank you."
909,"Didn't Do Anything_I've been a fan of Organic Root Stimulator's products for years now. I live by their Creamy Olive Oil Shampoo, Olive Oil Replenishing Conditioner, and Hair Mayonnaise.So after going natural for the past couple of months I looked for Organic Root Stimulator's products that specializes in natural African American hair care. When I discovered their line, I purchased the Scalp Scrub, Hair Serum, Uplifting Shampoo, Hair Mayonnaise, Shea Butter Softener, and Hair Fertilizer. Combined the products were more than $50.I used the Hair Serum frequently as directed on my edges because I wanted to grow them back. After about a month, I noticed no change in my edge growth. For $13 I would like to think that this product would work, but I feel ripped off!Another thing I'm not fond of is the liquid-y substance. After applying on my edges, it tends to drip down my face causing my pores to clog.As an avid fan of Organic Root Stimulator's products, I'm highly disappointed in this one. It doesn't work and I felt that I've wasted my money and my time."
7348,"Useless_The round end is way too big to pop anything on my face. Ultimately, all it does is push against my face and leaves a dark circle around the area from trying to push so damn hard to get it to do its job! The wire circle is also very thin, which pushes into the skin even more & doesn't create any pressure (just pushes). In the garbage"
9377,"Biore Self Heating One Minute Mask, 4 Count_I really, really like this mask... Except the price. $8/week? OUCH!I'll have to agree with everyone on the first try, though... It really felt like my face was oily and gross and I didn't want to do it again. So, I begrudgingly tried it a second time and this time my face felt GREAT! I learned that if I goop it on in three locations (one on each cheek and one on the forehead) and THEN spread it around after it's all out of the package that I can get a virtual delayed reaction. Sooooo warm! &#60;3Then after about a minute I hop in the shower and wash it all off (ain't nobody got time for the sink!!). The feeling is so refreshing and light and I feel like there's nothing left on my face afterwords.I just can't get over the price... Wow that's a bit much for a product they want you using 3-4 times per week! I decided that this may be a good once a week ordeal to pamper myself after a long work week or just before.But, hey, if you can swing that cost, it's worth it."
3731,"Does not burn or feel greasy, even when you sweat!_Incredible!  I'm a young, fashion forward person who works outside in the sun, and sweats while working.  I don't want to wrinkle or get skincancer, and I've tried a number of 'sensitive skin' products.  None work like Elta MD.  I needed a sunscreen that doesn't burn when your pores open up from the heat.  It's light, it doesn't feel oily at all, and it doesn't burn.HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended.  I am now a loyal customer of this brand, and I have purchased this product multiple times."
924,Good Product_How can something that is supposed to be so good for your body smell so foul. this product works but i just need to get over the smell.
4759,nice brushes_Got this set for Christmas.  It works well with my mineral makeup.  I have brushes from other makeup but I wanted smaller brushes that fit the makeup I am currently using.  I recommend them to anyone who likes mineral makeup.
6001,eyelashes ._i did a 4 star on these for the reason . i dont like the bigger ones you can really tell thay are fake not like them at all . but the thiner ones are great i have used 1 out of them 2 times and i thank i can get 1 more out of them and if i clean the glue off i thank i can get more but thay are just enuff for every day i love them . so for what you pay you get your money out of the one set .
7591,"It is good for a drugstore gel eyeliner_I was originally using MAC fluid liner, but I noticed after three months that the formula wasn't very good. It was separating and it clumped a lot. So I wanted to try a cheaper version and I went with Loreal since I couldn't get the Maybelline version. I have to admit that I am impressed. I wasn't expecting the formula to be as smooth or for it to last eight hours even without some type of eye shadow primer. I have had it for about four months and I know you are supposed to change them out every three to six months, but the eye liner hasn't started to separate or become dry. I am overall happy with this product and would probably purchase it again."
7553,love it_l really like them they are so small and when l clip the clips there very flate lol l can tell l will be having fun this summer time.
7420,Great_My favorite hair product for right now. Been stocking up on this product. Great product for a very reasonable price.
890,"I like it_This shampoo left my hair so silky and smooth (I used it with the matching conditioner as recommended).  It smells clean and fresh, but isn't overpowering.  It lathers well and rinses off cleanly and easily.  I blow dried my hair after using this and it still left me smooth, shiny, and silky."
569,"Simple Breakdown_Alright. So many reviews on the product here's my simple breakdown of it.Don't follow the instructions. They are for the majority I believe a pile of lies hahaHoweverThis conditioner is the bomb. Now, I don't trust my hair enough to use it solely as a shampoo because I have dandruff and stuff like that and just know that won't work, that is not what this stuff treats so I use it only as a conditioner.Take the time to figure out the amount of pumps needed for your hair. There is never a one size fits all scenario which I think is how this is treated. I recommend start with 10 to leave in your hair for a while (while you shave and wash up other places while you shower.) Then rinse it out of course. This 40-60 pumps nonsense would weigh my hair down so much I can't imagine so just take the time to figure out how much you actually need.I was actually hoping this product would bomb simply because it is expensive and I didn't want to love it too much but unfortunately... I do... my hair feels so amazing. I don't dye my hair much or anything but I had lately because of the one time I dyed my hair it was a mistake after a mistake haha Anyway, My hair feels even better before I ever dyed it and I have to say, I absolutely recommend trying this product if you are able to spare the expense."
7554,"great!_i'm trying different nail tips, and these are great, I am very pleased, you will not be disappointed if purchased,i don't remember where they came from, but they came pretty quick to me here in GA."
2509,"Waste of money_This was a complete waste of money, first off the bottles were SOOOOO small. Second I didn't see any peeling!!!!! I bought it for my body and tough to lighten area's. Let me say I saw nothing, I would not recommend this to anyone especially for those of you with tough skin or hard to lighten area's."
2238,"Safe and Effective._I love this shampoo!  I have tried every natural shampoo my local natural foods store has to offer and this is the best by leaps and bounds. It cleans without the dreaded clumpy, matted feeling of other natural shampoos. I would recommend any of the John Masters Conditioners as well.  It is unrealistic to expect to get a truly natural, nontoxic product for the same price as cheap drugstore products. Traditional drugstore products are cheap because the ingredients are cheap. You do have to put out a little more money for better ingredients. There are many brands that cost about the same but do not have the same excellent ingredients list or effects of the Jon Masters Organics. This shampoo as an EWG toxicity rating of 2."
9636,"Pretty face! (and hair, skin, nails, etc.)_*Apologies in advance for the long review!*I normally use organic extra virgin coconut oil and Watts brand retinol + hyaluaronic acid on my face, but adding this argan oil to my regimen has totally boosted the results, and therefore, changed my skin. The results were almost immediate, seriously!I'm still only 33 years old, but because I slather my face with these oils at night, I look better than I did when I was 23. My fine wrinkles are faded and gone, and my pores are shrinking- which I didn't think could ever be possible for me. I have a super oily T-zone, and using a few drops of argan oil as a day moisturizer (and under makeup) has regulated my spastic sebum. The stubborn blackheads on my nose and forehead are GONE, which is a complete shocker. I've had crappy skin since childhood. I got my first zit in kindergarten! Using the argan in the day, and argan+organic virgin coconut oil at night may seem like a high maintence chore to keep up with, but it's really not, and it's beyond worth it. If doing so can change my once-haggard skin, it can work for anyone. :) Oh, and it also gives you stupidly gorgeous hair, and helps eliminate dandruff. This stuff rules. And if you're on the fence because of cost, seriously, don't worry. It's a multi-purpose oil and a little goes a looong way.Also, real quick, I just wanted to add that this seller was incredibly courteous, and the quality/quantity/price of the product is excellent (believe me, I shopped around to a ridiculous extent); Foxbrim is now my go-to argan oil brand!"
92,"Excellent Face Cream_I have tried numerous face creams, moisturizers but Jason's product is excellent. It provides long lasting moisture to my skin, smells great, and I see a difference as far as minimizing fine lines  This is a subscribe and save product for me."
2217,"Best top coat ever!_This is the best top coat ever! It makes your nail polish dry faster, last longer, and gives your nail a coating of strength to prevent breakage. I understand some people are worried about the ingredients in this product, and the smell is quite potent. I highly suggest not using this top coat during pregancy or around kids."
1595,"I will die if they ever stop making this!!!!!!!!!!!!_I have written Aveeno praising them for creating such a fine product!I have numerous autoimmune conditions and am allergic to everything.  My skin breaks out to most soaps (even ones that are for sensitive skin and perfume free.)  BUT, not to this product.  The 'Ultra Calming' is the only line I have ever found that my skin can tolerate and doesn't dry out my face, like acne cleansers.While I am left with some acne scars on my face from years of using and trying the wrong products, I'd like to say BRAVO to Aveeno for making this one.  I am having regular microdermabrasion treatments to help revive the skin that the other cleansers ruined and left scarred.  Aveeno, please notify me if this line is ever going to be discontinued so I can rent a warehouse and stock it full of this stuff to last the rest of my life.  I cannot live without it!  Only took me 15 years to find the right face products."
7784,"BEST FACIAL CLEANSER I'VE TRIED TO DATE!_As with many things, I decided to Google  what I was looking for and when I input &#34;best moisturizing facial cleanser&#34;, this product was one that came up in top 10 reviews. After reading the reviews on Amazon, i decided to give it a try. i received it today and was first impressed with the smell. i was expecting it to be unpleasant as some &#34;all natural&#34; products are, but this wasn't the case. i didn't notice a sage smell either, it was a refreshing slight lemon smell, but nothing overpowering. i have sensitive skin and this did not irritate my skin either. it was very creamy, went on very easily and removed all of my makeup. my skin gets very dry in the winter so i was looking for a moisturizing cleanser and this left my face feeling soft, smooth and clean without feeling greasy. i fell in love right away and just had to leave a review! This is a product that i would put on subscribe and save if available. Because of the quality of this product, i am going to check out their facial moisturizers.  i was using the Olay Thermal Mini-Peel Scrub, but this is 10 times better. Although this does not exfoliate, it seems to leave my skin glowing and feeling so much better. i will keep the olay for a once a week exfoliator instead of using every night as i was. Now i am on a mission for the perfect moisturizer for dry skin that will work for under eyes as well as the rest of my face that doesn't cost a fortune! i just purchased organic jojoba oil and use that for under my eyes as well as for split ends, dry hands/feet/ but i want a real facial moisturizer."
261,Dark_The color is okay..Its alot darker in person then in the photo..Still pretty i guess but i prefer brighter colors..It comes out really nice though..Shipping was awesome(:
9639,Kinda dark_This is a great glitter polish with many colors in it.  It does have some black glitter in it which is a little darker than I desired but I do like it.
9414,Excellent Oil for your skin!!_I really like the quality of this Jojoba oil. It is appropriately in a dark glass bottle. The dropper is very convenient for dropping a little oil on you hand to apply on your skin. It leaves my skin feeling soft as silk. The company was concerned and emailed me right away to ask me if I had received the product and asked how I liked it. They did several follow up emails with me.  I will be ordering my Jojoba oil from them from now on.
4520,"Exactly as expected_A friend has used this travel bag for years and I always admired it.  I finally took the plunge and purchased from for myself prior to a recent vacation.  I was very happy I did.  This holds so much yet rolls up and safely protects so much.  Easy to pack, unpack and use.  Each pouch attaches with velcro for easy removing or reattachment.  I have used this for several trips in the past year and it still looks like new.  A great gift idea, I Love it!"
6358,"Great Product_The shellac top and base coat were fresh and look great!  Coupled with the UV dryer, I am very satisfied."
4871,"I love it_I have small eyes and cant really work with different colors everytime i buy a pallette i use its colors for nail polish, lipstick, etc... however, with this pallette i dont see any color going to waist I &lt;3 d good quality and the color of this pallette. I recommend this pallette"
4217,Does a good job_I like this product because it adds an extra boost of moister and shine to my hair.  I use it after cleansing my hair and combine it with an oil that I use prior to blow-drying and it works great.
9452,"Nice sheer formula_i normally use Miracle Skin Transformer for body so I have some experience with BB creams specifically targeted for the rest of the body as well as the face. This is a nice, sheer formula, but I was a little surprised that it didn't provide a bit more coverage. I was also surprised that it was as light as it is. When they say darker skin tone, they're only talking about olive skin as opposed to very dark skin. I don't think it would be obvious on darker complexions - there were no clear demarcation lines after it was applied, but if you've got even just a bit of a tan, I think this is the formula you'd want.There is some fragrance in it, but it's a mild. pleasant scent and didn't seem to cause any irritation. It left my skin soft and moisturized without being greasy and it did even my skin tone a bit, though I used more than I expected to need to minimize  discolorations on my arms. On my legs, it looked great. I didn't have any smearing or staining problems with it. It's a good product."
1365,"Works well_Does the job in 5 minutes, cannot say anything more about it than that!  One kit will probably last you for at least a month."
6717,Great Product_I love my Mia2! This has helped clear up my skin and I will never use another product! It is strong enough to clean my pores but not too harsh on the skin.
5172,"Not what it says._I bought this thinking it was different than the color protecting conditioner but its not. So when I saw that it was same, I shipped it back."
6328,"Gorgeous red color!_This is a gorgeous rich, but still not deep red color. It is such a perfect color for the holidays as it is a classic holiday ornament shade. One of my favorites!"
7717,"pros and cons_It goes on fairly smooth, different than regular liquid eyeliner pens I've used though. It doesn't fell thick and cakey. I don't even fell it there. That's a big pro. Con, due to its difference in application it took me a minute to figure it out. You're supposed to close your eye and just glide it sideways along the lashline."
1170,"It is a fake!_I am editing my review because I just saw the case and had not tested the item yet. It is not the original. I still have one original one with me and it is way softer, it absorbs water differently and it shrinks back. This one stayed practically the same size. I am really upset :("
1263,"Pro dryer made a huge difference_Some things, you got to buy higher quality. We live and learn which items are worth spending on to get good quality. I am usually cynical of expensive products that promise but don't deliver I wish I knew that pro dryers made such a difference. I waited until my 30s to try a pro dryer and wow, what a difference. I have short, fine hair that needs volume but is also dry and brittle. I also am busy and impatient so I need a hair routine that's quick and effective. I don't know if it's the ions or the heat level or what but this dryer helps my hair get bouncy and shiny in little time. I love it! I did not rate it 5 because it's quite heavy but it's a solid 4.5 stars. I recommend anyone who can afford to get a hair dryer to bite the bullet and get a good machine. It is worth it!"
7291,"So far so good_I ordered this item thru the Amazon Vine program because I have a small on-going issue with dandruff.  Having only used it for the past three days I cannot say it will definitively take care of that problem, but I must say the combination of anti-dandruff and conditioner formulas seems to be quite effective so far.  A small amount lathers up quite well, the scent is minor and not intrusive and the shampoo rinses out easily and thoroughly.  And there is noticeably less dandruff on my shoulders.  Recommended."
9949,"Thanks Insta Natural - Loving My Youthful Glow!!_You can use this eye cream with or without other Insta Natural products, but I highly recommend their moisturizer as well as their Emu Oil - the emu oil is great for your hair and pairing the moisturizer along with the eye cream for dark circles ensures your face will be looking brighter and years younger! My husband is 5 years younger than me, and no one would guess it. I use my Insta Natural products twice daily and they feel amazing on my skin and also help ensure a youthful glow! We have an 8 month old, so I don't get a great night sleep and the eye cream lessens the dark circles and smooths out the wrinkles. Thanks Insta Natural Eye Cream!!!"
6852,It works on long hair!_This works on long hair. I purchased another and it did not work on waist length hair. This works! It's easy to use and I believe will last provided you use this on dry hair. I recommend this for long haired ppl who haven't been able to achieve the perfect bun with other products. Slip your hair through the middle and start rolling at your ends. It hold as well (I slept in my bun and it was there in the morning)!
9259,"Beautiful colors_I absolutely love these mini nail polishes. The colors are beautiful. I actually kept the pinks and gave the others as a gift (they come in an individual box of 5), the person receiving these loved them also. I've painted my nails a couple of times and still have more to use. It help me decide to get the bigger bottle for the colors I absolutely loved. The glitter is perfect, I wish I could post pictures as I have the nail polish on with the glitter and it looks really pretty. You can't go wrong with these mini bottles. They arrived quickly too."
5281,"Great cotton rounds_I love that these feature two different textures on each side: one soft, the other with a texture for when you want a deeper clean. The one downside I've found to these is that the layer that's textured sometimes peels off and separates. I'm happy to say that these don't shred, so overall I'm happy with the quality."
928,"Love it_It leaves your hair feeling smooth and tames your hair. I have try other products that have not work so good on my hair,  leaved it greasy and flat."
2094,"The missing piece for my home manicure_To save some money, I've been doing my nails at home.  The thing I miss most about a professional manicure is the state of my cuticles.  I've tried trimming, pushing, grooming with other products, but my cuticles were still out of control.  This product is used at most salons, so I thought I'd give it a try.  BINGO! It is what I was missing for professional results at home.  Just rub on and leave for about a minute. Push back the cuticles with an orange stick or, better yet, a cuticle pushing too.  I was amazed at the lose skin that came off, leaving a much cleaner base and smoother edge when I applied polish.  Minimal nipping with the cuticle trimmer was necessary to remove hang nails.  Another great CND product!"
1665,"One Condition_Love this product.  Seems to not weigh my hair down when I leave it in.  Smells great, keeps hair hydrated."
9239,"Use It With The Famous Literine/Vinegar Soak_These foot files work well to get rid of dry, itchy, unattractive skin patches.  They work even better if you use them in conjunction with the famous vinegar, Listerine warm water, foot soak.  They are currently offered by Amazon at a very fair price.  I was provided a free sample from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review."
356,YAY!!!_I had surgery and tried pellet therapy with side affects. So after six moths I started this product and it's awesome. I will continue this because it WORKS and it is at the best price on Amazon.
8447,Clear Deep Nourishing Treatment Mask_Lately I've been having some issues with my scalp being dry and this stuff is really amazing. It feels really good when I put it on and has a very pleasant smell. My scalp feels really moisturized after I use and no itching at all. My hair also looks and feels great after use. Love this stuff!
6122,"can't complain_well this item arrived sooner than I was expecting and they were packed very well, none of the rhinestones were out of place. not sure if there were exactly 2400 pieces but it looked full enough for me. very happy"
5230,Great concealor_Loved this color and it lasted forever.  I just ordered it again about a year later.  Very blendable as advertised.
3411,"Pleasantly Surprising_I had never used any Vaseline products beyond their Petroleum Jelly, before trying this body lotion. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this lotion is, having been a Lubriderm user for many years. This lotion has a light fragrance that is slightly floral, but fades away rather quickly. The effects of the lotion itself, however, do not fade away quickly. The lotion comes out of the bottle at an average consistency, though the pump on this bottle dispenses slightly more lotion per full pump than I expected. The lotion smoothes on realatively easily, and it doesn't take a lot of rubbing to work it into the skin. After application, the lotion leaves the skin with a soft, radiant glow that manages to give my skin a very healthy look, especially in sunlight. Vaseline hit a homerun with how this product makes my skin feel as well. After applying it, my skin feels very silky, not greasy, not sticky, but silky, almost like running your fingers over a soft wax, would be the best way I can think to describe it. This lotion still leaves my skin looking amazingly radiant and silky feeling for a good 12 hours after application before I notice it's effects starting to fade away.One thing I'd like to note, is I suffer from moderate t severe Dyshidrotic Eczema on my hands and feet, and many skin care products, even moisturizing lotions tend to cause a lot of stinging and burning sensation when applied. Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion does not sting, burn or otherwise seem to irritate my skin, which is a huge plus for me. Compared to the Lubriderm with Shea and Cocoa Butters I have used regularly for the past several years, this Vaseline body lotion is better feeling, longer lasting, and produces more noticeable results. I'll be sticking with the Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion from here on out."
3431,"This product had great reviews, and i had to try..I LOVE IT_I get tons of compliments on whenever I use this.  Use gloves while putting it on, and it's not like being in a self-tanner with the big sprays on you..It does come out in a stream-like and you DO need to rub it in.  Take note, once it's applied, let dry and don't shower for 4-6 hours.  It is worth it, and lasts for 5-10 days.  Keep moisturized and don't use mineral oil moisturizer."
8767,"Good shampoo_I like the Motions Straight Finish Cleanser.  It suds good without much effort.  It cut through any grime and product residue that you might have without making your hair feel stripped.  I have a problem with shampoos drying my hair, but this did a good job.  I did use it with the Motions leave in conditioner and sealer. All together they worked well and I would say that they are worth a try."
3803,"Gives great shine_This oil treatment gives my hair shine but a little greasy look . But when I use a blow dryer it looks natural. I noticed that my hair stopped falling after using Argan treatment , that's why I took a chance on this product . You only need a very small amount to apply on your hair , which saves you a lot of money."
4020,"Great product!_This is sooo awesome! I have cracked heels in winter & it feels so good on them.  It is a bit messy getting off the wax so put something underneath you.  Just like the other reviews said, the wax that comes with it is gross. I followed their instructions & bought the Therabath Refill Paraffin Wax in Lavender. OMG!!! It smells so good.  I recommend this product & AGAIN as others have said the lavender wax!"
9498,"From the Mrs..._When I opened the package, I was surprised to see that the oil was in a lovely glass bottle with a spray top. This design probably keeps the oil from oxidizing too quickly, and keeping it fresh longer. I only needed very little oil to spread it evenly throughout my hair. The oil had a pleasant fragrance and was not greasy at all. It actually felt light-weight, even evaporating somewhat. When I followed the instructions to apply from the middle to the ends of the hair, my hair had great body and bounce after a blow-dry with a boar's hair brush. However, I had to gauge how much to use by trial and error since I used a little too much at first and possibly used it too close to my roots, so my hair was flatter than I wanted when I woke up (I wash and dry my hair at night). I guess if I wanted my hair on the sleeker side, then it came out perfectly. I usually use my blow-dryer and curling iron daily, so I did feel like the oil was protecting my hair from heat damage, while giving it a nice shine. My hair definitely looks healthier when I use it, having great touchability and scent, and added body to my hair style. I would recommend this oil for daily or every other day use."
3971,"Very Soft and Doesn't Shed_I have used this brush for every thing, from applying liquid foundation and powders to blush and bronzer and each application is flawless and looks better than any makeup brush I've used"
4181,"It's great!_I like it a lot. No clumps, no mess, and my lashes look like I got falsies on. Would buy more."
1278,"Awesome detangler_My hairdresser used this on my super tangled hair and got the tangles out so fast and painless it blew my mind. I had to get it for myself, so happy I did."
3715,Really removes all the makeup_It is a very good product! Removed all my makeup and felt nice on my skin. Thank you! Good price too! I already told my cousins and my aunt to try it.
3962,"OK I guess..._The lotion worked but...I didn't go three shades darker in one session. Also, the ATO is terrible especially if you sweat a lot during tanning."
2282,"Best Lotion for Dry, Sensitive Skin_This is the best lotion for dry, sensitive skin. I've tried every single lotion available in a drugstore and they are all either not moisturizing, oily, or make me itch. This is super moisturizing, sinks in quite fast, not the least bit oily, and never irritates my skin."
6440,waste of money!_The stamper and plates are a joke - the imprints are bad and doesn't give a clean image. I only use it once. I can't even give this away!
663,Jury still out._Bought this as good reviews. I think I like treseme better but still use this on occasion. The spray can is nice as you can put it where you want it!
7151,"Mom loves it_I wrote a review for the conditioner.  I ordered this for my Mom who is 63 and starting to go gray.  The shampoo and conditioner make her hair silky and shiny.  She has tried some other brands but I told her how much I love the Pantene Highlighting Expressions for blondes and she agreed to try it.  She loves this stuff.  I can't find it at a brick and mortar store, so this is now on my wish list for when Mom needs more."
5187,"One of the Best Conditioners I've Ever Used!!!_Great hydrating conditioner! My hair had previously been thinned and damaged by cheap shampoos and conditioners. I had to cut off some of the damage, but this conditioner helped save the rest of my hair. My hair immediately felt softer and looked shinier after one use. I only have two complaints: 1) Its a very thick conditioner so its kinda hard to get out of the bottle, 2) I have coarse hair and it didn't really help with detangling :( But I will continue to buy this product. The price is well worth it!"
2694,No scent!_I have always disliked the scent of Vaseline Intesive Care lotion so when I saw this was an unscented version I thought I'd try it.  I am very pleased to find that this lotion is totally unscented!  It's very effective at improving the look and feel of my nearly-sixty year old skin.  The pump bottle is convenient and works nice and smooth.
9842,"Excellent day cream!_I've been using EMFACEiZE every day for a couple of weeks now.  It's not a miracle cream, but it is a very high quality daily moisturizer with some unique qualities.My experience:EMFACiZE is scent-free.It's absorbed quickly into skin.A little dab'll do ya!  It doesn't take much.The list of ingredients leans towards the natural.  There are jojoba and avocado oils; pomegranate has a presence, and the rest of the ingredients have pronounceable names.Though skin feels tight after application, the cream does not dry. The tightness takes a bit of getting used to, but it is visible which does make one look a bit younger.The consistency is not mayonnaise-y; this cream is much lighter, which makes it good for under makeup.There is no SPF protection, so you'll either need a sunscreen in addition, or your makeup should have an SPF rating.I have cosmetic-sensitive skin and lots of skin treatments cause nasty little subdermal bumps.  I've been using this product for two weeks and have yet to experience a reaction.  It's safe around eyes and mouth.  Yay!I'm a big fan of Korean BBs.  The EMFACEiZE is an excellent base for BBs--it keeps the BB from drying out skin and settling into wrinkles.  In addition, there's some ingredient in the EmFACEize that catches the light and makes skin look better than it actually is.EMFACEiZE is very good value for the money.  It compares favorably with other creams I've used at many different price points like Clinique, Dr. Perricone (the gold standard), and Olay products.Since I've only been using the product for two weeks, I can't address long-range benefits, but the short term benefits make this product well worth the purchase.  While I was given a sample for review, I would not hesitate to purchase it."
7034,"Part of my personal skincare routine_I gotta say I've used this soap not only for my face but whole body, especially because I live with a lot of people and they often use up the body soap before I get a chance to.I use this as part of my one of my two daily cleanings, either in the morning or at night to wash my face and I love the smell! It makes my face feel nice, soft and cleans out any of the makeup/nightcream I use.If you're overly sensitive to smells, you may not like it. It has a soft smell but it bothered my parents for example. I love it personally.It's definitely a go: affordable, healthy ingredients,gentle for most skin types...I have rosecea."
9134,"Not for breakout-prone skin..._Although the package didn't state 'not non-comedogenic'  I decided to try it.  (BB creams can be SO expensive!)Bad move on my part.  I used it twice, and began seeing breakouts.  I wasn't very happy with the product-- coverage did not seem to help the skins appearance.  The medium shade did work well with my skin tone.Not recommended for sensitive or otherwise breakout prone skin.  I wanted to like this product, but just won't work for me."
6100,Variety_Great variety. I love to see the looks on my clients face after I pull these babies out. They're like wow look at all the colors lol
76,"Great product_I love the L'Oreal Visible lift makeup, it goes on smooth, lasts throughout the day, and has a very light weight feel on the skin. I think it's actually making my complexion better. It was a great price and free shipping from this seller. I would definitely recommend to any age group or complexion type."
633,"Terrible_After maybe 30 minutes of using it I was able to get a very, very slight curvy in my eyelashes. I could've gotten better results by using an old metal eyelash curler in 3 minutes for only a few bucks! A total waste of money!"
4459,"gentle, natural and light. my favorite hand cream!_i threw away and returned many creams before I found the right one. this lotion is light but nourishing. leaves my hands soft but not sticky. the fragrance is very light almost smell free. i would recommend it to a queen! beautiful! thank you!"
1797,"Smells good AND......_This stuff smells very good. When I put it on, I don't need anything else. No perfume, nothing. I bought it on a friend's recommendation because I have a lot of raised and visible scarring on my arms. It's taken about 7 months, but I am starting to see a bit of a difference. Not a lot, but just a little. So yes, I love this Bio-oil and will definitely buy it a 3rd time :)"
5083,"Great perfume._Coach's Poppy perfume is awesome! Very young and fresh. Great for teens and preteens, as well as adults! Also has a relatively long lasting time."
3163,"A little sticky_Not sure if it was really plumping, didn't notice any plumping and didn't have the minty/stinging feel. It is fairly sticky though and doesn't last very long."
7463,"Edited Review - made hair fall out after 2 months of use!_Well, I did love how my hair felt using this, however after 2 months of straight usage, I began noticing hair loss. Every day in the shower I could pull dozens of strands from my head, then more. I was concerned enough to make an appointment with my doctor. He could find nothing wrong, and recommended changing hair products. I did change (to Garnier Fructis) and within a week, the hair loss quit. After a few months using Garnier my hair is starting to return to its normal thickness.I do not think this was an allergic reaction as my scalp wasn't involved. I do not have treated or permed hair, and I only blow dry or use a curling iron on it a few times a month. The only thing that could have caused the problem was this shampoo/conditioner.I've left the original review text below._____________________________________________I've always been one of those people who roll their eyes when they see ads for hair products that make actual changes to your hair. I mean, it's dead, how many changes can you make to it?Well, darned if I have to quit the eye rolling routine from now on, because this stuff has changed how my hair looks and feels!I used to have long silky blonde hair. I loved it. Then I turned 40 and this evil gray curly stuff invaded my scalp. Now nearing 50, about half of my hair is still straight and fine, and the rest is grizzled and curly. It is NOT pretty.I did try some different products to tame the evil mass on my head, but nothing really worked, and if it did anything to the curly stuff, it made the straight stuff look like an oily mess, so I had about given up.Fortunately this product was offered to me through Vine, and after 2 weeks of use, I am completely amazed at how different my hair looks and feels. I can't say it's the same as it was when I was young, but the curly stuff is no longer frizzy, and the straight stuff looks good too. I can wear my hair back in a ponytail again without having the sides look like 'crazy cat lady' by afternoon. It is wonderful!I don't know if it will work as well for everyone, but if you've got 'middle-aged hair problems' I definitely recommend giving it a try!"
8044,"Better than Latisse_Let me start of by saying I am a licensed Esthetician and owned a day spa for several years. We carried jan Marini's lash serum when it first came out years ago. It was amazing but very expensive. I then moved on to Latisse. Same thing, work but expensive. Then I decided to give Rapid lash a shot. $30 bucks, can't go wrong. Well I have found that Rapid lash works just as well or even better then the expensive brands. I've been using it for about 2 years now. My lashes are long and full. I double take in the mirror sometimes cause it looks like I have my lash extensions that I use to wear on. People need to understand that our lashes have a cycle just life the hair on our heads. Eyelashes fall out and new ones grow. I stopped using anything on my eye lashes awhile ago because they had gotten so long, then what happens is after about a month you lose lashes and if not using a lash growth serum of course they will grow back short. Once I started using RL again, it takes about 4 weeks and you will start seeing those long lashes again. This product works!"
5888,"a touch of glowiness_iam pale with a pinky undertone and i always find it difficult to find the right (touch) to my make up that makes glowy and enhance my undertone. well, this stuff is just the right touch to my everyday or evening make up. it's so smoothly blended and gives u the glowy pinkiness every girl is looking for. so pleased and happy~"
4324,Does not clump_Love this mascara because it's subtle and does not clump.  I don't look like a scary doll with too much mascara.  I also like the brown color as it's hard to find in stores and I have blondish hair so I don't want black mascara.
8630,"Lives up to the hype_Nexxus Hydralight completely lives up to its name and promise of being weightless while smelling amazing. I have blonde, superfine hair that tends to be greasy after being washed with most 'mainstream' shampoos like Pantene and Dove. But even using way too much of this shampoo because the bottle was full, my hair still has volume and lift without looking greasy at all. I'm a very satisfied customer!"
1947,"I was confused at first, but love it!_I was confused at first because I thought the mask would be ready to put straight on your face, but instead you have to mix it with water or apple vinegar (I did both) The instructions said 50 - 50 for the mixing and it's right, I ended up making a huge batch since I put too much liquid thinking it would thicken up. I did love this mask! It didn't make my skin feel too tight but after I took it off I could feel a big difference. My skin felt clean and actually looked healthier. It reminds me of that expensive dead sea mineral stuff everyone use to use, but a lot cheaper and you get a bigger quantity.I would suggest this to anyone looking for a good face mask!"
3557,"Not as great as other SHANY sets, but good_For the price, these deserve five stars. Compared to high end brushes, they'd be three stars. I wouldn't give these as a gift, because they shed a lot, especially the larger brushes. But I would easily recommend buying this set to anyone, even those who have really expensive brushes in their collection. Buy this set for the variety of eye makeup brushes. I use the larger brushes for bronzer (since it can go on everywhere and doesn't tend to be over pigmented on skin like blush). In other words, I use the large brushes when applying something that doesn't require a lot of definition. I also use them for translucent powder, but hesitate to use them for any powders that can cake, as the brushes may apply too thick in some areas and less coverage in others. The smaller angled brushes are great for creating a natural but defined look with eyebrow powder. Honestly, I use these every day, despite the shedding and often over my more expensive brushes. Well worth the price."
8041,"Great_Found mixed reviews for this. I painted the actual nail & have no problems so far. The item shipped rather quickly which was great. I actually need to order more soon. I also plan on getting those rings you use for index cards, to better organize my swatch collection."
2947,Great Deal!_Make up brushes are usually super expensive so I tend to avoid even purchasing whole sets. This set is awesome! The variations of brushes and the foldable cloth container they come in make it perfect for travel in a small carry on. They take up the same amount of space as a flip flop pretty much. Great quality and they arrived in a timely manner.
112,"Face scrubber stopped working_The sauna works fine with distilled water, its open enough to not suffocate you with steam but you can put a towel on if your looking to get deep into the pores. The facial scrubber cleaned out my blackheads. But only after a month it stopped working, its not meant to get wet at all, even the humidity of the bathroom will ruin it."
7292,"Clear Men is a better alternative to H&S - great smell and feel on the scalp - no need for separate conditioner either_I have recently had the opportunity to try all 5 of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy varieties.  I had all 5 bottles lines up in my shower, but of course, I couldn't try them all at once because some of the performance is based on cleaning ability, feel of hair afterwards, and lingering smell.  So over the course of a week, I tried each shampoo to rate them.  Meanwhile, my bottles ofHead & Shoulders Classic Clean 2 in 1 Dandruff Shampoo & Conditioner with pump 33.8 Fluid ounce,Neutrogena Therapeutic Shampoo, Original Formula, 16 Fluid Ounce (473 ml), andHead & Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care with Eucalyptus Dandruff Shampoo 14.2 Fluid ounce (Pack of 2)watched in fear.All of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy feature Pyrithione Zinc, the same active ingredient as the classic Head and Shoulders.  It is an effective medicine for controlling dandruff.  Clear Men brings the advertised 'bio nutrium 10', a self-proclaimed blend that includes ginseng, tea tree, and mint.The shampoo color is white (not blue like H&S;), and is a little bit more runny.  However, on applying it to my hair I found it was thick and felt almost like conditioner.  It is not sudsy at all but does cover the hair very well.  This formulation advertises it is 'Dry Scalp Hydration'.  It does not have a strong cooling/burning feel like theCLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Cool Sport Mint, 12.9 Fluid Ounce, and does not smell as strong asCLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong & Full, 12.9 Fluid Ounce.  It has a light aroma of tea-tree oil and mint and is a great every-day shampoo.The shampoo rinsed out clean and it seems to do a good job controlling dandruff.  There was no real lasting smell or feel to it.  I didn't need a separate conditioner because this particular shampoo is a 2-in-1.  As I rinsed it out, my hair brushed and controlled easily without the need for conditioner as well.I like the Clear Men's line and would say that this particular one is one of my favorites.  To be frank, I tried all 3 of the 2-in-1 shampoos and had a real problem telling any difference between them.  They are all recommended, or get whichever one is the cheapest at the time."
1088,"Love it!_Covers spider veins and has excellent coverage.  Does not get on clothes if you allow to dry.  It is a bit of a mess to put on though but otherwise, would not face summer without a case of this!"
2084,"love_I love badger balm and all of them, I have several and enjoy putting them on and relaxing. They are very helpful"
5015,"Very good shampoo_Other than having a great deal of loss of the product in transit and complaining to the seller, the remainder I have decided to keep using and then purchase again from another seller. It's a good product and ones hair does feel really soft with it. I am happy with this shampoo and hope the ingredients only improve if the manufacturers are thinking of changing ingredients."
9534,"Worked fine_I love a product with natural ingredients, including healthy seaweed (yes, it's healthy!). This conditioner doesn't have parabens, as the current TV spot for it stresses, and I imagine that's a good thing though I don't know much about parabens. What I experienced with it the several times I've used it is that it has a pleasant smell and white, slightly runny texture, it made my hair easy to comb through after the shower, and it left it soft throughout the day. I tried it according the directions, leaving it in a few minutes before rinsing, and I tried it with just rinsing right away. I didn't see a real difference between the two methods. And it didn't seem to add volume, but my hair is very fine."
6955,BEST PRICE EVER!_I see these UV lamps in professional beauty suppliers all the time for $150 and up and always rolled my eyes at the possiblity of having an at home kit until I saw this! Its the same wattage as the $150 models for a fraction of the price!! I have used this lamp with Gelish polish with flawless results. The timer is a MUST have! I even raved about it so much that a friend of mine bought one too! It comes with 4 lights and a heavy grit nail file as a bonus.
1303,"Great product_I love this messager, it gives you a really deep clean and I really like the foaming action.  And it gets down into your pores for an awesome clean and makes my face feel fantastic."
3774,Love this!_I was so glad when I first saw this in CVS and read that they use NO animal ingredients and are Vegan to boot! This conditioner and the shampoo leave my hair very soft and silky smooth. Plus getting here on Amazon at this price was a great bonus! I will definitely continue to use this product. Oh and did I mention that the scent is wonderful? Rosemary and mint were a pleasant surprise that keep the hair smelling great all day long!
7852,"Handy little TOILETRY travel bag ~ would recommend!_This 'Davidsbeenhere' hanging travel toiletry bag is great!  I have to say this is definitely a neat little travel bag...the compartments on each side with zippers are a good size and provide easy access.  The middle compartment is very nice, with a zipper and it's handy hanging capability: its a great middle zipper opening for easy access and storage.  Please be a tad careful though when you open the middle compartment as the little metal hanging hook tends to flip up and out - it whacked my finger the first time I unzippered it, LOL. I took this handy little bag with me on a few trips, both local and national travel, and I must say it came in very handy.! The organization pockets are well-organized, neat and beyond the norm found in a toiletry bag: I found this to be a great travelers companion, even for little 'on the go' day trips and weekends: I would definitely recommend this travel bag from David Hoffman!!"
4782,"Lovely hairdryer...just don't use it while you are sleeping!_This hairdryer is more compact then the other one I own and has a lot of options.  It is easy to hold in the hand, though I am not sure why hairdryers have the outside shell they do.  I stored my old one under my sink and the shell became sticky to the point I didn't want to use it. This one seems to have a skin of the same material on the outside.  I will store this in my closet and not in the bathroom where there is too much heat.  I like the fact it is smaller than other hairdryers I have owned, that it comes with several settings like cold and hot air at different speeds and has a cleanable filter, such little extras do add up.  Plus it is a really attractive hairdryer, with its pink metal and almost black-burgundy skin.  The plug has a reset on it too, which is nice. Some hairdryers I've had have not had this option.  It dries my overly thick curly hair very well.  It has an attachment for drying curly hair and also a more typical one for when I want to dry it straighter in order to use my flat iron on my hair once it is dry.  I have very long hair, so this does the trick and this hair dryer is pretty light and easy to use, much more than my previous Conair one.  It is more quiet too.  It's less hassle drying my hair with this than with other dryers I have owned.  The reason this gets a four star rating rather than a five is the shell, which I have to store in my closet or else the heat will make it sticky in a few years and the fact it took me some time to get used to the pearl particles when the dryer is on since it smells a bit odd, like burning rock.The most interesting thing about this dryer was reading the warnings in the box.  One of the warnings says, 'Do Not Use While Sleeping', which I still have to figure out.  Is that even possible?  Sleep hair drying?  One has to wonder what happened in order for the company to put that on their warning list.  It is a nice hairdryer for the money, just don't use it after you go to bed and start sleeping."
747,Nice shine_This product does leave a nice shine on your nail polish.  But if you are always cleaning it will not keep your nail polish from chipping before ten days.  But for the price it is a good product.  I will purchase again.
519,"Worst straightening iron I've used._Though this is only the second straightening iron I've ever used, it is by far worse than my other one.  It didn't dry my hair when I tried to dry it when it was wet.  No matter what setting I used when my hair is dry, I can't get it nearly as straight as my other iron, and it's not very good.  It takes a little over thirty minutes to straighten my slightly curly shoulder length hair with this iron, where it only takes fifteen minutes with my other iron.  I honestly wouldn't recommend this iron to anyone.  I found it to be a definite waste of money."
1911,Great stuff_This is really great for people who have problems with too much acid in their body. I would recommend it for sure.
247,"Don't grap the tip!_IMPORTANT TIP:  Most curling irons have a tip at the end that one can hold onto.  THIS DOESN'T!!  There are gloves one can buy to use with these Marcel types of curling irons so one doesn't burn the tips of the fingers. I'm still getting used to it, because I don't use it every day, but so far, I love the ease and size of this curling iron.  I thing a glove or at least 2 finger cots should be in the package for what it costs, but other than that, no complaints so far."
3624,"Batman cape works great_This cape does a great job protecting me from hair during my haircuts.  Combined with my neck strips, I can now emerge from my stay-at-home haircuts without the itchy feeling I used to get."
7211,"probably better for very curly, thick hair; ok for Latino hair_My hair is more wavy than curly, and fairly thin, so this product doesn't so much define the waves (and calm the frizz) so much as add weight and shine. The weight makes my hair have less volume, which is unfortunate, but the shine looks great, so what I've started doing is adding it to the dry ends and using other products for the rest.Best when wet, you can distribute the thick and sort of greasy cream more evenly without having what look like matted little oil slick spots. The smell isn't too strong, and overall, if used sparingly and in a way that works for your hair type, this is a pretty good product!"
5775,"Perfect!_Absoutely love these brushes! These 3 brushes are really the essentials for makeup. You can use these 3 for eyeshadow, foundation, concealer, and powder&#8230; excellent, universal set!"
4729,The reason for the high price_The reason this one is so high is because its the original Naked Palette. This one sold out so quickly that no one had it in stock anywhere. Then Urban Decay came out with another one and its different from this one with a couple different colors. This one also comes with a duel eyeliner and the newer one comes with a brush. Hope that explain why the cost is so high on this one.
5678,Best face cream at any price_I went to the dermatologist with severely dry hard skin on my face this winter. It was like sandpaper. This product he gave me a sample of cleared up my problem in less than two weeks. I also like the liquid cleanser they sell. I use the am and pm moisturizing lotion formula on my face and a supplement of hyaluronic acid cream on my face. No need for any other high priced cosmetics.
7892,"Picture is deceiving_Yes, I know, you can't always go by the picture of what you are getting. I was a little disappointed in the difference between the fullness of the jars in the picture and the lack thereof in the product upon its arrival."
2078,love kisses_I love this lotion it firms and makes my skin so soft always after a shower dont dry off just put it on and let your skin drinkit up
695,"What a Delight_This one is even better than the one for Women .I was looking for a perfume for my boys and I found it . This one is a keeper for me. It is manly, not overpowering."
6266,Nice leave in conditioner!_I've been trying to find a drugstore spray leave in conditioner that is somewhat similar to Enjoy's and after trying a few others hit on a winner in this one!  You don't have to use a ton of it to get the conditioning effects of this spray.  It is VERY close to matching theirs and it smells great too!
1234,great flat iron_I bought this flat iron to replace my Helen of troy flat iron.  It was recommended by a hair dresser friend and works great. I would def recommend.
2092,"Amazing at removing the dead skin!!!_This Peel removes all the dead skin on your face and will be as effective when you get to the end of the tube as it was when you first opened it. I have graduated in my skin care routine to mostly all prescription strength creams/serums/acids but this is one drugstore MUST HAVE that I will not leave behind. If you use Retin A and have been getting that creepy, scaly, alligator dead skin that just hangs around well then you absolutely need this. This is the one product that removes all of that FAST.. at one time and lets your new younger silkier skin shine through. The key I found is to leave it on for atleast an hour (or longer I have left it on overnight BUT I have very tolerant skin). After you have let your peel set in when you wash your face it will just rinse all of that dead skin right down the sink. Please be careful though and maybe check your skin tolerance first before you leave it on too long and shrivel up your skin (yes that has happened to me) I once left it on all day and all night and the next morning my skin was left just pulled so tight it was shriveled and took a whole day and tons of moisturizer to return to it's normal elastic self."
3758,"aromatherapy herbal soap sampler_The package was a day late but thats okay, it was worth the wait! the soaps have a strong scent to them but i like that ! they are vegan soaps so you are getting high quality  products. they can even be used on your face!the picture of the product does look like they would be big, BUT they are samples for a reason. in my opinion its worth the money. i do see myself buying this again."
1192,"Sensational_I'm not a great fan of Benefit but this product is absolutely sensational. Even if you are all thumbs, like I am, it is super-easy to create a beautiful, tasteful, smoky-eye look that is not in the least overwhelming or garish. The colors in this palette are subdued but they work perfectly. I'm on my third box of this product, and I can guarantee there will be more in the future."
1811,"Problem_The product is good, however I bought 2 bottles, one will not stop leaking, and the other the brush fell in the minute I went to use it for the first time.  Good product otherwise, just be careful when you open it for the first time to make sure that the brush is secure."
8764,"Good shampoo, but too watered down._The first thing I noticed with this shampoo is how runny it is. I expect a thicker product when using a tube type container like the one this comes in. You usually squeeze out products that come in a tube. This product is so runny it literally pours out. If you squeeze, you will quickly have a handful of shampoo in your hand. They should have either made this product thicker or put it in a bottle.Other than that problem, this is a good product. The shampoo cleanses well. It has a very subtle scent.I did not really feel that it moisturized my hair, but at least it did not dry out my hair."
898,"Fantastic Cologne_This has a very masculine scent. I like this a little bit better then Cuba (The other cigar shaped cologne). It has hints of cedar, almost a wood scent.Give it a try!"
1239,"Worked 'Just For Me!'_Hello. I researched several texturizers and this brand before my purchase.  Thank you to all who wrote a review; it helped me. I am a girl of color with tightly spiral curls. Growing up, I used perms to straighten my hair because most of my friends were, but that hid and masked my TRUE hair texture. I have not had a perm for several years and really adore and appreciate the texture and richness God has blessed me and all of you with as well.I read about texturizers and that seemed to strong for my hair. I never needed a perm on my hair; it is a cultural myth handed to many by societal norms and media. Nonetheless, I wanted something to loosen my curl pattern because I have thick, rich hair and did not want that to be hidden by chemical processing.The reviews on this product were mostly positive, but I still waited a few days after I bought it because I did not want more chemicals. I prayed. I had peace about doing this so I did!!I am SO happy that I did. I almost over processed my hair by leaving it on too long, but it came out perfect. Let me explain - briefly: I followed the directions EXACTLY. I did the strand test (4-5 minutes max - that's it according to instructions), and combed it through - not smooth it out with my hands like you do for perms. I followed the time for course hair, which was 12-16 minutes, but I should have followed the time for medium hair (8-10 minutes I believe). My hair is not course. That why I said I almost over-processed, but did not.Suggestion: read the instructions. This product loosened my curls without removing it. Gave me the sired look that I wanted!! Thanks. :)"
6108,Didn't do a thing._Unbelievably overpriced and literally didn't do a thing.  That about covers it.  A total waste of money.  I've used products a quarter of the price that performed better.
4223,"No problems here_I have no problems with this product that sound as nightmarish as everyone else's. I bought the minis to take with me to the gym and the cans don't clog, my hair never feels greasy, I have no white residue (my hair is very dark brown and long), and it doesn't weigh me down or smell too overpowering once I have worked it through my hair. I use small sprays on the sides, top and back of my head, probably 6 small sprays max and massage it into my scalp. I actually just used this tonight so I wouldn't have to have the hassle of drying and my hair is just fine. I don't know if people are using too much or if the larger bottles have functional issues but I have had no problem with the minis or the product and it has been a great solution for not over washing my hair. It's a shame that because of all of the negative reviews I think this product will be short lived. I'm sorry to hear that other people have had so many problems."
8973,Love it_Works great. My pores disappeared. Use a thick layer to make it easier to peel off.  Smells really good to me too
1803,"Best Eyelash Curler Bar None_I've been using this eyelash curler forever and ever and will never venture away from it.  I am completely bummed that they don't sell it anywhere but online anymore, but Amazon has it for the best price I've ever found.  This eyelash curler curves your lashes...not bends or crimps them.  The bar is long enough to fit around your entire lash line and get every lash you have.  There is no pinching and it's hard to slip when you press down.  I love this curler!! Worth every penny and the pads last a long time!"
5661,"everyone should own these_get them!!!pros :very cheapcan do detailsso so so so so so many designs you can do10 different size dotters.cons :none really. once i got past user error, they are awesome.i did get all 5 different colors, so no complaint on that. and i have all different sizes, so i can do a lot with them."
2397,"Pleasantly Surprised_I've been using this shampoo for well over a month now and the health of my hair has improved dramatically! My local salon was doing a promo offering free haircuts for children, so I took the opportunity to ask an employee about anti-breakage shampoos. Every time I took a shower, there'd be a large clump of hair and a friend of mine was having the same problem, which was reduced significantly with anti-breakage products. Anyway, I mentioned this to the employee and she said ultimately, it would be a good idea to speak with a doctor about it because it could indicate thyroid or other health problems. She said if it truly is a breakage problem, Redken Extreme would be her recommendation.When my cousin told me she spent $50 on her shampoo and conditioner, I thought she was crazy, but I truly see the value of it now. I love running my fingers through my hair. It is soft, more manageable, it has volume, and the ends aren't dry. I've also been losing fewer hairs in the shower, which tells me that it WORKS."
8941,Fabulous hair ties_These hair ties are great!  They don't leave ridges and yet they hold my hair.  Love them and will order more!
1408,"Feeling a little parched??_Your skin will appreciate this lovely drink of moisture in the form of this astounding body wash. Leaves skin soft, smooth, silky, hydrated, and loved all while washing away dead skin and dirt!!I found this wash works best if I use it in my last few minutes of my shower. That way all the goodness doesn't come off completely. i really love that there's no smell to this wash. I find that works better for me because I love to wear perfume that I don't want to mix fragrances with. An excellent everyday wash.Pros:HydratingNO smell (so a great product if you get irritated by fragrances or you want to wear a perfume)Creamy lather, rinses away cleanlyGreat for itchy dry unloved skinCons:I need more....."
193,Olay Serum_In the past I have spent a fortune on skin care for my face.  Then I discovered Olay. I use all Olay procucts now. I'm 57 and no one would guess that.  They have products that work for your skin type and their website can help you choose what is best for you.
7961,:)_I love this. Its a bit of a small bottle but.. I do like it. It works well and its just what I was looking for. Only problem I have is it does tend to smudge just a little sometimes.
7009,Nail art_Love this idea for beautiful and different nail art designs and creations.  My daughter and I are having fun doing these!!
534,"So far..so good!_Refer to my review of the hair conditioner which you absolutely need to go along with this product. My head has a mean patch of psoriasis on it that I've felt is more than psoriasis..maybe sensitive to the hair products I use as well..and I mgiht be right!I need more time to use it before I can give a good review, but so far, it has reduced the itching on my scalp tremendously."
3531,"Lovely_My hair is fine, straight and medium thickness.  With a bit of age it has become fragile and breaks easily.  This hydrating mask makes my hair extremely soft and silky - healthy looking - with no crazy flyaways. It does not weigh my hair down or make it look oily (and my husband absolutely loves the scent).  I have been doing 2 treatments per week for a month.  It is lovely and I will continue using it, but am not sure about breakage results just yet."
7441,"Pretty good conditioner_I have hair that is thick and goes about 3' past my shoulders and difficult to manage-it always seems to be frizzed out (just thought I would included that so you know when reading the review you can compare your hair type to see if this will work with your hair or not) I am a Head and Shoulders Loyalist, however, this conditioner works pretty well. It is smooth and goes on easily.  It smells pretty good (I would say about as good as Pantene or Garnier Fructis, but better than any of the Head and Shoulders scents I've tried) and after blow drying left my hair soft and silky, but not greasy-even the next day.  I did use it with the Clear shampoo, so I think that using both products together also helped and would recommend that you get the shampoo as well!Packaging Note: If you plan on ordering this on Amazon, be aware that it may leak in transit-Mine did leak a little bit, it was wrapped in a plastic bag so it didn't get all over the box/other items, but it was still messy and needed some rinsing off when I took it out of the box."
7042,"Very, Very Good Product. Needs Higher SPF!_This is an excellent moisturizing day cr&egrave;me and I highly recommend it. I would have given it 5 stars if it had a higher spf rating than 15.It is a white, whipped textured cr&egrave;me that spread evenly over the face and absorbs quickly into the skin. It leaves a soft dewy texture that is neither sticky nor gummy nor occlusive as some products that contain sunscreen can be. There is a fragrance but I do not find it to be objectionable.Daily wear will reduce age spots and the appearance of fine lines as well as hydrate and plump up the skin. The modest sun protection is an added plus.I found this product compared favorably with my long time favorite:Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream,which unfortunately does not contain sunscreen."
2429,Cleared up unexplained rash!_This stuff works great!  Took care of a stubborn rash that I had for months in just two days!  I applied it am and pm.  Nothing else I tried worked!
1262,"Not for me_I have used Avon's Ultima for years, but thought I would give this one a try.  I like L'Oreal products, but my skin began to show fine wrinkles after just a week.  Have gone back to Avon."
235,"the best cleanser i have used._the best cleanser i have used. foams up nicely, rinses nicely, cleans nicely. i proceeded to buy the 32 oz refill. great for sensitive skin and use before topical treatments and vanicream."
5870,"absolutely fabulous hair spray_want shiny movable healthy hair??? this is your hair spray smooth and shiny hair, touchable and healthy try it you will not be disappointed"
1513,"great help for acne scars_This really works! It takes time to show and also takes time getting used to. I have acne marks that i was trying to get rid of and decided to give this product a try. Becareful cause it does sting uncomfortably but thats just something you have to endure if you want to see result. my skin quickly got used to this, because i would leave it on for up to 10 mins or more and it didn't burn my face. I'm not sure if this is good or bad? but the description did say that the solution neutralizes on your face after 8 mins, so that explains why i was able to have it on for so long. It did lighten the scars and in some cases when i had an active zit it would actually instantly dry it up which was great. I am taking a break from this product and will restart. Definitely give it a try!"
7112,perfect foundation & concealer brush_This brush is the best I have ever used. A small amount of foundation and I mean real small comes out with a perfect finish. I would recommend this product to everyone.
3546,"Very greasy_Royal jelly or bee wax, I can't see how this product can improve my skin if it stays at the surface of my skin...The only moisturizing that it can creates will be due to the barrier it creates. Why not using petroleum jelly? No preservative...Hmmm. It means that to be able to use the whole jar before it spoils (it should be in a tube) I will have to use it on my neck too. I use it on my lips, under my eyes at NIGHT and on my throat to not waste the money I used to buy it. If you don't keep this in your bathroom (not recommended for non preservatives cosmetics), be sure to have tissues on your dresser or wherever you use it, it's greasy. I don't recommend it."
5863,"Love them_I love these plates. When I received the order it was missing a plate, but after notifying Bundle Monster, they sent that plate right away. These plates are very easy to use and don't require the Konrad stamping polish."
2588,"love it_I really like using this dhc deep cleansing oil on my face, it just feels so good. My skin looks good too, I will continue using this product.thank you DHC"
9845,"Hot mess._Is it a curling iron or a hot roller?  Unfortunately, according to my wife, it's not really either.  Trying to make a product by combining 2 others has resulted in this sub-par device.  She does not recommend it."
7199,No_Umm I mean for $3 what did I expect? It really just doesn't cover anything like I'm so disappointed.  Very
94,"Don't get this in your eyes!_The first time I used Avalon's Vitamin C eye cream, my eyes began to sting so badly that I was uncomfortable for 24 hours.  I thought that maybe I had used too much, so I tried again several days later with only a tiny amount, being careful to keep it away from my lashes.  My eyes still became uncomfortable. This is the exact opposite of what an eye cream should do.  The whole point of eye cream is to be thick enough not to melt and get into your eyes and, if it does, it should not sting. That's why eye cream is different than face cream. This one fails. I won't be using it again."
248,"perfect_I use this band to keep my hair off of my face when I do my washing routine for my face. It has a nice wide width, stretches and so far is lasting."
4891,Very good product_This is a very good product but you need to use a lot of it to work. I will recommend this product.
6486,"Fragrance free odor_This facial scrub works well...it scrubs. My face did feel clean after I used it, mainly because this is probably the roughest scrub I have used. My skin can take it; however, despite my warnings, my daughter with the delicate porcelain skin used it for about 10 seconds and then washed it off. She'll never use that again, it was too rough.My main complaint against it is the smell. I love no perfume products; but would take perfume over something that smells like a kitchen cleaner. I really like simple products (usually) and I'll finish using this tube, but I'll hold my breath."
8528,"Pretty smell and a good general shampoo_I love Nexxus hair product line. This is the 3rd Youth Renewal product ive tried, along with a conditioner and hair thickener.  I have baby fine, thin, wavy, middleaged, Caucasian hair.This shampoo smells great, and leaves my hair feeling really nice but doesn't add any extra volume or shine.  I have to say I don't like this as much as I do the Diametrx shampoo. http://www.amazon.com/Nexxus-Diametress-Luscious-Volumizing-Shampoo/dp/B0007NIRSC/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=beauty&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1368735685&sr;=1-1-spell&keywords;=diametrixA little goes a long way, so its very economical. For normal hair, this would be a great shampoo. If you need a little volume, try diametrix instead."
5177,This works._The hair in my brows has never grown in the same (upward and out) direction. This holds every hair perfectly in place.
1158,"Very rich_They aren't kidding when they say this is on the high side of the Rich scale.  It does leave a layer of grease on your hands when using a full pump but since this is for Very Dry skin, it is understandable.  I just make sure I don't need to touch anything in the new few minutes and it restores my hands from being dry in no time."
3287,"Clearasil Daily Clear Vanishing Acne Treatment Cream, 1 Ounce (Pack of 3)_This does help with acne.  In the summer it comes in handy especially when using heavier sunscreens that can cause more breakouts.  In the winter use moisturizers at night to counteract drying.  The 2.5% may be better for everyday use.  The 10% is great a couple times a week at night."
7824,"Ohhhh i love!_Im a kleancolor addict, i want them all! These cute little bottles are great to throw in my overnight bag, they are also perfect for trying new colors. I have a vast collection of nail polishes so the smaller bottle are usually great for me, as even if i painted every person i knows nails on a constant rotation my nail polish collection would probably still last me more than a few years.These are perfect for my nieces (4 and 7), and will be getting some for my granddaughter when she is old enough. I love the colors so pretty, awesome on their own, but pop over black, and shine on just about every other color. I have a feeling these little gems will be needing to see their big sisters soon. As i use them so much, and when my little ones (god-daughter, nieces, granddaughter) and not so little (mother, daughter-in-laws) come to visit, they tend to aim straight for these. I have other mini sets but these are defiantly the favorites.As with any glitter a little harder to remove than regular nail polish, just soak your nails in remover for a couple minutes and rub with a cotton pad dipped in the remover, and it comes right off."
2017,"Nice!_This does it's job, easy to use, nice color, and stays on well. Prevents bleeding with gloss too which was a nice surprise. I really like it and will re-order."
1249,"Great hairbrush_I do not appreciate the price, extremely expensive for a hairbrush! although, so far, it has been a great product, and I am satisfied with the hairbrush.  If it wasn't so expensive I'd probably purchase a couple more of them"
7025,Beautiful Colors!_I Love the way it goes on. Colors are beautiful.  I will buy more when needed. Thank you very much!
1728,"Super_I use this product everyday, love it.  Can not live without...It give my thinish, flat hair the lift it needs"
5605,Cleans pores_I think that the best thing this mask does is cleaning the pores. I do not use it for anything else but to clean my pores and reduce their size. It does a great job. It also smells really good and leaves your skin feeling velvety.
4066,Dannii_This is a gorgeous medium orchid with awesome golden shimmer. Perfect for spring/summer. It applies like a dream and dries quickly. I highly recommend it.
8357,Love it_What can I say except I love this color and this brand of polish It goes on so nice and last a long time I use it as a polish and also as a nail art on its own.  The holograph looks so nice both ways!!
7403,"What are the ingredients?!?!?  UPDATE_Why can't I find the ingredients for this product anywhere? One reviewer stated that they're not even on the bottle.How can I make an informed decision? The FDA is totally useless. They don't regulate ANYTHING.We're all just guinea pigs. Btw, just referencing animal testing makes me sick.UPDATE............I emailed the company and they sent me the list of ingredients. It's not pure argan oil but a combination of things inluding silicones. Sorry I dont have the ingredients anymore but I didn't see anything that concerned me so I ordered it.I LOVE IT!"
3880,best hair spray ever_This is the best hair spray out there.  I use this when I curl my hair w/ a curling iron or use hot rollers. a few sprays and your hair will look fresh and styled HOURS later. I swear by this hair spray.
628,"The no messing around clarifying shampoo that stinks_Alright, first and foremost this stuff works and it works exceptionally well. It really does. It's incredible, it just rips all of the products out of your hair and leaves it spotless (which, for many people, will make their hair shiny if their hair is reasonably healthy). In my opinion it is superior at clarifying to other shampoos, but sadly, I have to use one of the other ones.The only thing I can find wrong with this shampoo, and it's kind of a big thing, is the smell. Oh god the smell. I don't know what possessed the people down at Neutrogena to make them think scenting a shampoo like your grandfather's overbearing musk cologne was a good idea. This stuff is scented REALLY strongly like musk (or something... I don't even know). I couldn't take it anymore personally, and use a product that is inferior functionally, but I got tired of trying to cover it up after I used it every time."
1364,"Best blue hair dye out there!_So I've been dying my hair crazy colors for the past 8 years.  Of those 8 yeas, I have spent the past three blue.  Blue is definitely one of the most difficult colors to achieve, and a lot can go wrong trying to obtain it.  In order to really get the most out of this dye, bleach your hair.  A lot.  Think it's ready? Bleach it again.  And then add toner.  To avoid the &#34;muddy&#34; look, you have to get ALL copper and orange tones out of your hair.A lot of blue dyes either fade way too quickly, or fade to nasty brown and green tones.  This one, however, gradually turns into an almost purple tinted light blue.  Because it's not an offensive color, it's possible to go a little longer between dye jobs, making things easier on both your scalp and your wallet.Other awesome things about this product include:-It's vegan and cruelty free!-No harsh chemicals,-No offensive smells-The cream formula is easy to apply"
9541,"Smooth_For a lower price point shampoo, I would definitly give it two thumbs up.  I usually use Big Sexy Hair products, and find that they don't always leave my hair feeling both clean and moisturized.  I feel like with most shampoos you have to sacrifice one for the other.  However, this shampoo made my hair feel clean and hydrated.  The only thing I wish it had more of was scent.  I like when I can smell my hair all day, but with this shampoo, the smell didn't last long."
7814,LOVE IT!_This came to me fairly quickly and is perfect for what I need.  I use it with Urban Decay's Naked Liquid Foundation line and it gives me whatever coverage I need from light to heavy.  The brush is perfectly stiff (but so very soft!) and angled for just how I need it!
931,"Awesome Shampoo_I love, love this shampoo. This lathers up nice and cleans your hair without leaving it stripped and dry.  I also use the Shampure Conditioner with this too.  The scent in this shampoo is heavenly! I have used this shampoo for years and will keep buying it. If you have not tried it you must, and can buy a sample size to try it out.  You will not be disappointed."
4750,WOW!  A product that lives up to the hype!_I am so glad I listened to the reviews and purchased this product.  I used to hate my hair curly until I tried this product.  Absolutely AMAZING!
9926,"Very Gentle Shower Brush_For thick hair this brush is too gentle, except as a shower detangling brush. For fine hair, like mine, this works well in or out of the shower.It is extremely lightweight and very gentle. So this would also be great for a child with a sensitive scalp. When I was a child, I remember not brushing a matte that got under my hair for several days because my head was so sensitive. Man, I wish my mom had a brush like this one when she ripped me almost bald-headed getting that matte worked out.Sample provided without obligation."
7596,"Great cream, low price_I really like this BB cream. I read a lot of reviews about how BB cream can make your face look greyish. This does a tiny bit but not anything noticeable. It covers a lot of my light acne scars and evens out my skin tone. I feel great putting this on instead of makeup because it feels lighter and  seems better for my skin. I can even wear it to the gym!"
4855,Five Stars_I like this color!
1134,"Good light, quality mirror_Pros- excellent lighting9x and regular -both without distortionslittle tray for small items like tweezersplugs in, no battery replacement worriesConI am not able to get the regular view mirror to be the primary mirror.  Its always the 9x mirror that will be the closest to you. They do flip, but its with a rotating arm, and no way to change it.  I am thinking of unscrewing it and reversing it myself.That being said, its only a minor issue, and if I wasnt so OCD, might not bother me."
5266,"Very disappointed!_First of all, the model used in the video didn't look like she needed much of a lift. She had NO turkey neck, so yes, it made her neck appear a bit tighter.  The facelift one will pull the skin tighter to smooth out the 'parens' around the mouth, but after a while, the band starts to hurt, because you need to pull it tight enough to pull the skin.  However, if you have TURKEY NECK, this product will NOT work for that.  If you have short hair, there are some disadvantages. One, is that it's hard to hide the tape that you stick on the sides of your face. Two, the tighter you  pull the bands, the longer the tail will be, therefore, the tail will hang down in the back if your hair isn't long enough to cover it.  And lastly,  when removing the bands, it will also pull some of your hair, and that too, is uncomfortable.  All in all, as the old saying goes.... 'if it's too good to be true...then it probably isn't'."
4376,"Nice!_I saw a makeup artist on tv use this, dotting the corners of the eye to illustrate how it makes your eyes pop.  So, I decided to look around Amazon for white eyeliner and based on reviews decided on this one.  I love it, it does make your eyes pop, it's become on those must have makeup items for me! I definitely recommend!"
1663,"excellet product for damaged hair_I have been using the product on and off for 4 years now...I have relaxed hair and anytime it starts to break, or thin out I use this for around 4 weeks and instantly I see results. you have to use another conditioner after using it because it leaves your hair very dry and you should not use it every week because it is very strong. it is expensive but it is worth it. my bottle lasts around 6 months because I use it every 2 weeks."
1641,"Descent product. Not drying like other product. Not as incredible as some other comments either..._This product cleans well without over drying your skin. However you can find other similar cleansers like this in drug stores with cheap price as well. It is good, but not a miracle product for me."
5390,"Good Stuff!_I have been searching all over for a great, fresh moisturizer for my face. I finally came upon this and after reading the reviews was determined to get it. I have very oily skin and didn't realize that the packaging stated for dry skin so I was a bit leery. But it has worked wonders. It leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed and with no shine - which is great!!! I will continue to buy this for as long as I possible can."
6343,Gets the job done_The foam heads do what they are designed to do.  They are sturdy and do not disintegrate easily when pins are pushed in or removed.  Price point and quality are good.
7912,good variety of colors._I just got these and there are many color stones other companies offer the amount of stones are adequate for my home decorations for my toes. Looking forward to using them
4032,"It's a really nice product_I was so excited when I saw the package at my door. But when I use it, I don't really find a huge difference from many other leave in conditioners. It smells wonderful though. And maybe it is better than most leave in conditioners. But I can not tell. It's a great product, but it's not super amazing. It's just good. Just good."
7020,Gorgeous!_This is soooooo gorgeous!  It's almost like a neon purple.  I love how creamy and long lasting the formula is. This can be worn alone or as a primer base for other eyeshadows.
4994,"Seems to work._I tried making an oil mix spray for mosquito repellant since I live in the woods. I have a bunch of herbs and such on my back deck and going out to grab some lead me to come back in (five minutes later) with at least 5-10 new bites. I was sick of spraying myself down with deet for such a short trip outside so I bought this stuff. It seems to work okay from what I see... but it is very strong and will linger for a very long time. I'm not 100% sure if it works excellent due to me not being out there over a long period of time but the initial application seems to keep the bugs away.Oh, and my boyfriend. Keeps him away, too."
5000,Great basecoat!_Loving it!!! Thanks =)Easy to use and keep my nail very health very well!Fast shipping with good value product! Will return to buy =)
8806,"cute but runny_my customers love these. they say theyre cute and they go well with designs. However, theyre not perfect. The bows are clear and the animal prints are like painted on the flat back of the bows. Out of 50, maybe 5 of them, the prints were kind of runny or didnt cover the entire bow. But its still a great deal. Nothing can be perfect 100%."
7921,"great variety_I got this particular mix because it seemed to have a good variety of colors, and I'm not disappointed.  There have only been a couple of times that I've thought &#34;Oh, I wish it had this color too&#34;, but for the price this really is a great deal.  Much less expensive than paying $5-10 to have it added onto your pedicure at a salon, and all you need to do to prep is lay down a top coat and add the stones before it dries!"
9970,Works quickly and efficiently_I'm always looking for new products to use under my eyes because the lines there are so prominent it makes me look older and tired which is not what I want. At first I thought the bottle was kind of small but then I found out that a little does indeed go a long way. I have been using this for almost 2 weeks now and the lines under my eyes are becoming subtle. I have also been using this on the side &#34;frown&#34; lines on my face and over my eyelids. I am really liking what it has been doing for my skin and would recommend to anyone looking to make their fine lines and wrinkles smooth out in little time. This product is not oily or greasy and there is no smell. It's so gentle. I can't express how happy dead sea minerals have made my skin feel so much better within the past months. You really should consider picking up a few of Adovia's products because they all are high quality and have been working so well for me.
33,"Used to spend a mint!  not any more......_Love Cetaphil!  Used to spend big bucks on those fancy dancy products at the dept. store.  Tried this at the recommendation of a dermatologist who told me all that I really wanted was a good moisturizer....that a prescription would be needed by those companies if they lived up to their claims.....I've been using Cetaphil ever since....also the cleanser.You just can't go wrong.  It's  non -greasy, keeps your skin moist all day....and before you go to bed, after washing your face, all night!  It can be used all over your body actually:  those elbows!I get told all the time that I look much younger than I am, and also that my skin is beautiful....well, I dunno about all that, but any help I get is because of Cetaphil.  I also like bare minerals radiance (slight shimmer) and Nars for some of their liquids (blushes) that I put on to make my skin have a dewy look."
7527,"Perfect Top Coat_I have purchased this many times before. This is the perfect top coat in terms of shine, fast dry and overall last. When the nail chips, the top coat, color coats and base coats chip all together. I have a feeling its the top coat as I have changed color coats and base coats and this same thing happens. I like it better than some nail polishes feeling like they damage my nails by chipping a little at a time.Only cons are its super chemical smell.I would purchase this again. And I would recommend this to anyone who does nails on their own or out because the drying rate is really impressive!"
6925,best hairspray ever_This is one of the best hairsprays I have ever used.  It holds your hairstyle without that sticky feeling.  I would recommend this to anyone with any harstyle.
7447,"Snap, Crackle and Pop!_I used Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Conditioner for some time before I finally wrote this review. At first, I liked it very much. I am a conditioner junkie, and will give any new product a shot if it seems to fill the bill. However, my initial delight with this conditioner sent me running back to my other conditioners when I realized that the initial softness that I felt was being replaced by a dry, brittle feeling -- almost as though I had left soap in my hair. Not good at all! Furthermore, when I gently comb through my hair when it is dry, I am suddenly experiencing breakage, and this is NOT a problem I had before I used this conditioner.In essence, I do not recommend this product, and I am glad that I waited long enough to have gone almost through the entire bottle so that I could be sure about my results. FYI, I always thoroughly rinse my hair out in the shower, but the residue from Clear Scalp & Hair seems almost impossible to get out."
9176,"Nothing special_I heard about this brush & had high expectations, but it takes out as much hair as my regular brushes do.  This brush is no different than any other brush"
2169,"This is a winner!_I have tried so many products meant to add shine and body and some structure to my hair.  Either they end up drying my hair out, make it too pieced out or crunchy or would weigh my hair down.  Kevin Murphy is the winner.  I use a small amount, rub it in my hands and apply to damp, combed out hair and smooth it in.  It instantly adds a shine to it and oddly enough makes it easier to comb through.  I then blow dry and viola!  Shiny, bouncy hair that has a little structure and edge to it.  For what its worth, I have very long, fine hair that is really finicky.  I also don't care for chemically products and preservatives, this is simple and the smell is awesome."
8956,"Excellent straightener_Yay, a quick heating straightener, and you can adjust the temperature so you can use a cooler temp and don't have to burn all the hair off your head. Hair doesn't stick to the plates so you're not pulling a ton out every time you straighten."
5007,"No Great Product_I had this product for less than 6 months.  The hair dryer has a large hood so it can be used with large rollers.The set up is easy and it's not as noisy as some dryers I have used. It lighter than I expected but the heat is very good. I did have concerns about the knob due to past reviews.  Thus far the knob has not come off but the heat is no longer hot at the highest level.  The high heat is medium and the medium heat is low. And no, it did not drop on the floor or anywhere. Very disappointed after less than a year use.  Review revised 3/06/10."
838,perfect_Strongly recommended. One of my girlfriend said it it too manly. She loved it very much.Just buy this cologne without hesitance. You will understand what I am saying after you buy. You will not regret. Go for it!
3542,"Only thing that has worked on my KP_I have severe keratosis pilaris on my upper arms, and this product is the only thing that has worked! I usually buy the kit with the lotion included as well, but the lotion lasts way longer than the body wash so I just bought the wash this time by itself. I just scrub my arms with the wash and apply the lotion once each day, and my arms look much better! The price on Amazon is also way more affordable than what I pay at my dermatologist's office."
1382,only real red_I used to use Revlon's RED color then I found this and this one is certainly more of a true red. It seems to have lasted longer than other name brand nail polishes.
5565,"Conditioner is okay, shampoo not so much_I have already reviewed the shampoo - suffice it to say that it was horrible.  Turned my hair into a giant matte, couldn't get down to the scalp to get it clean, etc.However, the conditioner saved the day.  Despite the crappy performance of the shampoo, this conditioner managed to smooth out the dry, tangled mess the shampoo had made out of my hair.  My hair was fairly lank and flat the rest of the day, but I think that was more because the shampoo did not get the scalp clean than the fault of the conditioner.Scent is pleasant, but quite strong and will remain obvious throughout the day, so make sure you like it."
4312,"Bingo again!_I have reordered NuFountain products over & over again. They claim to mix fresh batches when you order which is niiiiice. I use these products &#34;mixed&#34; in with a carrier oil like argan or coconut. I like that they are generous with the vitamin C content, But it's still affordable."
4189,"BLUE_Love the different shades of blue, I especially love the silver color. Can't wait to use them all and try new designs."
2301,Might be discontinued_This is a great powder.  My only problem with the product is that it crumbles when the container gets nearly empty.
1337,"spray mist bottle_Very good quality item. Fine mist spray that works well. Got 2 of them. You know how once you find something that works for you, they improve it? Not taking any chances  ; )"
7994,layla mirror effect polish_This polish was nothing what I expected. It did not have the &#34;mirror&#34; effect and for the price I was very disappointed. The polish also did not arrive when it was supposed to. I can buy polish at a cheaper price and get het same look.
204,Nice oil_Great oil. There is no smell at all and I use it daily on my face (wet skin before applying to help it soak in) and also as a makeup remover.
9133,"I'll continue to use it, but..._Pond's Luminous Finish BB Plus Cream in Medium was a good match for my skin, went on ultra-smoothly, however...I was just a bit disappointed that the coverage was lacking. I felt it was more like a moisturizer with a tiny bit of color to it. I really wish that there was more color there, but I will continue to use it because it promises results in two weeks. That's quite a claim!The product is all-around good quality. I used a powder on top of it to add more depth to the coverage, so I was good to go. For more casual occasions, I'd use it alone."
3643,Redken is really amazing._This is a great product. I have 'Normal hair' and this shampoo and conditioner are light and keeps my hair 'not greasy.:' Love it and it smells great.
2678,"great product_I love this product.  So far it is working wonders.  I have only taken 3 days of medication but the relief has been noticeable.  I did have one complaint.  They (not sure who) placed a sticker directly across the back of the back covering the Warning, Directions, Other and Interaction.  This isn't good for some people and they really should place it somewhere else."
1524,"I need a white nail polish and so, why not?_I thought why not?  I am glad that I did, because it works well with the art plates I got from Konad. Yes, I recommend to buy."
8141,"This makes a good day cream._Total Effects moisturizer PLUS intense serum is light weight, and works great under my foundation.  The sunscreen seems to work fine too.  I did notice that it does seem to help with skin dullness and tone, in addition to fine lines and dryness.  I have not been a big fan of Olay products in the past because I didn't like the scent, and their products would sometimes cause irritation.  However, Total Effects smells nice and feels fine on my skin.  I'll use it for a day cream but it's too light for a night cream for my dry skin."
2069,"Question for Quimica users?  Please answer_Hi, I use Quimica Nail Hardner and love it.  However I was one of those folk's that wanted to triple start my nails fresh after removing artificials and of course, I applied way to much too soon.  So I burned a few nail beds and also started getting the marbled white (too much keratin cross linking from the Formaldeyde).Anyway, I stopped using it to help my nails heal and now am doing it the correct way.  I am starting by nourishing my cuticles and nail to bring back to health as much as possible.  The nail matrix and cuticle are what needed to be treated first and is what maintains the health of my nail regardless of what hardner I use.  You mess up your cuticle, you mess up your nail.The nourisher I am using requires nightly application along with the cuticle cream.  I am to strip all hardners nightly and reaplly UNDER the hardner, then re-apply your hardner very thin one layer.  Of course, we all know Quimica is to be applied one, super thin applicaton in center mid nail to tip staying clear of sides of nail, cuticle area and skin.  I got that.  I also get that with Quimica the instuctions read apply once a week at most.  However, if I REMOVE the old layer nightly with non-acetone nail remover can I re-apply nightly?  This way I get the best of both.  The Quimica to use as my hardner as I believe it really works. But then I can also treat my nail and cuticle with my Trind Nail Nourisher/and Cuticle balsam which (to me) is the best nail/cuticle nourisher out there (my belief).  Quicmia is terrible for your skin and cuticles and I have learned it is only a matter of time (for me) it will dry up my nail bed and could even separate from nail bed if I use alone or too much so I want to avoid that as much as possible by keeping my nail nourished and hydrated nightly.  Trind nail balsam and cuticle balsam do have their own nail hardner but I prefer to stick with Quimica.  I also have tried using cuticle lotions, etc on top of the Quimica but I feel that complicates the effectiveness of Quimica.  Oily cuticle applications seem to not work well over hardners as it is counter productive.  However, using Trind nail nourisher/cuticle products are best because they are oil free and saturate inside the nail udner the hardner but again, they need to be applied nightly for best results and we are to remove the harnder nightly to get it on the bare nail.Will this be ok to apply nightly if I remove the old layer with nail polish remover hense (in my mind) I am applying a fresh layer (one thin layer) every night which to me is same thing as once a week if I remove the old.  I know it is not good to continue to layer it over and over that is way too much.I read someone did do a strip/reapply nightly but never heard back how that went.  I am looking to do same thing only for me it is not to speed up the formaldyne but to ensure my bare nail is completely hydrated and cuticles remain protected with cuticle balm.  The products I am using for cuticle/nail nourishing are oil free and their instructions are to put under the harnder nightly and are very speicifc to remove the hardner nightly and apply fresh layer.  I just am not sure if Quimica can be done this way.Any advice would be appreciated. With hydrating my nail and cuticle and having an oil free nourisher under this product to me would be a win/win as for me by itself it dries out my nail too much.  I know you can apply the noursihber over the one layer but feel that to really keep my nail nourished I need to remove it nightly to get under the hardner.  especially since my nails are weak, splitting and very, very dried out from the fake nails."
6151,Makes a difference._It does not really look like 'false lashes' to me but it is good and I use it. Creates a dramatic look. I still have to put some effort to separate clumps after I apply.
9219,I like it_I don't absolutely adore the color but it performs as expected.  It is a great line from this company.  Color is just a personal preference.
7501,"I regret making this purchase_I have had Conair hot rollers for years, without complaint.  I purchased this new one because I thought that the rollers would be bigger than what I have (they aren't) and the fast heat up time sounded good.  They do heat very quickly but, understandably, are extremely hot to the touch and I keep scorching one of my fingers.  My biggest issue with this product however is the design.  The clips - they don't hold my long hair in place and when they do, they leave marks.  And, they are very inconvenient because there is no convenient way to store the them in the unit.  What a pain.  I just cannot recommend this product."
5892,"Looks like I have Falsies when I where it.._This is by far the best mascara I have used in a long time. ( and i have bought name brand mascara at Sephora for $15+, only to be disappointed). Since I started using it I have gotten several compliments and other girls asking me what mascara I use. Buy this, you will not be disappointed for the price!Tip: Make sure you wiggle the mascara at the base of your lashes and it will give you more volume and will almost give a subtle &#34;eyeliner&#34; effect. Never pump the mascara wand in the tube either, all it's doing is getting air in there and causing it to dry out quicker. Hope this helps anyone reading this."
5451,"More primer like_I did like this it is actually more a primer like, than a tinted moisturizer.  Very similar to benefit pores no more (I think I like benefit's better) It comes out of the tube very orange looking, I tried it on my hand first and it was so silky and instantly changed to match my skin.  On my face it felt the same way but I think I could see my pores more around my nose (the worst area).  So I was slightly disappointed.  Still good for a primer but I wish it did more."
4427,"Felt like regular conditioner_This 'treatment' seemed like nothing more than regular conditioner in a fancy block container with an appealing label. This 'treatment' was extremely thin. I though it was going to be richer, creamier, and thicker. It was not at all.And I actually slept with my hair saturated in this stuff. I rinsed it out in the morning, & I felt no difference in the texture of my hair. And if there was a difference, it was not noticeable to the naked eye.Pantene conditioners are pretty good, but next time I will just stick to purchasing my conditioner in one of those longer slimmer bottles....its cheaper. :)"
5789,"good moisturizer_it's a good night time moisturizer. Silky, slightly spackle-like texture. Does contain fragrance which my skin takes time to get used to it."
1432,Helps stop dandruff on scalp_One of the better camellia oils.The smell isnt too strong and it will help the hair after a while of use.This oil  got rid of my boyfriends dandruff immediately after applying and also made his hair shiny*Helps seal my ends for protection
5403,"Great product - Bad price._I used to only use this product when I went to the tanning salon. It gives results quickly and works very well but I wouldn't go as far to say it's the best I have ever used. It gives you a dark tan and doesn't leave you with orange palms. It has a really great smell to it and isn't too thick or too thin. It rubs in well into your skin and makes you feel smooth. The issue to me is price because I have found other products that work just as well as this lotion but is less then half the price of this bottle. I no longer use this product because of price, I refuse to pay so much for a lotion that delivers the same as other cheaper brands."
7300,"Great Shampoo for Dealing With Dandruff_Clear Men ScalpTherapy 2 shampoo promises 'to control dandruff symptoms at the source', 'gently cleanses and conditions to leave hair manageable with a deep clean sensation' and is 'clinically proven to reduce scalp dryness'. I honestly don't know whether all of its claims are true, but since I started using it a few weeks, my dandruff has disappeared; no signs of all of flaking or of feeling lumps on my scalp.  It bills itself as a '2 in 1 dry scalp hydration anti-dandruff daily shampoo and conditioner', whose ingredients are' 10 nutrients and botanical activities including ginseng, tea tree and natural mint'. The bottom line is of course whether it works, and I think it does. Moreover, I think this has been among the most effective shampoos I have used to control my dandruff symptoms. In short, this earns the highest possible I can recommend for a shampoo. I hope others will agree too with my favorable assessment."
7610,"love it_love love love this color. I got lots of compliments on it. you should get this, its so amazing. :)"
8334,"Clear, Smooth, Energizing_This is a nice, smooth and energizing face wash. I used it several times and so fare have really liked it. It's much smoother than some other face washes that I've used in the past. It has a nice subtle, yet quite distinct, scent to it that feels very &#34;masculine.&#34; You can use this wash by itself in the morning or the evening to wash your face, or as a pert of your shower routine. The 4 ounce package is generous enough in my experience to last for many months, even up to half a year depending on how often do you use it. In general, I'm very happy with this product."
2399,"best shampoo & conditioner_Came exactly as described, with the shampoo & conditioner. Great products, I really love this shampoo & conditioner. Had no issues with the seller, came on time and was packaged perfectly :-)"
9113,"Nailed It_Gel nails look great and last long. But removing the gel polish is a time consuming hassle if you do it yourself and expensive if you go to the salon. Panasonic's entry is a portable, battery operated device that comes with three attachments. The first is a sanding device which makes it possible for the nail polish remover to penetrate. After the polish has softened, the gel remover/cuticle care attachment is used. There is also a nail filing attachment.The implement itself is attractively packaged in a fuchsia cylinder. I was put off by the fact that there was only Japanese writing on the package. The instructions also look cheesy, mimeographed sheets, cut and stapled together but the contents are adequate. The do refer to '1' and '0' but there is a clearly marked on and off button so don't waste your time looking for those numbers. The AA battery is not included. Set up is easy. Just twist top open and insert the battery. The assorted heads attached with ease. I thought the device worked well, with more than adequate power. I found the cuticle care head hard and prefer using a orange wood cuticle stick.I have limited the number of times I get my nails done to a couple of times a year, that is for special occasions and vacations. This due to a number of factors including  time and activity demands,  economics and  the health of my nails. Gel nails look great but the constant upkeep is a deterrent. Now that adequate and affordable do it yourself applications are availableSally Hansen Salon Pro Gel Starter Kit, Shell We Dance?andSensatioNail by Nailene Gel Polish Starter Kit, Raspberry Wine, 1 kitthat may change and  this device makes sense. I don't know that it saves a whole lot of time but it is fun and convenient and much cheaper than going to the salon. While I do like the look of the device, it does not contain all three heads. You can leave one on and close the capsule but the other two do not have a carrying case. If you love the look of gel nails, this device should streamline removal and save you some money. Recommended."
7396,"Smells great and works just as well!_My boyfriend was always complaining about his face feeling dry. But it wasn't just his face. He goes to the gym to lift weights almost every day, and the result was hard, dry, callused palms. He was using my lotions to combat his perpetual dryness, but they had a distinctly feminine smell. This wasn't a big deal to him, but when I found out about the Nivea for Men line, I instantly picked up a bottle.It smells fantastic. It's a nice, manly scent, but it's not overpowering. I love that it keeps skin feeling soft and moisturized, but it's not wet feeling when you put it on (I hate having to wait for a lotion to dry). The Nivea for Men is the same quick drying but moisturizing formula. Put it on and be on your way. Which is great! This has definitely improved the softness level of hard palms.Nivea is my favorite lotion, and the Nivea for Men solidified this even more -- I'd give it ten stars if I could."
4635,Too oily._This has something in it that doesn't work for me. And it is not oil free. My face seems to react to even &#34;natural&#34; fruit and vegetable oils. I didn't have an acne breakout after using this. My face just looked red and kind of stung. I think my skin is just sensitive to a particular ingredient in this lotion. I was bummed because it promised so much. Hope it works for others.
8385,"Happy_I love to do my nails and ran out of rhinestones. These were a great buy, Haven't got to use them yet. But will be within days."
2581,Best AHA around!_I use the whole acne.org regimen and I've had great results. My skin is finally clear and beautiful. All the cystic acne is gone- finally after years and years of dealing with it.
8513,"Great lather, nice scent and thicker fuller hair, what more can you ask for?_You see a LOT of 'thicker-fuller' shampoos out there, so when I tried this I didn't expect much.All I have to say is 'WOW' this stuff is really great!The first this I noticed is the thickness and richness of the shampoo itself, you really don't need a lot to get a great lather, I put what I usually use (about a palm-full) and noticed I had WAY too much shampoo lather going on!(NOT that I am complaining, it's great that you don't need as much to get a nice lather-cleaning)I do 'beat' on my hair, I get it dirty, working with metal, great grinding etc..I don't wash it everyday, and don't use conditioner. This shampoo cleans it great! (I wash, rinse repeat) It also is stronger and does not get greasy loking iof I skip a day ort two of washing my hair.So does it work? .. YES!!!While my hair is not thinning I keep it long and the hair *itself* is thin,  after a few days of using this shampoo my wife noticed saying 'Your hair more full, are you using my conditioners?' it does look more full just as advertised!Now I am not too show what exactly the caffeine and calcium *does* but I do notice a difference just after a week of using this product. Finally, the scent, it is a nice *clean* scent, not too fragrant, but it does have a light 'mint' scent if I had to describe it.*****Jim"
7412,"This product is fantastic_I would not be without this product ever again if I can help it.  I am picky with these types of products and most seem to be a waste of money.  I really like the whole line so far, but this is by far, my favorite!"
7296,Clear Men Scalp Therapy  Cool Mint_Just tried this shampoo and it seems to be a good product.  The shampoo smells like mint and lathers easily.  Dried my hair soon afterwards (just glad to have a good head full of hair!) and the process was smooth and made my hair manageable.Amazon appears to have done a better job shipping this product as another shampoo product I had requested was somewhat damaged.Product appears to be good.Recommended.
1160,"Not high quality_I got the starter kit after hearing reviews on the products. Well The foundation doesn't stay and it doesn't cover well. It also broke me out. Also after cleaning the brush, gently btw, the top part broke off! It will fit back on the stick part but it falls off and wobbles around. I just threw the makeup away as well as that stick. I do use the brush part though for brushing away any stray eyeshadow. That is really all it's good for. So that is why i gave it 2 stars as I did get a good tool to brush away unwanted makeup and perfect my look. Though I'm sure I could have found a tool like that at Ulta for cheaper."
5309,"Not for people with perfume allergies!_This made my hair soft but it took a few uses to determine it was the reason I was sneezing, had watery eyes and a headache. The scent is very strong (and bad!!), and it made me have miserable allergies due to the scent which stayed in my hair for several hours. If you have allergies to cheap perfume and cologne, DON'T buy this. This is going in the garbage!"
2875,"terrible for fair skin_I have very fair skin (think German) and I do have a hard time finding a decent foundation or concealer for my face. This looks totally ORANGE on my face. Its awful. This is also the lightest shade, so please don't waste your money."
3285,"Best alternative to prescription facewash I've found_I am in my twenties, and I STILL break out like a teen. I used to have a prescription facewash, but when it ran out I couldn't afford to get more and my face was SUFFERING.Luckily, I found this Clearasil wash. Is it perfect? No. If I got one or two zits when using my prescription, then I get two or three using this. But that's A LOT better than the 7-8 I get without washing my face.I do recommend getting a good facial lotion to use after this, as sometimes it leaves me dry. But not always, which is curious. Maybe that's just my skin. I'm a freak-o-nature or something."
4522,"this actually works pretty good_if you are looking for a miracle this product works surprisingly well on melasma.  I have very light brown spots remaining on my cheek bones but i have only used the product 3 times.  I like using it at night best, I tried mixing it with my facial moisturizer during the day but I don't like thinking someone may think I stink.  It is not oily at all, it actually feels silky.  I just wish it didn't smell.  Its not overbearing in fact its kind of fishy herby, more herby.  Not sure how to describe it, but it dissipates after an hour or so.  I almost wonder if you could mix it with some vanilla or peony essential oil safe for your skin or something to mask the smell.  But otherwise, it's a great affordable little treasure."
353,"A little goes a LONG way_I love this product.  It is working.  I have used other progesterone creams and have had great results too.  After some research I decided on this one.  It has a great and long standing reputation.  It is paraben and soy free.First--because of my experience with other products, I thought I knew what I was doing.  I hadn't been using any progesterone cream in a while and was definitely feeling the effects of too much estrogen and packing on some weight.  It was time to get back on the bus.  I wasn't surprised by the sore breasts and sleepiness at first.  It takes  a while to balance out the estrogens that have run amuck. HOWEVER, I was using waaay too much of this cream initially. My other creams were like two tablespoons or something and were kind of watery in appearance.  This one is a very thick cream and it rubs in completely without a slimy feeling. It takes some effort to rub it in entirely.  The tube prescribes a dime sized amount.  My other creams took so much more that I misjudged this cream.  I probably used a silver dollar sized amount for the first two weeks.  Man, the impacts were noticeable.  The expected 'randiness' was stronger than ever.  The erotic dreams became almost nightly.  Not bad side effects, but tough on the single girl.  The men around me commented that I looked as though I might snap them in half.  It is funny how our primal instincts protect us...I suggest getting the single-use packages at first so you won't make the same mistake.  It really is a tiny amount.  And MORE is not always better.  It isn't terribly dangerous to use too much now and then; your body has a way of regulating some of those errors with ease.  But the point of this product is to balance your hormones.  Using the little packages helped me get used to how much is reasonable.  Now I have moved back to the tube.  The tube lasts a LONG time when not used like an after-bath-splash.When I first  start progesterone creams, they make my boobs sore...as mentioned, and they almost immediately lengthen my monthly cycle between periods.  (I have a luteal phase defect, so this is good).  They also initially make me feel insanely 'friendly' toward the opposite sex.  All of those things level off over time.  Now I have started dropping the little pudge I had acquired...and the sex drive is back to normal so the neighborhood men no longer clutch their robes tight and run back indoors when they see me looking at them.Talk to your doctor.  Get your saliva tested.  After you've decided that bio-identicals is the best option for you, I suggest this cream highly."
3462,Philolosophy Eye Hope Eye Cream - it's ok but wouldn't buy it again_I don't care for this product & won't purchase it again.  I know it had many positive comments online which is why I purchased it but just didn't care for it because I couldn't see a difference in my eye area & didn't like the way it rubbed off when adding highlighter.
7039,"Love it!_I love L'Oreal Age Perfect Day Cream for Mature Skin. It goes on smoothly, is quickly absorbed and leaves my face feeling silky. I also like that it has an spf. I've only used it for a week so I don't know how it is going to do on age spots but I hope it works on the one that I have recently noticed on my right cheek. UGH! I'm getting old!"
6373,"Tired of laying your hairdryer on the counter?_When I need to reposition a round brush while drying my hair, I lay the running hairdryer on my counter. As a result, anything lightweight blows away. This Holder Caddy is the perfect solution. I hang it on the side of a drawer, so I can quickly slip my hairdryer into it when I need both hands. When finished with my hair, I put it in a drawer until the next time. It doesn't collapse flat (measures 3 1/2&#34; when folder), but for the grief it saves me during the drying process, I moved something less important in one of my drawers to make room for it. It's extremely well made and attractive."
4776,"Easy to use, but the straighening power is limited!_I've been told over and over to straighten my hair by hairdressers, but I'm not really very into fussy hairdo-ing.  I finally decided to give it a whirl, and was a little nervous, as I've never used a straightener alone before!  But this was super simple to use---I was almost confused by the directions as they were TOO simple!  They seemed to do a good job on my hair, but my hair is long and only a little wavy.  I liked how it looked when straightened.  However, then my son asked to try these.  He has EXTREMELY curly hair---it naturally forms an Afro, and we are not African-American, so he stands out.  He usually likes it, but wanted to see if he could get a different look.  The straightener just didn't seem to be up to the challenge, however.  We worked and worked and worked at it, but only got a very slight curl reduction.  His hair is very thick and short.  Maybe part of the problem was that I was a little scared of the heat---it seemed like it would be pretty easy to accidentally burn yourself with these, although of course there were safety warnings and we followed them, but when you had to get the heating part close to the scalp, it was a little nervewracking.  Overall, this seemed like a quality product.  It was solidly made and looked nice, heated up quickly and had a good feel to it.  If you are like me and just want to smooth down hair, it might be great, or if you have more experience, you might do better than I did with super curly hair."
9336,"I Like It!_This shampoo has a nice smell, albeit a little too strong for me, but lathers very well and leaves my hair feeling clean, soft, and with great body.  The price is a little steep, but if this shampoo keeps performing this well down the road, then it will be worth the purchase price.  I would recommend."
6256,"Takes off all my make-up! Love this!_Each Christmas my girlfriends and I exchange &#34;our favorite things&#34; and this year, this is going to be one of &#34;my favorite things.&#34; It smells good and washes my face clean. I wear a lot of make up for work so this is great, it takes everything off without having to use different products for eyes, etc."
6930,Plates work beautifully_I bought these plates so I can do my own nails and they worked perfectly.  Not a complaint at all.  Just took a while to be able to use the stamper correctly.
5777,"The product sold here seems sketchy, but the real deal is wonderful_The real deal product - 4 to 5 stars.  The product being sold here, less than that because it seems suspect.I received a large sample of this from Sephora some time ago.  I used it several times and absolutely loved it.  I have dry, sensitive skin skin, but contrary to some of the reviews here, this product did not feel too harsh, nor did the exfoliants feel like they were skin-tearing.  After use, my skin felt so incredibly hydrated, even without the use of a moisturizer (that's a rarity for me).  It also felt smooth and silky soft.  It might be true that there are cheaper masks that are just as effective, but to be honest, I've not found a decent mud mask in a very long time.Now the product being marketed here, at least based on the photos, does not seem authentic.  I have only seen it sold at very specific places, so that alone raises a red flag.  But what I find more disturbing is that when you zoom in on the photos of the product, you can see that it's a poor imitation of the actual GlamGlow packaging.  There are errors in the writing - it is not smooth and you can see almost &#34;wavy&#34; lines, almost as though someone colored outside the lines. It's a poor stamp. The font and writing simply is not sharp and crisp as it is on the actual jar.  In addition, these photos show a plain black jar, but the authentic product has an almost granite look to it - black with grey or white spots throughout it (at least the one sold on Sephora looks that way).  It's entirely possible these are just poor photos, but they make me wary.In any event, I would be careful when buying this through a third party seller not authorized by the company to sell its product.  As this is not actually sold by Amazon, I would think this is a buyer beware situation."
7585,"grreatt_The brush set it cool and nicce,they work greatt on acrylic nails,and the best is that they dont cost a lot"
1960,"Very Pleased With This Clay_This clay is very good quality. The only thing I could find to complain about is that sometimes it is hard to mix without getting lumps. It does exactly what it says it will do, though. I used it to pull impurities out of the skin on my arms, and it left my skin soft and smooth. I also used it as a facial and was pleased with the results. Tried using it to condition my hair, but I didn't really see much difference, since I have very soft hair anyway. I took it internally without a bad reaction. All-in-all, I will continue to use this brand in the future."
9054,One Star_Not working with me...waist the money!
1679,Cute Color_I really like this shade of color and it adds simmer to my face without over doing it. I also like that it's a mousse instead of a powder so it doesn't have a blowout in my makeup bag.
4525,I love this product_It made my hair so soft and it straightened it a little bit. That was great because i have extremely thick and curly hair and this made it manageable afterwards. Will keep using this in conjuction with the silicon mix.
3673,"Good product_The shadows apply very easily, have a nice pigmentation and look really great. My favorite of these are the purple and emerald smokes as they make my brown eyes pop. These are my new favorite eye shadows my only complaint is that they don't have much of a staying power, so if you use these, be sure to prime before hand."
2404,"The great equalizer_I have never owned or used a product that I really thought deserved to be called Fool-proof. This Is It.I am hair disabled. I am so very bad at styling my own hair that some time ago I decided to cut my losses, and invest my energy in more productive pursuits. As such, I can build you a doghouse, but my hair will look like a bird's nest while I do it. This little gadget has changed my life. I know that sounds really hyperbolic, but it's true.I have very long hair and it's heavy, heavy. A pony tail is my only hair trick (pathetic) but within a half hour of wearing one the weight of it kills me! Enter the hair donut. All you have to do - no really - ALL YOU HAVE TO DO to have a deliberate hairstyle is:Put your hair in a pony tail.Put the donut around the pony tail.Move the donut as close to the loose end of your pony tail as possible.Take the hairs that poke through the donut hole and roll them over the edge of the donut.Holding the loose ends of hair against the donut's outer side, ROLL the donut down your pony tail toward your head.Once you get down to your head, tuck tuck tuck any loose pieces.Done.Holy buckets, I am not kidding you're done. You look great and not at all like a person who can't style their own hair at 33 years old. You might even get compliments.In fact, that is the only down-side to this little gem: people will want to know how you get your hair to look so pretty in that ballerina bun! Try your best to come up with a gracious Thank you. Do not let your jaw hit the floor because strangers who are being nice don't know how to work with that response. Trust me, just say Thanks. Say, It's really easy, get a donut!"
5573,"Get a sample first and then buy buy buy!_I got a 2 oz sample from myperfumesamples.com (International shipping too! Woohoo!)I loved this out of all the Kardashian perfumes on the market. It is definitely a Unisex scent tending towards more of a man's scent. (But it's gorgeous!!) It is not overpowering and lasts for lengthy periods during the day. It's a good day AND night scent. Only drawback is sometimes one may have is a whiff of wet dog if you've gone out for a workout and drenched in sweat. (I cycle to work for about 2 hours a day up hills,etc, so yes, sweat with this perfume doesn't smell as good! As one would expect!)I am currently in search of finding a good shower foam/gel which enhances well in combination with this perfume.Other scents I love are Armani Mania (White),Narciso Rodriguez For Her EDP, Idylle EDP by Guerlain (Summer Scent), Gucci's Gardenia and Jacob Classique (Canadian Scent - not Marc Jacobs), to name a few!Do try them especially if you like Unbreakable Bond..mmm."
5754,"Nice brushes for the money_Good quality fibers and well constructed. This brand has a nice weight and heft to the brush. Easily cleaned with water and a drop of shampoo. Brush fibers dry straight and don't frizz. I'm a hairdresser, and for the money this brand is a good deal. Applies makeup well, easy care, and bacteria resistant, and nice case for protection and hygiene. I recommend this set."
7889,"Beads leak color when applied, super unhappy._I was SO excited to use these inexpensive caviar beads! I waited weeks for them to arrive (before the estimated delivery date) and I quickly got to work experimenting. I intended to use them in combination with Gelish polish to give them a longer lasting look than the sephora brand method. As soon as i laid them into my gel polish they color started to melt away, it muddied the polish and the destroyed the look. I tried setting the beads in the sticky layer, color melted, i set the beads in a gelish polish layer, color melted, I set the beads quicker and top coated and cured, again melted.I also tried the beads with regular OPI polish with the same result. I guess i could try using them as a scrap book embellishment, but so far I have wasted a few bucks and multiple hours of my time trying to make this happen, If anybody finds a better way, please fill me in!"
4144,"love the color_used it on st pat and loved it. it is a true kelly green; does not photograph well as it looks jade on pict but it is kelly green. applied easy, great coverage. only comjplain and IT IS A BIG ONE is that it stained my nails green and had to bleach them to return to white!"
7958,"Not sure of what I'm really getting!!_When using this product, it worked okay, but the research that I have done on organic shea butter tells me that this product may not be actual African Shea Butter. This product may be just plain African Butter(kpangnan) that comes from a totally different tree, that grows in a totally different part of Africa, then where  African Shea butter would come from. Like I said in a earlier comment, it worked okay, but if I order African Shea Butter, that is what I expect to get. Future customers, please do your homework on this product, for if you are purchasing African Shea Butter, that is what you should received."
4174,love it!_I have this eye shadow kit and i love it! so many shadows to choose from! I love the metallic shimmer that are on the colors!! I love the case its in! so pretty!
313,Five Stars_Exceedingly refreshing!
7828,"Convenient for purse or travel case_As pictures can be deceiving, this is no exception. The description is accurate that it is 1 gram each. The item you are viewing/will be ordering is about the width of a half dollar or likened to the rectangular size of a small piece of gum (like Trident or Chicle). As a product review this item performs as it should--it is indeed waterproof, black, dries quickly, and is a firm adhesive when used correctly.Because of its size it is very convenient to carry in your purse or makeup kit when travelling. It is a molded plastic tube with a screw top wand. The screw top wand is a nice touch as it allows for more accurate application of glue to the false lash or touch up on the corners of your eyelids should the false lash come loose. When empty, you can put a drop of (Ardell, etc) black, waterproof glue to refill or merely reorder. The container can be re-purposed for a variety of cosmetic perishables (e.g. cuticle oil) after being cleaned with an alcohol saturated Qtip.When travelling with this item, make sure the screw top is completely closed and placed in a purse/luggage pocket that will ensure it will not be crushed as it could leak. Or place in a small ziploc bag for safe keeping/peace of mind.Do not expose to heat or sunlight, as this will affect performance of glue.I received this product a few days after ordering and in a full-size, bubble manila envelope. All intact."
8244,"Looks very good on, very pricey_Both my Mother and I used this Hydroxatone BB Cream for several days and overall, we both feel it's a decent product. For her it offered very smooth coverage and felt light on the skin. The medium color was good and did not give her that 'layer of foundation' look. It wore well all day and never looked or felt caked even with a bit of blush added. She said she'll buy it again. For me though.... it looked fine and did feel light and I like the added benefit of sunscreen since I spent several hours outside every day working with horses. My complaint was that this cream sweats off very easily - now that is not unique to this product - almost no make up survives a morning working with horses and the only sunscreens that really last are the waterproof ones meant to be used at the beach etc. I think for an afternoon at the zoo or something, this product is just fine. However I personally feel it's overpriced compared to other products out there. As to the anti-aging benefits? Who can say....most of those claims by any product are hokum and deep down, we all know it."
2383,Effective allergy free product_I have a sensitive skin around my eye and not able to use most eye cream. Most eye creams that I can use such as Olay regen eye serum provide good moisturizing but nothing else. I have found this eye does improve wrinkles around my eye and no allergy reaction. However it can only be used at night as it does cake under make up.
5354,Didn't work for me_This didn't make a difference in my makeup application or wear. It didn't give me the smooth base or staying power I was wanting. Would not buy again
5477,"A great find for the price_* This leave-in treatment worked well for my normal/dry, med-thick, med-length hair, I liked how my hair looked hydrated* I only put on the length of my hair and not near my scalp.* A great find for the price.  You can also by the oil and add to any conditioner or shampoo of your choice."
3375,"Made my acne worse!_I must be the exception because I haven't read anything about this happening to anyone else!I have used Proactive for the past couple of years and was getting low so decided to try Acne Free because its cheaper & has great reviews. I have used it for a little over a week and my face, neck, & chest (everywhere I was using it) started breaking out worse than ever!! I have very fair, sensitive skin which I why I got the Sensitive skin kind. I had read all of the great reviews and was convinced it would work :( After my skin started to get worse when I began using it, I searched all over the internet to see if maybe it was normal for your skin to break out before it got better but could not find any accounts of this happening from the use of Acne Free- PLUS the box says you will see results in 3 days- well, the only results I saw in 3 days were more pimples!!!!!! It could be that I am having an allergic reaction to on of the added ingredients, there's no way to tell but I am taking it back because it's obviously not going to work for me like it does for most!I am going to buy more Proactive today because I didnt realize how good I had it. Plus I am going to be more disciplined about using it morning & night because I know that makes all the difference. Sometimes you just have to pay more to get something that works for you.****On a good note***** I was very pleased with the fact that the face wash actually CLEANSED my face, no makeup removing cloths required which is unlike Proactive which requires that I remove makeup before using the face wash because it simply doesn't do the job :  an added expense!!!) They need to hurry up and make Proactive cheaper in my opinion! They've made enough money already!!!"
5677,"Awesome Flat Iron for Thin Hair!_I have very thin hair- Setting this flat iron to 300 is the perfect setting for my hair- It straightens within seconds... I really feel like it makes my hair soft, not frizzy and very easy to use!  The perfect straightener for my hair!"
7993,"Really Works_It was simple to use and it really works, I used one of my favorite perfumes. However, I am unsure of how to clean the perfume inside"
3985,smells awesome !!!_this lotion smells amazing it feels like your in a tropical island ...the tingle factor is well i didn't feel a thing but it gives you a great tan..
899,Wonderful_This has good a great scent to it.  Everyone also compliments me when I'm wearing it and I feel confident.
4263,"really works_just recently started using ROC products, finally something that actually works, I use this over ROC Max Wrinkle Resurfacing System"
3832,make my hair shine_Nice way to make flat hair shine again.  You will however need to remove it everyday to it get oily
1508,SMART MAKEUP IS PERFECT_I use Almay Smart Shade Makeup and love it. I love the way it becomes my own complexion color! It's wonderful!
8710,"great color!_This is such a nice color.  Very natural on your lids and up a bit.  And it lasts, just like it says.  Not sure about 24 hours because I never leave my makeup on that long.  It's not good for you.  Makes your eyes old looking after awhile, or so I've read."
4605,So Creative_These gemstones have gotten me so into doing my nails now. I love all the creative styles I can do now. The colors are awesome and the small sizes are great for nails. Bright colors and so many stones to last for a while. Luv Em!!!
9731,"Smells nice, leaves hair soft_This is an all in one shampoo.  It smells like oranges with a herbal note thrown in. It's very nice for men but it's not so masculine that a woman will hesitate to use it.  It's a natural scent.  It's not overly strong.The suds were loose and I had to use a good bit on my very long hair.  It felt nice and a bit cooling, from the tea tree oil and mint I think.It doesn't have sulfur/tar in it, the active ingredient is  Pyrithione zinc, which is effective for controlling dandruff.  I didn't have a bi of itch and that held for several days.It left my hair extra-shiny, clean, and soft root to tip, and did not weigh it down, though it did look and feel like it had been conditioned.  (I did have fly-aways everywhere, and could have benefited from some smoothing serum after using this, which is why I'm only giving it a 4.)I've been quite impressed with this brand overall.  They are making effective, affordable, everyday products."
2353,"Popular....send in the Paparazzi!!_This potion is amazing! I've had it for a few weeks now but I tested it over Easter weekend around my Step-Family. My step family has always included me in everything but once I'm around them, they rarely stay engaged in conversation with me. This time was completely different. They were so chatty and comfortable around me that they would not leave my side. I spoke to my Step Sister more on Easter day than in the 16 years that I have known her. Then, her brother in law would not leave my side. It was so wonderful to have them engaged in conversation that I think we have finally bonded. This will be my go to potion when I am around them. My Step Father even mentioned that he wasn't sure what happened but I was very Popular with him family on Easter. HAHA!!"
5882,"I've found my brand of mascara!_I am loyal to certain brands of makeup products like my foundation and lipstick but I've never found a mascara brand I was committed to.  However, I think Covergirl's NatureLuxe Mousse Mascara has changed that.  It is very light and my eyelashes aren't stiff and unnatural looking.  It doesn't flake throughout the day and looks as good at the end of the day as it did in the beginning.  The applicator is not made out of the typical brush materials and is designed to keep my lashes separated so they don't clump together during application.  In addition to the lift that NatureLuxe Mousse Mascara already provides, it really holds the curl from my eyelash curler.  The only negative is that it doesn't dry as fast as most mascaras so I need to wait a little while before I curl. It comes off easily with my Neutrogena makeup removal wipes.  I love it!"
6094,Love it!_It works just like its suppose to.
8769,"Care for Your Hair_Used to be a hair product junkie.  Have tried the high end (salon brands) to the lowest of low and have found that Dove's products consistently are very high quality for the price.  My only real issue with Dove has been some of their older products were over scented.  Love fragrance, but there's a point where it becomes annoying.  That said, this Leave On Conditioner has a mild fragrance and smells like coconut.My recommendation is to apply this to your hair while its still fairly wet.  It's easier to detangle that way, especially if you haven't already used a conditioner while you were in the shower.  Applied say a nickel sized amount - my hair is fine but thick and below the shoulders.  This product pleasantly surprised me.  Stuff is totally lightweight and definitely changed the texture of my hair, making it smoother and manageable.  As for the ingredients there is silicone and mineral oil, which some may object to.  Also coconut oil, which is fantastic for your hair.My hair, while dry, gets poop out on the day after shampooing/conditioning. Can look dirty and limp.  It didn't!  But, the real test was in the following days.  Here I am on DAY TWO after shampooing, and my hair looks still clean and not weighed down at all.Does your hair get the droops?  Here's a very cheap and quick tip to remedy hair droop:  sprinkle a little baking soda into your hand.  Fling your head over, and drag said hand through your scalp and give it a little rub to distribute.  Flip head back and comb out.  Voila!"
698,"Great... But Needs Improvement_My hair has some natural wave, is fine in diameter and texture, but I have a lot of it.Ever since I got a 1920's-style bob, having to blow dry and then flat iron my hair became tedious and annoying whenever I was pressed for time.To make things faster and easier, I bought theConair BC171CS Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush, Black, 1.25 Inch. Did it work for my hair type and hair style? Yes.However, there is a lot of room for improvement:1. The switch everyone mentions. Yes, it is a pain.2. The air brush could use a medium heat setting. With the low setting, it takes a long time for my hair to become dry. With the high setting, I have to be careful I do not fry my hair.3. It could use a cool setting. Not mandatory, but it would be nice to have.4. A hanging loop.I suspect for people with very full and thick hair, this air brush would would take a good amount of time to get their hair dry. Also, for people with very curly or wavy hair, this device will not straighten your hair without a smoothing hair product. I strongly suspect that for people with straight hair who are looking for lots of curls and ringlets, this may not work as well as a curling iron or hot rollers.For myself, it has worked incredibly well... it just needs some tweaks to make it perfect."
2709,"Nectarine Dove body wash_There is nothng better in the winter than to bathe in a warm delicious fragrant body wash!!  The Dove Burst Body wash from Amazon is especially nice with the tangerine scent and the delicious way it makes your skin feel after a shower or wash in the tub.  Your skin will feel as if you have already moisturized it after using Dove!  The fragrance lingers on your skin as you dry and slip into clothes.  I got my Dove go Fresh from Amazon and you will find it at great price and fast shipping.  Let your skin feel delicious this winter.Dove go fresh, Burst Body Wash, 24 Ounce (Pack of 2)"
4941,"There are a lot of things I buy generic or store brand..._...but never, never Q-Tips.  I have never found  a drugstore or alternative brand that has the same padding, the same stick strength, the same usefulness.  Since I don't like poking myself with sharp sticks, I stick with OEM Q-Tips, always."
3137,"Spend more and buy the salon brands instead_I wanted to love this. The smell is divine and the first tube of this worked just fine. Afterwards, it didn't seem to work as well and feels like it actually started drying my hair out. I have color treated, long hair with mostly lowlights and some highlights. I have thick, wavy hair. I bought this trying to replicate the Pureology from my salon which is about $25/tube compared to Loreal's $6/tube."
6530,"Must have,beautiful !!!_This is insane, love love love this!! I would soooo buy this again in a heartbeat !! Beautiful colors! I will be buying shany makeup again."
8149,Favorite fall color last year._I adore navy blue and this has sparkle and shimmer so it is perfect.  If sparkle were a color I would buy it....again I love this color.
9289,"Comfortable - has enough gel_This review is from: BelleSha Spa Moisturizing Gel Socks (Misc.)In the product photo these almost look like hospital socks with the no-skin bumps. But they're thick, relatively heavy and with volume. There is gel to cushion the feet.These were made to use with lotion to smooth out one's feet, perhaps on the heel. They're breathable so it's possible. My wife likes them. Product provided by BelleSha."
8788,"OK lamp_This lamp does the job, cures my hard gel and gel polish just fine. It's roomy enough for my big hands and it packs away nicely.I just wish I could turn off the damn beeping."
77,"exactly what i wanted!!!_I've has this lipstick for such a long time, and you cant find it in stores anymore :(. I don't use this by itself, I use it for a perfect ombre lip. I take any lip liner and outline my lips, and hen fill in the sides. Then I take this lipstick and put it on the center of my pout. Then I smush them together, and I have a nicely faded ombre lip. I get compliments every time. I have found that my ombre lip works BESTEST ;) with this lipstick. I've tried it with mac ones and its never as good! This lipstick is a staple in  my collection. Very quick shipping !"
1083,"No more salon visits to blow dry my hair straight.....SEDU ONLY!!!_I was always skeptical about these flat irons, purchased a couple in the past years, didnt work. Someone recommended this one...told me to make sure I buy the 'SEDU' Brand only. My hair is naturally super wavy, thick, and long. I pay alot at the hair salon just to blow dry it straight, not to mention all that pulling hair they do. After trying this...WOW!!! I love it. I can straighten my hair super fast and it leaves it shiny. I get compliments all the time. This doesn't burn my hair, leaves it healhty looking. I soooo recommend this flat iron, NO OTHER WORKS THE SAME. It was costing me alot to have my hair professionally straighten at the salon, this is worth every penny!!!"
4882,"On the go, its magic._I used this product when on the go and it is life save. It does make pimple disappear faster. Easy to apply and easy to use."
4835,"Love it!_Love the color, works great and stayed on 2-3 weeks. Didn't need to use a full amount of time under the UV light since it's not too dark."
5819,"Five Stars_Great price, bought as a gift and she loves them!"
1605,"It works._The intensive therapy polish really improved my nails, they don`t chip and got stronger. The minus is that it doesn`t stay on for days, more for a day only, especially if you work with your hands (f.e. cleaning house-I have a diamond coat for polish that stays on no matter what for a few days).The dryer is useless for me, did not made my nails dry faster. But I bought this set for the first item, to improve my nails after removing acrylics. I highly recommend Nail Tek Intensive Therapy II."
3398,"My crocodile skin feels great!_I have incredibly dry, itchy skin - particularly in the winter. Between the lower humidity in the air and the heat running more, my skin begins to look like I have a four-legged reptilian ancestor. I had read about this new lotion and was very curious about how well it might work, so I jumped at the chance to give it a try.I have been using the lotion for about 2 weeks now - certainly a fair amount of time, particularly since it often seems to take at least a week for my skin to really settle into a new lotion. I use it once a day - in the evening, after my shower. It has no greasy feel, and absorbs quite well. Without needing to reapply during the day, my skin stays soft and hydrated - no itchy spots or reptile skin. No dry patches or irritation.The only issue I have with the lotion (and it could very well just be this particular 'flavor' - I haven't tried any others) is that the scent is initially fairly strong. Not to the point of making me sick to my stomach (and many overpowering scents can do that), but just...overwhelmingly *there*. It's very similar to when you initially put on perfume - it initially smells strong, but fades nicely over time.Overall, I highly recommend this lotion. It has worked incredibly well on my poor skin, and it's thick or greasy like many others. I fully intend to buy another bottle once this one has been completely used up."
5279,highly effective in eliminating blackheads_I used rose water to make a paste and put it on my face to remove blackheads the other day. After a few minutes I felt my face was tighter and also felt increased blood circulation. This one time application removed blackheads and my skin felt so supple. Increadible product
3977,One of my favorite Bdelllium brushes._I absolutely love this brush. I use it for application of BB cream and pigmented blushes. I find the stippling effect beautiful. The brush is perfection!!! Buy it!
1154,unreal_The best exfoliating gloves ever!I use them once a week and after my shower my skin feels 10 years younger!so silky soft and smooth
1828,Good relaxer_This is a nice mild relaxer that help to keep the hair healthier. It does not relax the hair to a bone straight texture. I've been using it for a couple of years and can't imagine using anything else. I have much healthier hair than I did when I used Affirm.
1021,"Absolutely no complaints, better than i expected._it shipped fast, and was as promised.  i love that it's lightweight and can dry my thick, curly, long hair in about 10 mins (which is about 20 mins faster than my last blow dryer) without causing frizzies (when using the diffuser, which was included, along with a concentrator) or my arms needing a break.  the only time i've had my hair dried faster was at Gene Juarez with what i'm assuming is much more expensive equipment.  for under $30 i can live with the toggle buttons where they are.  i turned it off once by accident, and just repositioned my hand after that and it was not an issue."
6535,i needed this!_i was recently looking for a really good 180 color palette and when i found this one i was soo excited to try it! there are soo many varieties of colors and i feel like with this palette i won't ever have to worry about running out of options.
1043,I swear by this!_I swear by this stuff.  Use it nearly every night.  I had a friend I hadn't seen in a year come to visit me.  We have been friends since 1999.  I am in my mid-thirties.  She told me I have never looked younger & my skin has never looked so nice.  I told her what I was using.  This stuff in not expensive & it works.  You can feel a difference in your skin overnight.  This is better than the expensive stuff you buy in department stores or online.  Lasts a very long time.
9306,"complex, confusing, does it work(?), just a 'process'_So, not sure if I read the description wrong, or if I just didn&#8217;t understand what this product actually IS, but I&#8217;ve NOT been enjoying it and have found it WAAAAY more complex, complicated, and almost more work than it seems to be worth the effort since it is so much more of a &#8220;process&#8221; than anything. I honestly thought this would be something &#8220;similar&#8221; to a kind of shampoo, or some other kind of special &#8216;cream&#8217; or mixture that was more for the whole head (to stimulate growth and help with thickness of hair/hair that has slowed down or stopped growing). Boy was I mistaken.Now, normally, I&#8217;m like a great majority when it comes to directions: I don&#8217;t often read them. Well, since this is such a &#8220;new&#8221; product for me &#8211; one that I&#8217;ve never seen on the shelves or experienced using myself &#8211; I figured it&#8217;d be wise to read the directions. Let&#8217;s just say, that while the directions are understandable, they are SUPER confusing. This is the gist of what [I remember] them saying: &#8216;Don&#8217;t use if you know the reason of your hair loss or if you do know the reason. Be warned to make sure that it doesn&#8217;t get on any other part of your skin (other than scalp) or you may risk hair growth. Be careful when using. Consult your doctor before using to see what the cause of hair loss might be,&#8217;&#8230;a bit contradictory in several places. But the actual APPLICATION turned out to be even more complex than I anticipated.According to the directions, it provides a few pictures (three or four, can&#8217;t remember & don&#8217;t have the box with/near me currently) and the pictures show &#8220;acceptable hair loss&#8221; &#8211; or, &#8216;if your hair looks like this, you can use it,&#8217; of which there are two or three examples, and then the last example being of what it looks like when one should not use it. Honestly: all of the pictures look like the gal just did her part &#8220;down the middle,&#8221; with a different width of the &#8220;gap&#8221; for the part.For me, my hair loss is NOT that obvious. I have a thinning part, yes, but I also have areas of actual hair loss, HOWEVER, I am fairly fortunate considering that I have enough hair &#8211; that is both long and thick enough &#8211; to cover these places. When I lift up these locks of hair, though, they are clearly more distinct. Sadly, my impression from the directions is that (for my condition) it may not work/it doesn&#8217;t seem/appear to be an &#8220;acceptable&#8221; state for this solution&#8230;.not to mention that in the directions, it talks about dropping it on one drop at a time for &#8220;most effective results&#8221; &#8211; or something to that effect(????) What?!?!? (I don&#8217;t understand that.) Granted, I can understand if they mean to encourage people to apply it slowly so that it doesn&#8217;t squirt/drip everywhere, but why not just say, &#8220;Apply with dropper slowly,&#8221; and leave it at that (more or less, for lack of a better term).Regarding application: WAY. TOO. CHALLENGING.Yes: that is what it&#8217;s turning out to be: a challenge. Not some &#8220;easy process&#8221; or a simple kind of &#8220;measure-and-apply.&#8221; Maybe because of where my thinning/needs-more-hair growth areas are, but the first week &#8211; or two &#8211; was the. HARDEST. Not that it&#8217;s any easier &#8211; about a month later &#8211; but the directions say that your hair should be dry (or as dry as you can) &#8211; [very inconvenient if you ask me&#8230;just makes things more complicated, whether you put it on in the morning or evening] &#8211; one is supposed to wait so many hours before (and/or after) applying solution to wet hair or&#8230;.whatever else, I can&#8217;t remember but it makes applying it and living (i.e. bathing and keeping clean) VERY. very. INVCONVENIENT. Whether one showers in the morning or evening, they essentially would have to wait several hours before applying, or apply it and wait several hours to apply &#8211; which, to my understanding &#8211; does NOT suit a &#8216;typical&#8217; American workday, or even just ANY kind of day. I&#8217;ve found it VERY difficult and quite inconvenient at times to use, but, since I&#8217;ve already have in my possession the three-month supply, I&#8217;m just going to use it up. If it helps some: great. If not, well&#8230;tough beans for me, I guess. Oh! That brings me to another point: how long to use and how often to use.The directions say that for &#8220;optimal effect,&#8221; in essence, one should use it TWICE a day &#8211; hence my reference to the twice-a-day use previously. That is one of the reasons why it is/can be so inconvenient&#8230;.understandably, one doesn&#8217;t HAVE to use it twice a day, but I&#8217;d like to think that using it as recommended would prove beneficial/helpful. In any case, the only &#8220;easy&#8221; part about the whole process &#8211; which, I don&#8217;t appreciate how it&#8217;s ended up becoming&#8230;a process&#8230;just to apply a little solution &#8211; is that the dropper is not quite hard to get to the &#8216;1 mL&#8217; line that is (thankfully) VERY clearly marked on the dropper. Moving on from how often to how long, the directions/description was saying something like &#8216;It could take up to 6 to 8 months before noticing any effects&#8230;&#8217; Seriously? Like, there shouldn&#8217;t be ANY growth of ANY KIND before that? From my non-hairstylist-professional background and understanding, hair &#8211; in general &#8211; GROWS (without the aid of any solution of any kind) EVERY month, and one typically notices/can notice SOME kind of growth within 2 &#8211; 3 months&#8230;.and yet, this solution says wait 6 &#8211; 8 months (or so) to see ****IF***** there is any growth/noticeable growth/re-growth, etc. (??!!??) That just seems like a way for the company to get people to buy their product. What if it DOESN&#8217;T work? Then those individuals just wasted all of that money &#8211; time, energy, and effort no doubt &#8211; on a product that may/may not work (and, in some cases, doesn&#8217;t even end up working)&#8230;.As &#8220;successful&#8221; as this product seems to claim itself, I just hesitate and would STRONGLY caution consumers to use this product, for, it just seems like [literally] a shot in the dark as to weather or not the solution would help that particular individual&#8230;.almost like playing a kind of hair re-growth &#8220;Russian Roulette&#8221; with this hair product. :/ I haven&#8217;t been too terribly impressed thus far with the product, or rather, the issues concerning the actual implementation of the actual use of the product. Unless/until I can see an easier method and/or see ANY kind of remote effectiveness from this product, I see no reason (for me, personally and my experience thus far) to like it."
4822,great color_great color to cover undereye circles... nice smooth consistency.. could be a bit creamier... tends to be just slightly dry.
1285,"Love for a conservative but still fun look_I change my toe and finger polish colors almost every week or sometimes two weeks, usingNew!! Cnd Nail Stickey Base Coat 0.33 OzandSeche Vite Dry Fast Top Coatto make it pop and really last.This is a great color for those times when I want to look a little more traditional and girly (considering my favorite colors are usually OPI Mod About Brights the It Color B66,Borghese Nail Lacquer B260 Positano Petal, andOPI What's with the Cattitude Nail Polish - NLB90).  It's a great deep burgundy, and lasts for an incredibly long time.  Looks very ladylike and modern with a nicer suit and especially with gray dresses and sweaters for the fall.One of the things I especially like about this color is that there is NOT a sparkle to it.  I really also likeOPI Eiffel For This Color, but it's a little too sparkly for me.  I just happen to prefer matte colors without that car-finish look to them.  So this is my preference most times when I reach for a dark color.One suggestion is to getOPI Correct & Clean Up Refillable Corrector Penfor this dark of a color - mistakes are super, duper obvious.This polish will actually last up to two weeks if you use Stickey base coat and the Seche top coat, and stays looking great.  Buy it and wear it."
3234,"very nice_defines the eye beautifully- clear- sharpand rich color.. it's a very good one, worth buying and the shadow is good too"
1148,"they work_they did take all that nasty stuff and my nose looked more clear and clean, so I was happy, I just wish they were more cheaper, still clear face and cleaner is better."
3520,"Monroe Teasing U Brush_I flinched a bit at the price (I'm not a big spender when it comes to hair) but it was so worth it.  I adore this brush.  Because it works so well, I can tease my whole crown in no time--only takes a few strokes per piece, and the pointed bottom is nice for quickly separating sections.  I've had mine for about a year, and it's held up beautifully.  Highly recommended!"
9013,"awesome_I have several of these.  I use two for lipsticks, one for mascara and eyeliner, and one for eyeshadow sticks.  These things really gave me my dresser back."
2088,"Works more like a primer for me._This product definitely helps soften the vertical lines between my brows and also conceals enlarged pores without clogging them. While it comes in a small one ounce tube, a little goes a long way. I've been using the same tube for several months. There is no perfumy scent (I do not detect any scent at all) and it leaves a nice matte finish.I've had no problems applying a light tinted moisturizer over it (none of the flaking that others have mentioned). I think this may happen when too much product is applied. Sometimes I don't even use a foundation at all because this leaves such a nice smooth finish. It seems to function in the same way as a foundation primer, however, it works better for me than the many primers I've tried. My only wish is that the formula contained some active treatment benefit versus just 'filling and sealing.' Despite this, I do appreciate the temporary concealing properties of this product and I will re-purchase it to serve as my primer."
7338,I Love It_OPI Nail Lacquer Limited Edition New York City Ballet Collection is wonderful.  You can never go wrong with OPI products they are the best.  This color is very elegant and beauiful.
396,"Not impressed!!!_I used this on some older stretch marks that I had and it did nothing for them. It is a great moisturizer, but way too expensive to use for that.  I ended up buying 100% unrefined shea butter and noticed a significant improvement in my older stretch marks and it moisturizes my skin all day from just one application.  Makes a great all over body moisturizer and you can even use it in your hair.  The unrefined shea butter is way cheaper and way more effective.  I would suggest buying the unrefined shea butter instead."
2210,"Heard GREAT things about help with drying time._I upped my review to 5 stars. Run, don't walk, to order this if you're in the market for a brilliant fast drying shiny top coat.  I've now tried it while waiting to receive my order.  By the way, I payed twice the price at WalMart.  That's right!  And I've tried several Dollar Tree stores.  I 'heard' it could be purchased there.  Apparently not.I originally wrote:This stuff gets raves on beauty forums.  The down side is you can get it at the Dollar Tree for a buck.  I'm willing to pay more to try it for the first time.  The stars are for price alone.  I'll upgrade and review thoroughly if it indeed works as claimed by several beauty gurus. (:"
9653,Worth the money!_This hair piece is well worth the $5. It is very easy to clip in and it stays in place pretty well. The hair is very soft and silky. It does get a little tangled but a quick brush through and it looks great. It doesn't shed too bad either. It is a little heavy...but maybe because I'm so used to my thin hair. I will definitely purchase again.
5510,"Didn't work for my 4c hair..._I felt like it coated my hair in like a black crumbly material, which did not actually dye my hair and flaked off. I might have done something wrong, but I know i followed the instructions to the T. I plan to use Bigen dye to get my hair black."
7071,"Smooth and Soft_Smelled great and did awesome things for my hair, like made it smoother and softer. Really liked this shampoo and when I get the money, I'll order some more!"
6071,ice_This product is really nice.  It is really good for keeping your hair shiny and straight for a longer period of time.
4566,"Pretty cool_I put on 3 coats and it does sparkle, but I didn't see prisms. I could sort of see it in the sunlight, but it was a slight rainbow effect. I would probably buy some other colors, but I am not as impressed and I thought I was going to be."
8995,"husband loves it!_I am blessed with fairly good skin so I rarely use masks but my husband works out side all year round and has always had problematic skin and uses facial masks and cleansers on a regular bases. That being said I used the product and enjoyed it and my skin felt very nice smooth and clean after use, My husband who has tried just about every mask out there mud peel warming... etc... loved this mask. He said the warming tingle and the eucalyptus smell was very nice and relaxing.The feel of the mask is a bit goopy when you place your fingers in it to scoop out but not anything more then what you would expect when sticking your hand into &#34;MUD&#34; but it goes on nicely on the face. there is no sliding or moving and the tingling and warmth starts immediately. as the mask dries you can feel the tightening and the pull of the mud on your face.After wiping my husbands face clean of the mud mask I noticed that his face looked cleaner and clearer then any other mask has left him.I am impressed!"
390,"This is the best drying iron I have ever owned_I have had several of these of different brands, styles, features and prices and this one is by far the best. I owned one of these years ago and used it for years until it finally gave out. I replaced that one with a different brand. And then another and another but never got the same results. None of them ever had enough power to actually dry my hair. All of them touted fancy features and promised amazing results in the most easy to use design but they all ended up in my junk drawer.This one has 1200 watts of power. That's as much as a blow dryer because that's how much you need to dry your hair! If I wanted to use two appliances to dry and style my hair I'd blow dry it and then use a curling iron or flat iron. The whole point of these things is to take out the extra step and make it all happen in one. If a blow iron can't dry your hair you might as well be using a curling iron instead.But this one actually DOES do both. I just placed my order for this one and can't wait to get it. It's the exact same one I used to own and love except for the color.The only issue I had with my previous one was the seam in the plastic where the brush head connected to the base used to snag my hair out from time to time but I was able to fix that issue with a simple hair tie wrapped around to cover the seam.If you have thick, curly, frizzy, stubborn, resistant or even soft fine delicate hair, I highly recommend this styler. It's powerful enough for the toughest hair but with different heat settings it can be gentle enough for the most delicate baby hair. Use to fully dry and style or just to touch up, smooth and add extra body. Your hair will love it."
9817,"works well_I have a generic face device and wasn't certain this brush would fit, but it does and works very well. I like the firmness of the bristles, not too hard but very firm to clean well.  My skin feels clean and fresh. Exfoliates very well. The massaging action makes my skin glow. Good customer service.  The seller backs this product with a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee so no risk to try it."
5302,Works._Love it but expected a tiny bit more from the product.  But you can't go wrong it does work at least for me.
9198,"Too Dark_The color of this is too dark, and I actually have fairly dark hair (except for the gray!)  I also hadn't tried a powder/brush-type of cover before. I think I like the spray-ons better.  They don't color the skin as much, especially if you don't spray too much in one spot."
243,"Truly static free_I have naturally curly hair, so I don't often brush my hair during the day, but after a small mist I can re-comb through my hair with this brush and not have everything start flying up.  As a note, even with a small mist of water or even anti-static hair spray other brushes would still cause static and flyaways."
2009,"Lasts well, great price_I purchased this for a really good price.  It does not chip as quickly as most nail enamel.  I like it a lot.  The black is nice, like a sheer/solid black."
2191,Shaping Balm does not do it_The short sexy hair quick change shaping balm did not do anything for me.  I couldn't recommend to anyone else.
6038,"Wow Where Have You Been All My Life!_Wow Where Have You Been All My Life! This stuff is amazing! I have tiny little eyelashes curtesy of my genes. I have used;  Fake lashes &#8211; take forever, don&#8217;t look real, fall off and get sticky glue all over your eyes -  Lash Extensions &#8211; Cost a fortune, take well over two hours to complete, can&#8217;t wash, rub or touch eyes, fall out in two weeks - Every Mascara out there and nothing works as well as this product! Here is my regimen:1. Heat an eyelash curler with a blow dryer or hot water. Hold in hand to cool.2. Apply lash curler at base of lashes for 7-10 sec3. Coat top tips of lashes with a wet lengthening mascara4. Hold napkin, paper towel or toilet paper under eye and apply Lash Extender to tips for length or if you want fullness apply first coat of mascara all over lashes and then apply Lash Extender evenly over lashes5. Let dry for about a minute6. Apply second coat of mascara, gently wiggling the wand through lashes to separate.7. Take a look at your beautiful, long, red carpet ready lashes!"
6023,"Highly Recommended!_Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion SPF 15After using Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion SPF 15, once a day, for over two weeks, a few observations:* a silky-smooth lotion that smooths easily over face and throat area.* feels lightweight on skin with no tacky residue left behind.*  Am able to wear Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion SPF 15 under light make-up with no problems.  I don't wear heavy make-up, so could not say what it will do, in that respect.* no scent was detected.* skin does not feel, or look, greasy after wearing Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion SPF 15 all day.It may be my imagination, but it seems that the redness (across the bridge of my nose) from constantly wearing sunglasses has diminished to the point of non existence -- and perhaps a few minute spider veins that I could see on my face with the help of a 10x mirror, before, are no longer there.  hmmmm.  *Off to order a couple of more bottles of Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion SPF 15* 'nuf said.  :) Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2012"
5685,"Amazing!_This is probably the best face wash I have used to date. I am a product whore, in that I never use the same product for too long. This will be my second bottle and I am still in love! I don't want to jinx it, but I think this one and I are going for the long haul. I have acne prone skin and this wash (used with a Clarisonic) has really improved the quality of my complexion. My pores seem smaller and my face is smoother overall. I also notice that it is less oily. This wash is very moisturizing. I would recommend it to anyone."
2845,"quite good_Love this stuff. It goes on easy, sinks in fast, doesn't smell awful like so many do, and this package size is perfect to keep in the car or your computer bag."
8176,"Wow!  Great Color:)_Nice and smooth when you apply. Lots of color and people will stare as the color brings out your beautiful face. I need all the help I can get. Buy this, and more, since you don't ever want to run out."
8868,"I'm too uncoordinated for this..._It looked easy in the instructions, but I had the most difficult time getting my hair to stay wound around this wand-style curling iron. The portions of my hair kept sliding off. When I tried to gingerly hold my hair in place, I could almost feel the skin on my fingers sizzle (the glove that comes for protection didn't do the job for me).The iron itself seems well-made for a no-frills curling tool, but I much prefer the clip-on type."
2781,"Look your best_I bought this for my wife and she has been very happy with the product.She told me that the product is easy to apply. She likes the smooth and silky texture that blends with her skin tone; today, she does not leave the house without one to two applications a day.The only downside is that now she insists on taking a minute or two to apply the product before I take a photograph of her, telling me that she wants to look her best for the picture!"
9350,Silky Smooth - and makes your skin feel that way too!_I've been using this for a month.  After having reactions from over the counter brands - I decided to go natural and am so glad I did  Honestly my skin feels and looks smooth and soft.  Love it.
9797,"restored my natural beauty_I have been using this in combination with their Moroccan Rose Water, my skin has never looked better. I am definately keeping this in my daily routine because I refuse to go back to the way my face / skin looked before."
1291,"The only mascara that works on my oily eyes!_I have extremely oily and hooded eyelids, and I can't tell you how many &#34;smudge-proof&#34; mascaras I've tried unsuccessfully.  At the end of the day, I always had raccoon eyes.  No matter what.That all ended the day I tried Blinc. Seriously, not a SINGLE smudge.  EVER.  It's been a makeup miracle for me.The only tricky part is getting it off.  It comes off easily with water, but doesn't rub off like typical mascaras.  It comes off in &#34;chunks&#34; or &#34;tubes&#34; as others have described.  Not a big deal, just make sure you don't get any in your eye during removal."
5143,"If only they were cheaper..._I thought they would be super amazing but their more like pretty good. I do like them for my face but it does burn my eye area. Overall however, I love how you don't have to worry about them drying out since you wet them as needed. For the price I'd only buy them on sale though."
6178,"Amazing product !_It's my first time in buying such a huge collection of eyeshadows in one palette &#128525; I was so excited to use it and I'm super happy with it ... the only negative point is that I've received the palette with 4 damaged colors :( but overall I loved it so much , it deserves to earn 4 stars inspite of the inaccurate packaging!"
6961,"It really works!_I had tried everything to get rid of my greasy, smelly scalp. Not sure if my problems are are a result of menopause and hormone changes. At any rate, after a couple of uses, I noticed a huge difference in my scalp and I can even miss a day of shampooing now without a problem. I've been using it for about 2 weeks. I would highly recommend this shampoo."
3038,Best lip brush I've ever had_The retractable tip of this brush is really handy.  It keeps the brush in good shape and allows you to carry it in a purse or overnight bag with much fuss.
2661,"A unique nail polish color_I originally saw this on a friend's nails and immediately knew I had to buy it. This is one of the most unique nail polish colors I have encountered in a long time; it's like a mix between gray, brown, and purple - it's absolutely gorgeous."
1733,"Excellent_This is a really effective, gentle moisturizer. I get very dry skin in the winter and so far, this is a HUGE help, even after I use acne medicine that dries me out even worse. It's also got a great smell! It absorbs fairly quickly and doesn't make my skin feel greasy or coated in anything."
6617,"cumbersome design_When I took this out of the box I thought it looked more like a sump pump.It has many attachments and is bright blue.I was intimidated by it's size,and where to store it. The cutter is paired with a suction that somehow causes an uneven cutting or trim job.I have read here that it has been dangerous to use on humans because of the suction strength.I had to take heed as it is humans I wanted to use it on ,not pets!I have to say,this product sucks too much!"
4547,"Perfection in a water bottle - finally!_This is the first water bottle I've purchased that didn't break within months of minimal use.  I love it!  It shoots super far (8-10 feet?) with a thin/direct spray which is what I wanted.  This is not for hairstylists or anyone wanting a fine mist.  I also love the small size of the bottle as it doesn't take up a lot counter space as I leave it out all the time for ease of use.  We found that a few squirts to our hyper-barking dogs, (who bark at the wind, the trees, squirrels...basically everything), helps to calm them down. I also like that the inner tube/straw reaches to the very bottom so you get to use all of the water, not just most of the water.  Overall, it feels solidly constructed and for under $5, it's a slam-dunk for this family."
9444,"Pretty good!_As the first BB cream I tried for my body, I liked it!  I hadn't used jergens products in a long time, and I was definitely skeptical.  But after a while of use, I did notice a change in my skin ton!  It has a nice fragrance, and goes on smooth.  It also helps to brighten the skin, which can sometimes look dull, especially after the long winter we've had.The only thing though, is that it goes pretty fast.  It's not a very big tube for body lotion, and it's expensive, so if it becomes a regular product to use, it'll be relatively costly.  For that reason alone, I'll probably look for other alternatives before I come back to this product."
9094,"ISA Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron Hair Straightener - Worked very well for my daughter and for me_This ceramic hair straightener works. Period. It heated up quickly to a temperature that was perfect for our daughter's use, and I even had to adjust it down a bit for myself. This flat iron is easy to hold and easy to use, and performed the job very well. Yes, the placement of the digital controls is a design-issue that needs a rethink, but the unit has a work-around that works. If you are looking for a hair straightener then I can recommend this one.This unit heated up very quickly for me, in just a matter of seconds it was ready for use. 30 seconds tops.  My hair is thin so I actually had to turn the heat down to 180 degrees, and that worked perfectly. The weight and balance are just right, and the unit is comfortable to hold and use.As mentioned, the digital control buttons are placed in the perfectly wrong place and are always tweaked by my hand and fingers, but the unit's work-around actually works: Once the flat iron heats up to the desired temperature, double clicking the power button will lock the controls to disable the buttons so you do not accidentally change the temperature. I found that this worked well, though the buttons still kept beeping at me every time I touched them. When done, I double clicked the power button to remove the button lock, then then clicked it once again to turn the power off. A bit complex, but it really did work.If you would like to see pictures of the flat iron we received, please navigate to it's main sales page and then scroll down to where the 'Most Helpful Customer Reviews' section starts -- look to the right of that area for the 'Product Images From Customers' section, and our pictures are there. It is a nice looking unit that feels good in the hand.The documentation notes that this item includes a two year warranty, so if an issue arises within that time period I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this hair straightener gratis from the manufacturer and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.If you are looking for flat iron hair straightener of this size, style and design, for use similar to what I have described above, and can put up with a little design quirk that really does not hamper operation, then I absolutely recommend this unit based on my experience with it.Go for it."
8723,"12 year old loves it_I have to say, Amazon's packaging was not the best.  They simply threw the bottle into a bubble mailer and it arrived with nearly 1/4 of the contents no longer in the bottle.  But I can't fault the product for that - it's merely a notice to buyers.I found this gel to work as intended.  It cleans, doesn't dry out the skin and it leaves a fragrance - a long-lasting fragrance, actually.My 12 year old son thinks it's awesome (or sick, as they say around here - that's a good thing) and from the aura of fragrance around him when he exits the shower, I can tell he's actually washing himself thoroughly.  I'm impressed!"
629,"a great, cleansing shampoo..._The results I had with this shampoo were so effective, that I felt that it was worthy of a review (yes, I know I write a lot of them, but I take it very seriously). The recommendation is that you use Neutrogena Shampoo Anti-Residue, every week, to clear out the gunk left over from previous shampoos and conditioners. Though, the smell is a little on the strong side, I know it gets the job done. Use it, as needed, to provide excellent results, in between the times you use your everyday shampoo and conditioner combination."
1549,use just a drop for shiny hair_my daughter loves it -  she uses it daily - makes her hair shiny - she loves the smell and get compliments on the smell as though it was perfume -
2499,"Works great_This is such a power packed product at such a low cost.  And you can really trust this brand.  It got rid of the dry krapy skin on my neck and leaves a nice healthy looking tint, like a slight self tanner."
4869,"Gorgeoussss_For as low cost as this palette is, it.is.awesome. I am really impressed with the pigmentation and seriously just how gorgeous the colors are.The box arrived in layers of bubble wrap and not a single shadow was cracked, SO happy about that.The only fall backs are 1. I don't really see any matte shadows and 2. The clasp on the package itself is a bit sticky tho could just be mine. Neither is a big deal to me."
6354,"I need my cleanser to clean_I love Eminence products&#8230;except for this one. May face actually did not feel clean after using it. It's a cream cleanser so it doesn't foam, which is fine, but it also felt like it didn't wash off. As though I washed my face with lotion. I really wanted to like it, but I just couldn't. Maybe if my skin were much more dry or something. As it is, this just didn't work well for me."
5704,Nice_it gives a nice shear coat which works good for a job you have that will not allow bright colors
1367,"This is the only growth polish that works for me_My nails are thin and they crack easily. Not only that, but I wash dishes and wash my hands so often, the water often makes them worse. However, I've found my little miracle when it comes to healthy nails. I've tried every other green tea nail polish out there, and every polish that claims it will make your nails grow... And Sally Hansen's Maximum Growth is the only one that's actually done what they say  it will do. I redo my nails about every two weeks, and I always - ALWAYS - use one coat of this as a base coat and then proceed with whatever design I plan to do. This would have been my fourth bottle, if I didn't receive it broken in the mail. Amazon promptly refunded me though. But that will not stop me from purchasing it. I just need to buy it at the store like I've been doing."
5392,"very good purchase_the best combination of burt bees products, all of them work really good, i definitely will buy more of this to give to my friends"
8369,"Double Duty Palest Pink_I love Burt's Bees products, but I'd never tried anything from them that could be considered makeup. I like this because it isn't so gooey it tacks your lips together or you end up eating it with one's food. I love the color. It's pale enough that it doesn't fight with a lipstick color you might be wearing. But it also leaves just a hint of pink and gloss for a totally natural look when used all by itself. You know, those days when you don't have time to spend in front of the mirror.  I have a motto for it.  Smear and Go!  And if Burt's wants to use it, I'm getting it copyrighted or trademarked or whatever. (-:"
5547,"BEST LANEIGE PRODUCT_Instead of wasting money buying a lot of sleeping masks and facial masks, you should buy laneige's sleeping pack.It is raved as one of laneige's best products for a reason. A dime size amount can cover your entire face, and it feels so amazing. I used this during finals week (when my skin was feeling dehydrated and stressed) and it did wonders. This sleeping pack left my skin smooth and bouncy the next morning. It also helped with any acne or hyper pigmentation I had the night before. I also heard it is great to use on long airplanes rides...looking forward to using it then:))"
5056,"LOVE it!_I just decided to try this as I'm not really a gel person but my five year old loves gel in his hair and I wanted a natural product.  My boys and I have 3a and 3b curls and this stuff is awesome.  On my boys I just put it in their damp hair and it  leaves it really shiny with no shrinkage and no flakes, their curls look great.  It does dry kind of hard but for my boys they like the shiny wet look.  For me after my hair is dry or nearly dry I just 'scrunch out the crunch'  and my curls look awesome and they are soft and look shiny and healthy.  I never thought I could even like a gel but I just love this stuff."
7333,"I see improvement already._I can see new hair growing, and my hair strands have thickened. My scalp feels great, no itching whatsoever. In fact, I also put it on the rest of my hair after massaging my scalp, for better results. This  product smells good, that from time to time, I get compliments on how good my hair smells."
9854,Great for hands!_I use this on my really dry hands especially around the nails. It helps with the painful cracking and keeps them moisturized and the oil is quickly absorbed. It lasts a lot longer than any lotion I have used.
3898,"Very nice rosemary_I really liked this rosemary oil. I paired it with the peppermint, and they smell really nice together. I would definitely buy these again."
8515,"not for my husband's scalp_This was an amazon vine product and I did not even want to review it. If I have nothing nice to say, I rather not say anything. It really did not make scalp any healthier and even the other way around. No bueno."
4341,"uncomfortable case_awkward packaging - I wish I could get them out of this case!  the product is ok, buy nothing I have found is as good as outlast."
9319,"Smells nice_Thus far, I have yet to have an allergic reaction to this lotion. Most lotion tends to give me rashes but this one seems like it's comforting and I like the smell. However, it does not seem like it's working on dry skin so much as it makes normal skin feel shiny."
7519,nice set_I have tried every type of gel polish and I find that gelish and I get along much better than other brands. I don't know if I am too tough on my nails or if my nail beds are just naturally very oily (even after prepping them with the ph prepper) most like to start lifting on me. This brand and I get along and it even plays along nicely with the other brands as well. I have been putting some of my opi gel polish color over it and I get the best of both worlds.
9324,"I would Purchase more!_The brush came in a sealed plastic baggy. Inside the plastic baggy the brush was also covered by a little plastic brush protector. I liked the way this was packaged, I knew there werent going to be many germs that found its way to my brush. At first glance this brush looked soft. It had a nice weight to it. It is heavier than most of my other makeup brushes. I like the weight of it in my hands. It is not too heavy.  Definitely can tell  it is made up of nice quality material. After unpacking the brush I finally got to get my hands on the brush to see  if it was just as soft as it looked. It was. I was very surprised. There aren't many brushes that look this dense and are also soft. I played with it a little in my hands, moving the brush around, fanning the brush out, just trying to see if there was any fall out. I did not have any. It was so soft I loved just brushing it on my face. Next, I washed the brush. I always wash my brushes when I buy them because you just do not know if any germs have found a home. I washed the brush like I do all my others. I had no fallout. I made sure to keep water from getting under the metal. I hung the brush upside down to dry. It dried perfect just like how it was when it came to be mine. I tested this brush out my using it for every step of the way in putting on my face. This brush was perfect for blending in my concealer, buffing out my foundation and contouring my features. This brush has many uses. I have not picked a favorite use for it yet. I think this is a great quality brush and would purchase it in the future."
2375,"Roc Complete Lift Serum_It works. That's why I like it.It does what it says it will do. make your skin better.To men and women who want to have a healthier, younger look...buy this, and the accompanying products."
4157,"makes mani and pedi last longer_this is good stuff here,i use it right after my nail  apts. to extend the time between polishing no chips,cracks what soever for atleast 2 to 3 weeks ,great buy"
3769,"Colors aren't good_It's odd, but all the darker shades look the same once I put them on -- all a smoky black shade.  Won't use."
2173,"Works well, but very thick_I've been using this lotion as a natural alternative to my philosophy products, since finding out I was pregnant.  I feel good about the ingredients but the lotion takes a long time to absorb. It leaves my body feeling sticky. Overall though, it does a great job of moisturizing."
5615,"Deeper, Darker Tan that's NOT ORANGEY and doesn't streak._For years I'd been using Comodynes Self-Tanning Towelettes. The Comodynes always gave me a very even, non-orangey colored tan. One day my roommate came home and gave me a sample packet of these that she got from Sephora. I can't tell you how much deeper and darker the tan is that these give. It's like night and day, compared to what I was using. I love them and have officially switched!"
7903,"wonderful little hair pins, great price_I thought that there was only four in a set however there was 10 in each set I ordered 3 sets so I thirty of them these really work I have given away quit a few, These small spiral hair pins really hold all my hair up. You can not bet the price at all."
3212,"Use for CND Shellac, OPI Gel Color, TruGel, Gelish, Red Carpet Manicure etc._My favorite sog off gel brand is CND Shellac, but this UV light can be used for all other brands.  You just have to adjust the timing as needed by brand (i.e. OPI Gel Color- 3 minutes).  From the other reviews I was expecting it to be bigger.  But it's lightweight and appropriately sized for the job.  Be sure to look underneath the unit when you unpack because the bulbs are in a false bottom.  They also need to be seated properly in the bulb fixture inside.  Take your time and fit them in securely.This cuts down my time by half because I can fit both hands and alternatively both feet in the unit.  Considering the time savings and the fact that I can use this for all my gel products, this was the most logical, budget minded choice.  Easily cures my soak off gel.  The timers work well.  Highly recommended."
464,"Years of use and I'm still as happy as the day I purchased it._I bought this flat iron several years ago from a different website.  I had used many inexpensive flat irons in the past and they really damaged my hair.  Plus, I'd only get about a year out of them before they would die.  I researched a lot online before I ended up buying the Solia.This is a great quality professional flat iron.  My hair is the healthiest that it's ever been.  The flat iron heats up quickly, gets hot enough to straighten my long curly hair in 15 minutes, and has a nice long cord that doesn't tangle.  The cheap flat irons used to take over half an hour to straighten my hair.  There are two things you need to keep in mind when using this flat iron:1.  This is a professional flat iron, which means that it doesn't have an automatic shut off.  That being said, I think the fact that this flat iron is made to be used frequently is the reason why mine has lasted so many years.2.  You must use some sort of heat protectant before you use the flat iron.  I usually put some Biosilk Silk Therapy in my wet hair, blow dry, separate into sections, and then flat iron one section at a time.I can't think of anything negative to say about this flat iron.  I love it.  Over the years, several friends have used it and have ended up buying the same one because they liked it so much more than theirs.  It was definitely worth the cost to me since by now, I would have spent much more money replacing with a cheap one every year."
5280,"Two different textures, great for removing nail polish and toner_These cotton rounds have a softer side and a more textured sides, both are great.  I use the rounds to remove nail polish and apply toner."
1596,"Great_This is perfect for washing my face before bed, I have very dry skin and get acne very easy, this is a soft rub, smells great and not over powering, nice and light (relaxing)."
6361,"So Far, So Good ..._I haven't yet finished one container of this shampoo, so I don't know if it gradually lightens hair or not.  But having been a lifelong blonde, I know that blonde hair benefits from shampoo that removes all residue and build-up. Naturally blonde hair will lose its shine and luster with practically no provocation.  (In fact, one tried-and-true treatment is a final rinse of lemon juice, to get hair squeaky clean.)  This shampoo seems to produce the kind of brightness blondes are looking for, and I imagine the makers have taken care not to let it be as harsh as the old lemon-juice treatment was.  It doesn't leave hair feeling stripped, just clean.  What many manufacturers don't realize is that blonde hair -- which is often very light and fine -- cannot tolerate the same chemicals used to give shine to other types of hair. They just weigh blonde hair down and leave it looking sad and wilted.  This shampoo doesn't seem to resort to such chemicals to produce shine. It's all about lightness and brightness.Another nice plus is that it's quite concentrated, so a little goes a long way."
7998,"excelente product_The wait cun many cravings and luckily arrived in perfect condition, is a product of very good quality as I imagined. re like me. thanks"
2470,in love_Wonderful color. I have ivory skin and this goes perfect. Never leave the house without it. Favorite product right now
7123,"NICE COLOR....LOVE IT_I love OPI, never can wrong. I love this color. The shipment was fast too. Just need about a few coats and it looks awesome. Love it!"
8036,Neckline Slimmer_Yes this product works the muscles and you have to actually take time to use it and it will work. Just like everything else in exercise you have to commit to do it. I could tell a difference in the short time I used it. I stopped due to I got sick and now I have to start all over again. Yes I recommend it.
710,"Best face cleanser!_Believe me when I write that I am a product junkie!! This stuff while inexpensive and without any fancy scents or skin reactions (like cooling or warming) is a fantastic product. It cleans my very combination skin well, minimizes the appears of nose pores, minimizes breakouts and it doesnt dry my skin. This is the best facial cleanser for people with normal to dry OR combination skin."
5758,Best low end price brushes_I usually buy all high end brushes and my favorite is Trish McEvoy brushes but these brushes are fabulous for the price and even if they were a bit more they would still be worth it!Also she has a link that you can go online and she shows you how to use the brushes properly!
2195,Really like it_I really like the way the Rose Hip Seed Oil feels on my face. I am trying to use more natural products and this works for me.
7590,"Smells so good on my wife._The smokey raspberry scent is wonderful.. Has other flowery or sweet notes in it..My wife can use as much of this as she wants to..it's a pretty fragrance.The tin flowers on top make it look like it's a cheap bottle...Good price for such a large amount of a nice, sweet, light scent that is super girly.I bought my wife and daughter this because I overheard them talking abouthow much they both love this stuff."
8423,A Good Product!_I thought the shampoo worked well for me. It didn't leave my hair dry or tangled. It has a pleasant scent and it is reasonably priced. And it left my hair more manageable and less frizzy. I would definitely recommend it.
1346,"Daily Facial Exfoliating Wash and Masque!!!_1. I use this as a facial masque at least once a week. Moisten face and apply this creamy wash and let it dry. Then massage the DRY goop around your face in circular motions as you would cleansing grains/facial scrub. Rinse thoroughly and pat dry. Apply AMBI Fade Cream2. I also use this product as a wash every evening before I use the AMBI Fade Cream.I love this product, just can't find it at the stores frequently. Paid less than $6 per tube, noticed it's up to $22 for three. At the time I purchased it was included in Free Shipping order. Not sure I'd pay the higher price for it though.UPDATE 3/13/2011: FYI Ambi is a Johnson & Johnson Company along with Neutrogena, Clean & Clear etc. So many products/lines are disappearing and replacements not communicated. So necessity has become the mother of invention AND research. I found other creative sorts using a dab of this exfoliating wash on a damp wash cloth with the Neutrogena Wave instead of exfoliating pad refills that are scarce and/or pricey. Well this 'experiment' results in an at-home microdermabrasion treatment on par with my aesthetician/facialist visit; of course I follow up with my Ambi cream :) As with Neutrogena Wave directions DO NOT spend more than 2 minutes in any one area on the face to avoid irritation."
2129,"Great product_Great product, will keep buying and its much cheaper then in sephora store, the best eye shadow primer ive ever used."
6683,"Love the cooling effect!_This sunscreen hits every mark in my book, and I really like the cooling effect which is nice when you've left the can in a hot car, or on those extra-hot days. It just feels good. Coverage is easy to acheive with the spray nozzle, and you can spread the sunscreen even more by rubbing it in, although this isn't necessary. The nozzle locks, so you don't have to worry about losing a cap or it spraying when it shouldn't. The scent is a little more masculine than other sunscreen's I've used, but pleasant enough.SPF 30 is perfect for this family--we're of Scandinavian heritage and thus very pale, we burn to a crisp in mere minutes in the sun! Just as I expected with a quality sunscreen, this Banana Boat Sport performed very well and got the job done. I'd definitely recommend this sunscreen to those in need of a good sport formula and looking to stay extra-cool this summer!"
334,good_Very good quality brush .perfect with concealer application .makes a big difference when u have the right brushes and bare essentials is got the best
4498,"Better Than Expected_Not a fan of most self tanning products. However, this one builds a gradual tan with regular use and doesn't have an obnoxious odor."
3223,Not up to the hype_I bought this because of the 'consumer' reporter on our local news.  Never again Carol!  This won't even get through my thin baby fine hair.  I can't even image what it would do to my tender headed thick haired daughter.
742,its nice_cant say much it gets the job done well so i like the nozzle thing too i cant really thing about any thing
7299,"Leaves my hair super soft and prevents itchy scalp_I am forced to be very selective about what type of shampoo and conditioner that I use because many do not agree with my hair and scalp. If I use the wrong shampoo it will make my scalp itchy and will cause flakes. Some shampoo will make my hair feel very oily as well.I usually use Anti-Dandruff shampoo about half of the time and then a regular shampoo the other half. This  2 in 1 shampoo / conditioner has a nice scent and lathers very well. It's thinner consistency than most shampoo but it doesn't matter much to me. It is also competitively priced.It has twice the Pyrithione Zinc that most Anti-Dandruff shampoo has, which makes it very effective. It also moisturizes my hair very well and leaves it super soft and manageable. I can't say that I noticed any specific benefit to my scalp when compared to some of their other types of shampoo but it certainly leaves my hair softer than any other shampoo / conditioner combo that I have used so far. I believe this will become a regular shampoo for me."
9370,"Best ORGANIC Vitamin C Serum I have used yet._Things I did not like but LOVED- Packaging was nice!- Dropper makes it very easy to use & apply- Face feels plumper, firmer, softer, BETER after using on a regular, consistent basis.- NOT Tested on animals!Things I feel can be improved on but DO NOT affect the results of Product- Scent is more earthy or woodsy. HOWEVERthat being said it is organic & I feel that trumps scent.So,all in all I really liked this product. I notice great improvement in my skin so I rated this 5 out of 5 stars!"
3085,"A Good all purpose moisturizer at a great price, with clean packaging._Good cleansing with a pleasant aroma and moisturizing.  It rinses well and the packaging is also nicely countoured.  It's one of my favorite personal cleansing washes."
9965,"Worked immediately, felt and saw results within 2 weeks_Yup that's right, 2 weeks, I still can't believe it myself, that's why I came on here to post this review, it's incredible. I started feelingthe results from this shampoo after the first few uses in the first week, and by the second week I was actually seeing and noticing theresults. My hair was fuller and longer. I feel like I am getting younger, not older like I felt 3 weeks ago losing my hair. I highly recommended this shampoo to ANYBODY needing a chance at better and healthier hair. I had great success so far and I think anyone else maytoo. It's worth a shot guys, give it a try."
3101,"A Good Loose Powder_I don't actively look for natural beauty products, but I'm not above using one, so when I saw this one and the price was good, I thought I'd try it out. It's a very nice loose powder. It is very finely milled, so I feel like it covers very nicely. It also holds up well in 100+ degree weather."
3970,"Love, love, love it_A little of this on my fingers, tickled into my hair and then brushed through, will keep frizz down for me like nothing else. It takes such a tiny amount that this bottle will last....I have no idea how long it is going to last at this rate."
8462,"Awesome shampoo with a color certainly not found in nature, but effective and smells great_This shampoo from Axe is advertised as a 2-in-1 Shampoo plus conditioner product, designed to have a great 'masculine' smell, clean, and condition all at the same time.  The bottle is quite convenient, with a flip-top lid and easy dispensing from the top.  I've used Axe products before and am used to the general Axe aroma - it is masculine but not heavy, quite an agreeable aroma for the hair.  The odor lingers a bit but does not leave me smelling all day.My one comment, and it is not a negative, is that the color is certainly not something found in nature.  It is this wild blue/turquoise shade that looks like it could be something radioactive that oozed from the local lab.  It was quite cool actually - a nice part of the style.As for performance, like any good 2-in-1, my hair is not quite as conditioned as if I used a separate conditioner, but it left my short hair manageable without needing the separate conditioner for every washing.  Recommended product!"
9161,"The Original & The BEST!!_If you continue to offer me this German made Nivea I'll be loyal for life.. I just returned to Amazon two bottles of their cloying ineffectual 'oil of olay' lotion and just had no idea what to buy for my scaling dry red skin, I purchased Nivea in the past but the walmart brand made in Mexico I am sorry but IT ISN'T THE SAME THING. It is soupy and not fit to be called creme. I only wish I can also find German made Fa. The Fa aimed to the American market is again a silly ineffectual product. I don't get it? Why not stick to the original make with some fidelity?"
605,"I love this product..._I think you will like this product just for the way it makes your skin feel - let alone how it makes your skin look! Yes, it is worth the money."
62,Really Nice Light Leave in Conditioner_No grease or oil. Just a nice leave in conditioner that deals with dry looking frizzy hair. Worked with my hair type - good stuff!
1636,"TanTowel Look Good Naked Self-Tan Towelettes 10 piece_I would say TanTowel Look Good Naked Self-Tan Towelettes create the most natural-looking fake tan I have ever seen. One of my friends shocked me when she told me that she's been using them since forever, because I honestly believed that she does in fact have olive skin by default. She showed my her &#34;before&#34; pictures - and she was like a snowflake! Needless to say, I have been buying these ever since."
2133,"Good_I like Poshe top coat better than most others. It dries SUPER fast &#60;2 minutes, and it is super shiny."
5331,Great nail lacquers_I know not everyone likes these colors but I do. I put an undercover on first and then the next two layers. Each color has a sheen to it that is attractive. I would buy this again.
2658,Anastasia brow pen_This is my second Anastasia brow pen and it is very long lasting.It provides a natural look and it is quick to apply.
1748,Great sunscreen_I bought this for my daughter who has eczema and is sensitive to most sunblocks. It worked great. I used it on my face and I didn't have any issues with the residue getting into my eyes and burning like most do. Would definitely use again.
5422,"the brown and black are good_I bought this because I like to change up the makeup all the time, however, I really only like the brown and black in this set.  The green and purple are pretty in the bottle, but are very light on skin, I have a very fair complexion so this surprised me."
6287,"Pretty strong_These are great scrubs pads, however, quite strong. Sometimes my face burns a little after using them. They are the closest pad I have found to what I used to have in the Neutrogena scrub pads for acne."
5660,Great Product_I love constantly changing my nail color and putting different designs on my nails. These dotting pens have made it possible for me to effectively create unique art on my nails.
5113,"Best Shampoo Ever!_I use this product for my own personal hair care and my cat for approximately 2-3 months. My hair has never been so healthy and strong; i have very thin hair that snaps if the wind blows too hard. I can't express how pleased i have been with Mane 'N Tail. I have searched high and low for a product that does not contain such harsh chemicals (ex:sulfate) with a tolerable smell. Before purchasing the set on Amazon, i would buy them at my local Walmart/Target for approximately the same price (sold individually in the pet aisle). About two weeks ago, i went into the store and noticed the bottles are smaller and more expensive. Also, i think the word is getting around which means limited stock."
4449,"Da best_This is my favorite hair accessory ever. It literally takes 5-10 minutes to curl my whole head.  After I use hairspray, the curl really stays.  When I am in a rush and I do not have time to straighten my hair, I use the bed head deep waver.  I encourage you to buy it, you will not be disappointed."
87,"Works as advertised._I use this to treat breakouts on my arms, chest and back. Using it once - twice a day has eliminated it completely. Be sure to pair with a good moisturizer that suites your skin type."
5603,Wonderful and refreshing!_Cleanses and does not dry out my skin. Feels nice and refreshing. Perfect for travelling. Natural and no animal testing which is something that is important to me. Love them!
4707,The best_I love this product. I works great for me and I have not problem removing the shellac from my nails.
6836,"HUGE!_I guess I didn't read the fine lines on it, but when I received it, I was shocked at the sheer size of the machine.  I'd never seen one this large, not even at the nail salon.  And as far as it working, it worked less well than the $10 Kiss UV curing light I bought from Walgreens.  I ended up going back to the cheap one.  It's small and works better."
4652,Mineral Veil_Bare escentuals origninal mineral Veil two gram product was as advertised!  pride better than in the local store carrying these products.
7696,"The color of any season_love ,love, love, love it. This the new black. Everyone wear black nails, because its the trending style. I wear this color, because I am one peculiar person. I love the consistency of this color, and love the shine of the final coat of the nail polish."
7544,just what i asked for_I use this to dry brush my skin before showering.  It helps promote circulation and exfoliates the skin.  This brush is not to soft and not to harsh.  Its just what i asked for.
8258,"Keeps Skin Soft_This is a great lotion for any guy that spends a lot of time outdoors. Cold and wind are very hard on your face.  Hubby said his skin quickly absorbed the lotion, and it did not leave his skin feeling greasy. I like it because it does not have an over-powering scent."
6154,"Small_When I placed order it said the canes would be 2 inches, I was not very happy when I found they were 1 inch! Please be aware they may only be 100 of the one inch canes although there were some cute designs I would not repurchase."
5873,Not for me_THis is so hard to use. It always smudges everywhere and it takes forever to dry and doesn't stick for so long. :(
2335,Smells great and works well_A little bit goes a long way with this eye cream. I have used Olay since I turned 18 years old. I am 30 now and people still think I am in my lower twenties. This product helps keep the skin around your eyes tight.
625,best treat for clear and radiant skin_This is a DAILY and GENTLE exfoliant.  Sprinkle a little in your wet hand and rub into a paste.  Then work it into your damp or wet face.  Rinse.  This product is in my top 5 beauty staples.  I will never be without.
2073,"Not for me_The label promises not to dry your skin, and to leave you feeling 'energized', and for some values of 'energized' I suppose this product succeeds in that. No 'truth in advertising' laws are broken.In fact, far from drying, I just found this product terribly greasy. It left behind an oily residue that would not rinse off with hot water. Furthermore, the 'energy' is provided by a heavy dose of menthol. If you can imagine the sensation of covering yourself from head to toe in Vick's Vap-o-Rub, you can imagine the sort of energy you would feel with this body wash. Some sensitive parts of my anatomy felt downright uncomfortable. The product also smells strongly of Old Spice. Luckily, there was still a bar of soap in the shower, and I was able to wash this glop off using it; no permanent damage was done, but I won't be using it again.Not recommended, unless that Vap-o-Rub bath idea sounds like a good plan to you."
9040,crystal hair pins_these are lovely and look exactly as they do on line.  they are very large and should be used to pin either long or thick hair.  they arrived two weeks earlier than expected.  thank you.
9065,"GREAT BASIC GO -TO PENCIL_I gave this pencil 5 stars because it is fantastic, I have paid far more for some that say they don't smudge and then they are all over, this one holds up pretty good, you may get some smudge from the waterline after quite a few hours of wear , which is not that bad, but I switched to gel eyeliner for the waterline, and I use this pencil for the upper inner corners, and my bottom base of my lashes and it doesnt' run all over the place there. I love the smudger applicator tip,  That is one of moy favorite things about this eyeliner pencil, very handy, and you cannot beat the price!"
5333,Works great!_This stuff is amazing! It definitely is crack for your hair! It makes my hair soft and easy to blow dry. It also doesn't weigh my hair down after I use it. With thinning hair that can be a huge problem! I only use a dab and it seems to cover my entire hair. This will last forever but I love it!
9855,Great stuff!_This Argan oil is top of the line! I use argan oil quite often for my hair and love it. A lot of argan oil has added ingredients that does not truly make it 100% argan oil but this stuff is the real deal. I have used it for about a week and my hair is so soft I just can't stop touching it! Thanks VoilaVe!
895,"Great Moisturizer_I recently started an HCG diet which recommends not using any oils on the body. I am 54 and was skeptical that an oil free moisturizer would be OK for my face, but this works great! This moisturizer has a light fresh fragrance, and leaves my skin soft and smooth, plus I trust Alba Botanica to use safe ingredients."
6669,Great moisturizing power and very lightweight_This product has a pleasant scent and the moisturizing power provided by the hydration ribbons is superior. The best part is that all of this extra moisturizing power is provided with high SPF 30 in a product that does on feeling extremely lightweight.Love it!
4718,Lovely product_Love this stuff. Use it in the morning and at night. Has a slightly sweet smell. I have sensitive skin and it has never given me a problem. Been looking for a nice facial cream without any harmful chemicals and no mineral oils in it. Little seems to go a long way. Will buy again once I run out!
1000,"Excellent!_I love this brush. It's a must have for ladies with long hair. It has a really large barrel, the bristles are long and flexible enough to handle thicker hair. This brush makes blowdrying so much easier! It is also good for professionals, as there is a separator in the handle of the brush, that you can use to easily get a section of hair with- probably wouldn't use it much on yourself, but it is very convenient to have when you work on someone.Great quality, not too heavy, great for smoothing out hair. Absolutely recommended!"
3564,Good but burns your eyes!_I love Burt's Bees but this product is slightly disappointing. It smells really good and makes my skin soft but it burns my eyes so bad that I end up in pain every time I use it! I have tried to avoid my eyes but it somehow gets in them or on my hands. I don't know what's in this stuff but be careful!
3853,"Bad shipping?_It's a pretty color and all, but when I got it the clear center plastic piece was broken and had fallen in. And the powder was crushed and banged up. I'm guessing it's the product of bad shipping, but I'm going to return it and hopefully get a new one."
8473,"Doesn't Raise a Stink_Well, what can one say about a nice-smelling body wash that's for every nook, cranny, and hair on your body? The smell is just right--pleasant without being cloying; the lather is great, creamy and rinses off easily; and the convenience saves times because you can scrub yourself down from head to toe when you're in a hurry with a single product. And condition your hair too! In truth, you could probably do the same with any number of shampoos and body washes--after all, in the end, they're all just soap, but if you're looking for a solid all-in-one with an agreeable smell that does NOT linger, this is an okay choice."
4644,Yummy!_This is one of the best smelling lotions ever! It's a very clean soothing smell. I would definitely recommend this to any woman who uses lotion often. It's a nice smell that is not overpowering.
4928,"Eh. Nothing Dramatic_It didn't harm anything - eg, I didn't break out or get a rash, but it just didn't do anything either. I was looking for a clean alternative to my Olay Regenerist Night Resurfacing Elixir, but sadly this is not it. Too bad, as I love much of the rest of the Acure line, especially their shampoos and their body lotions."
8031,"Overpriced, not pleasing to use and provided no noticeable improvement in skin_My wife had been using this product but discontinued using it after a couple weeks because of her dislike of it.She used to work for a high-end cosmetics company and has tried other products similar in purpose. Her feeling is that for such an expensive product, the Ainhoa Whitess Caviar Renewal Serum did not have a pleasing scent nor did it feel luxurious on the face.My wife thinks that a product that is priced in this arena should be providing a more enjoyable experience. However even if the smell were more pleasant and the feeling on skin were more pleasing, the product would also need to provide a tangible benefit and in the time my wife used this, no improvement in skin was noticed.She would not recommend this product based on her experience with it."
2716,"Good Body/Face Lotion_Vaseline makes good products, and this is one of its better ones. It has a nice scent, moisturized my skin instantaneously and it has a nice texture. If you're looking for a new lotion, it's worth checking out."
5137,"great matte shadow_for this price, you are getting a good deal on a highly pigmented shadow. soft to apply. can be used for crease or brows. better to use a brush and not the applicator included. the applicator absorbs too much of the shadow and it's hard to get the shadow off of it."
974,"not sure yet, but..._I have used it only twice. My skin does feel soft after. It does smell ok and it doesn't burn or anything. I have ultra sensitive skin and I haven't gotten any pimples from it (though I put my usual benzoyl-peroxide lotion on after). I just wanted to make the note that if you have acne-prone skin you don't have to be afraid to use this, if you continue to use your usual acne-fighting products. I don't see any harm in trying this product but I don't really think it has the same scar-removing potential as a real medical/spa procedure. If I see some real improvement in my current acne scars I will update my review."
1038,"Excellent_The product is good,  I really like it. my nails are strong and growing. My polish stay longing and that good"
5315,"Excellent product_My daughter use Roc products since were recommended and she loves this brand. She uses night, day and eyes products."
3625,"Texturized_When the product comes out it is very glue like.  However, with patience the product thickens hair and styles quite nicely.  I will certainly purchase again.  Good product."
827,Mitsouko by Guerlain_Mitsouko has kind of a musky scent to it which I love.  It keeps it scent all day long.  I just love this perfume!
8662,"Dove Men+Care Cool Silver Antiperspirant_I will say right up front that this antiperspirant works well.  After using this product my husband went a little over 48 hours without having a shower, and he had absolutely no body odor or sweat.  Yes - I did actually sniff his arm-pits to verify this.  Now his average work-day does not involve a lot of strenuous activity or sweating, but with his regular antiperspirant or deodorant usually by the end of the day there is some amount of BO there.  With the Dove Men+Care Cool Silver Antiperspirant there was absolutely no BO.That being said - we are making an effort to avoid certain personal products with known harmful ingredients.  While this product avoids the commonly used and known harmful ingredient of aluminum which is common in most antiperspirants, it does still contain a few other ingredients that are known to be linked to cancer (BHT and titanium dioxide).  Knowing these ingredients are in the product, we will limit it's use to extremely hot/humid summer days when my husband knows he will need the extra protection from sweat and BO.  Otherwise, he will stick to products that are safer and that we are happier using (Tom's of Maine, Lexie's Home-made Deodorant)."
1798,"miracle in a bottle._I'm a 23 year old mother of 2. I used cocoa butter religiously throughout my pregnancies, but it didn't help at all. Like a lot of women that have had children, I ended up with some stretch marks. My stretch marks are mostly on my stomach and upper outer thighs. I had seen commercials for Bio Oil so I decided to read some reviews and see what people thought of it. After reading enough positive reviews, I decided to purchase it for myself. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now (twice a day) and there is definitely a noticeable difference in the appearance of my stretch marks. I was a little skeptical at first because I've tried other products that haven't helped at all. Bio Oil is really working for me though, and it's giving me my confidence back!! I didn't tell my fiance that I've been using this and HE even noticed a difference (it has to be a BIG difference for him to notice anything... you know how men are... LOL). I definitely recommend that everyone with stretch marks and/or scars tries this product. What do you have to lose?! It's only about $12 with shipping and it works better than ALL of the high end products I've tried!!"
6,STILL IN USE_Wanted a curling iron with all the features offered by this one.  Am very pleased with it and would buy another.
7239,cheap_i rate this a 4 because it is a good value for the low price. i am satisfied with my purchase
9007,GREAT PRODUCT_AWESOME PROTECTION BUYING MORE MUST LEAVE ON YOUR FACE 15 MINS BEFORE GOING OUT IN THE SUNAND MUST RE APPLY
2118,"Stick with your Chi_I bought this as a backup flatiron when I found it dirt cheap. I was hoping that it might outperform my trusty Chi & I would have a nice, shiny new flatiron, but I should have known better. I've used it several times now and with or without steam, it simply does not straighten as well as the Chi, even with the temperature controls.The water reservoir is ridiculously small, and you literally have to use an eyedropper to fill it. I like that it has a long power cord and automatic shut off, but ultimately neither of these features make up for the fact that this flatiron does not straighten as well as my Chi, no matter how small I make my hair sections or how many passes I make.In places where my hair is relatively straight to begin with, it will give it a more flat, polished look, but it doesn't even come close to taming my mermaid waves in the back. I think it also makes my hair feel more dry and brittle. It's better than nothing, but you should save your money and invest in a Chi. The steam, comb and temperature controls are gimmicks that simply don't work. Skip it unless you're in some sort of a pinch and can't find a styling tool that's decent."
382,"My HG bronzer_Great bronzer, super natural looking.. Never 'dirty,' or 'orange.' This stuff is great! I have purchased this repeatedly and I rarely buy the same product twice. I'm always looking for something better... so that says a lot. Have not found any bronzer to match the natural-ness of this. I apply it w/ my MAC187 on the forehead/temple/cheekbone area. Gives definition/dimension to my round Asian face. Love it!"
84,"Oh my .. Miracle!_I have had acne when I was a teenager of course I went to the doctor and got creams for it. I wish they had this 15 years ago. The teenager acne went away over the years and I never really had a problem with it again. I'm till about three months ago when my mother suddenly passed away. Flying overseas to see my family (we are a family and I am German) And all the stress and helping them with the funeral and everything ,plus the time difference, bad food -everything ..took it's toll on my skin.When we got back about a couple of days later I got the bill my skin broke out like I have never seen it before. It was worse than when I was a teenager and I'm 30 years old.For as long as I can remember I have always I cleaned my face every day with 'clean& clear ' facial cleaner and I put acne spot treatment on pimples that  just show up like everybody has them. Of course when I am close to getting my periode its worse. But I have never had it like this ! I had him on the temples of my head and my forehead and under my chin and on my jawbone. Also someone my cheeks, chest area and back..My husband had tried out Proactive the year before and I have tried it sometimes on my skin . but I have to say it always dried my skin out and burned and didn't really help. I sent it back and told them I am done.So when I have to outbreak I had no idea what to do . so I look on Amazon and read through a couple of things and I saw this and ordered it . because I thought I have nothing to loose.I took it and within two weeks my skin cleared up and of course I changed my eating habits again to my normal diet plan. But this really really helped!! felt that the cream also made a big difference in that and if you follow with it it really changes something in your body. After another week my acne was pretty much gone. Even when I'm close or having my period My skin has less pimples than before! I didn't even show any more than that iam on my periode!My skin stays clear all month long and I will be reordering because I am done now with my 60 day pack.I have never seen anything this effective and I like I said you should try it . for $13 you have nothing to lose but only to gain clear skin.On a side note :I also bought the ' clearzine' u can buy on Amazon too and took that the first week as well additionally to the natures cure. I think it  made a big difference too but for the price it's a little bit too expensive but like I said I was desperate.Also I bought the acne spray from natures plus for my back . Again for the price a little bit too expensive .I have to say you can also use any facial cleaner and rub down your neck if you have a partner or boyfriend to do it for you. If not the spray is perfect because you can use it on any angle."
7575,Better Than Botox?_I think these work on a temporary basis...they seemed to fill in the tiny lines and itty bitty wrinkles that life has given me!  I am happy with them and so s my husband...lol...
682,"I received a legitimate one_I like this product.  The smell is fresh and clean, and I frequently get complements from wearing it.  Unlike other fragrances, it is not overpowering.  From the advice of a woman at one of the major department stores, she recommended this one to me.  I love it so much I bought one from Amazon when my supply ran out.  This particular bottle size lasted me about two years.  I'm very pleased with it.I highly recommend it."
169,"Queen Helene Original Formula Antioxidant Grape Seed Extract Peel Off... Queen Helene_Great mask, I can tell a difference in my skin after using it. Peel off masks make it so much easier and mess free so I'm thinking about sticking to them instead of any other masks. My only problem is that it doesn't help with pimples like the Mint Julep mask does under this brand."
5146,"Love it, and you will too!_My hair loves this product. After washing I use this conditioner, sometimes with heat sometimes without. It leaves my hair silky and manageable. I will definitely be keeping me a stash of this from now on."
3796,"Worst primer!_This primer is probably the worst I've ever used and now understand why it's a drugstore primer. It's definitely not high end or even mediocre. The primer is cakey and a sticky mess. Does not apply evenly or smoothly. It does matte your skin in preparation for foundation but is not an overall good product. Would not recommend and will not purchase again. In fact, I threw it away after about 5 uses."
9804,awsome!_Vitamin C serum is a natural way to produce collagen and great natural moisturizer for the skin. I used it on my clean skin and it makes my skin very soft. It is the one I was looking for. It smells a little bit strange but absorbs very fast.I just &lt;3 it and I can't wait to see its long term results :)
3041,"Good for the price_It's certainly not the best pressed powder around, but I picked it up at Target for a dollar, so it was a good deal. It's about five times that amount on Amazon, which is the first reason I wouldn't recommend buying it. Not here, anyway.This looks really nice when dusted over foundation. It doesn't look great on my skin if I don't already have on foundation, but it might look alright if your skin is already healthy looking. It's good for mattifying and has a fair amount of pigment. I like that it actually comes in yellow-toned pale shades. The packaging isn't the best, mostly because the clear plastic gets scratched up easily, but it works out for being lightweight and small. You don't get a ton of product in it, but you don't need to use much at once anyway. The puff thing isn't spectacular (when are they ever?), but it's not awful if you want to use it. I just use a blush/powder brush for a more even application. I haven't noticed any change in my skin's acne or anything, but it also hasn't made me break out at all, so that's a plus.Again, there are many better pressed powders out there, but this isn't a bad choice if you're on a budget."
423,Wonderful_If you do your own hair like me this is an absolute must have. I have ear length hair that is cut into a short bob so I must maintain the curls in the back. My old cheapie mirror was a waste I would have to contort my body to even get a good look at the back of my hair. This mirror is wide enough for the job and since having it I have never been able to see the whole back of my hair. Now that I can I don't have to make blind judgement calls. I love it!
970,"Nice Exfoliation_Great product for exfoliation.  Just enough granules to exfoliate without being to harsh on skin.  The second step tingles a bit, but works to dissolve the granules and add that extra lactic acid exfoliation before rinsing.  Skin feels great after using this product.  Especially great for the nose and chin area that tends to be a bit oily, cleans out the pores.  My sensitive combo skin loves a twice a week use.  Have used for over two years and will continue to use."
5424,"Nice_Great back brush.  The bristles are very stiff, so I've had to be careful not to brush too harshly or it's too rough on my skin."
2693,"Nicest feeling SPF moisturizer I ever used._Only need a tiny bit to apply to face and neck.  Unlike others I've used, makeup goes on afterward evenly and easily.  I will buy again."
4337,"Great product..even for Diaper Area!_OK, I love this product!  Let me start off by saying that I use it to moisturize my skin and hair.  However, when I ran out of Triple Paste ointment for my infant son one day, I decided to use this shea butter instead.  I'm glad that I did because it creates a great barrier in his diaper area and he does not get rashes on his VERY sensitive skin.  One does have to rub the shea butter in before applying but it melts easily.  His diaper area is so soft and rash free and not red at all.  I think that this is a great all over alternative with many uses.  In the cold winter months I use this on dry patches and it heals in about a day or two.  Great value for the amount of product that you get!"
984,"I love this mask_I love this mask. It's a little thicker than I would like but it really gets the job done. My face is almost like stone when its drying and I love it. The mask smells amazing, I'm a big mint fan and I love the way it smells. When I use this mask it really dries up my pimples and removes my blackheads. I like to use it about once or twice a week because I always break out during school due to stress. This mask has never failed me, and I love it. I would greatly recommend it!"
6482,"yay_great product! There is still a little bit of residue, but that is to be expected. They really are such a simple formula and great for removing makeup after a long night out!"
8390,"It works_The packaging doesn't tell you much, but I remember some years ago these were marketed on TV.  It really works.  Makes an easy bun or French roll, no problem.  You may need a little practice, but totally doable!"
9016,"A lot of fun and really nice set_I am new to stamping and these are so much fun to use!!!  I really like them, and have found that the designs are, on the whole, the right size for my nails.  Very nice and easy to store as they arrived in their own little leather-like pouch."
7986,"By the time you finish this bottle, your skin ..._By the time you finish this bottle, your skin is looking much younger and healthier!  I can see on my skin!!"
7269,"good product, not for pale people._I didnt like this product.  I am very pale and it was far too dark for me.  The one thing i do like is that it is truly full coverage.  It gives a dewey finish that you see in asian bb creams, andI do love that.  I just wish there was a lighter option, but this is as light as it goes."
8734,Essie Come Here!_This is a gorgeous deep coral tone that is perfect for summertime.  I like it on hands & feet and think it will be one of my go-to color's this year!  It's very opaque and only takes one to two coats to look perfect.
6835,"The light I would have bought!_This light is clearly amazing for a UV light, holding at 5 stars with a whopping 500 plus reviews. I decided, before ordering it, to find replacement bulbs first, because I have read that UV lights require occasional replacement bulbs. I found the right bulbs, each nine watt, and to order six of them for this 54 watt lamp, my order for bulbs cost as much as the lamp itself. So I held my finger over the &#34;Place Order&#34; button, here on Amazon, completely convinced that this UV lamp is absolutely NOT A MISTAKE purchase. I always research before I buy, and I am still convinced this light is one of the best UV LAMPS AVAILABLE, better than the one my nail gal uses at the shop.  But the cost to replace the bulbs stopped me from pressing to order. I ended up buying a lovely LED light instead, because I should never have to replace the bulbs and end up doubling or tripling or quadrupling the cost of the original light by buying bulbs. That said, I didn't want to drop $250 for an LED light, either. I found an LED light for $109, it is awesome, and I love that it cures my gels in 30 seconds a layer!  BUT, and it is a big but, I was able to pay a little over 50 bucks more for the LED light, and many gals don't have that option. I worried that I had made a bad choice, and maybe my fabulous LED light will break on me. So far, I'm in love with the super fast cures. I am too much of a klutz to paint all my fingernails on both hands to cure all eight fingers at once to save on curing time. So LED ALLOWS ME TO DO QUICK BETWEEN-layer cures. And I love that. HOWEVER, if I had purchased a UV LIGHT, this was my choice, and I recommend it to friends AND RELATIVES who can't afford to drop over $50 more for my LED. REVIEWS TALK!  All these customers who have this light swear by it, except for a dismal few who had bad experiences, for whatever reason. If you can't afford an LED, I truly feel this is the best buy out there.  If I hadn't been able to step up to LED, I would have this light and probably love it. I really like that it has a fan, plus the light, to dry regular nail polish fast. I talked with a nail tech about &#34;gelly sandwiches&#34; which begin with gel bonder, the gel base coat, regular polish, and a gel top coat. This allows you to use your stash of regular polish for fun colors. I have so many colors that I love in regular polish!  My LED may help dry them faster, but probably not. So though I will save on replacing bulbs with my fab LED light, maybe I will regret that my LED doesn't dry regular polish. And, hello, to replace all my regular polish with gel colors would be very costly. In short, did I make a smart choice?  This light rocks according to reviews. I was more concerned about time spent doing my nails. 30 second cures between layers means a lot to this busy lady.By the way, in all these fab reviews, I've seen references to heaps of very expensive gel polishes. I use IBD GEL  from base to top, and they are fabulous for so much less. Durable, great color selection, and I am in love. It is the brand my nail tech put on my nails, so I knew IBD WAS GREAT!  I ordered Good Gossip from Gellish, at a bigger cost, because i found it online as as a true ruby slipper color, one of my favorites, only to discover that the Cosmic Red from IBD is the same &#34;ruby slipper&#34; color. Now I have two ruby slipper bottles. I will send one to my niece. First I will compare the durability of the two brands, but with my IBD COLORS WEARNG SO WELL, I will never pay the much higher price again. Hello?  Why would anyone pay dollars more for another brand?  I don't get it.No, I am not an IBD rep. I am a novelist who is busy and needs to do her nails at midnight, or whenever I find time. Appointments?  For my hair and doctors, only. Going to the salon takes at least three hours to get my nails done, including driving time. I don't feel pampered; instead I feel stressed. At home, it is a treat, and IBD gels, or probably the more expensive gels as well, lend my fragile, chipping, peeling nails strength. With gels I have gorgeous nails, and this light would, I feel certain, give me just as good a cure, taking longer. Not here to sell anyone on anything. I think this light is a great buy, just research the cost of replacement bulbs before you hit &#34;Place Order.&#34;  And find out how often UV bulbs must be replaced. I don't know. If they last for two years, how much will you save by doing your own gels?  And, with this light, you can also do &#34;gelly sandwiches&#34; faster because of the fan and heat. Do your math for your wallet. I think this light is stellar, above and beyond most UV lights, and I nearly bought it.. Don't know yet if my LED  will stand the test of time.. I think this light would."
8358,"Great color and stay power_This nail enamel lasts a bit longer than others I find. I like it and will order other colors, since it wears so well. It's not the same as gel or s miracle in a bottle, but I am impressed just the same!"
2018,sucks_I don't know how this got good reviews. I like that it's tiny for small lines....but you can make that look with any eyeliner if you are precise. I find this eyeliner to be a huge waste of money. Most of your products will be broken off or crumbled off. It's very very weak. I am very precise and gentle and this will still break and crumble. I say save your cash skip this product and be more precise to make a small line with thicker eyeliners.
829,"Everyday usage, listed in top 10 in most reviews_I came across this while going through a few reviews on best fragrances for men. Darkar Noir fugured in all but one list.I decided to go ahead and buy a 6.7 ounce bottle as the price was irresistible.This is a great everyday perfume with a smell which is very similar to Kenneth Cole Black. Just go easy with the application as its very strong...2 sprays are good enough to last for 7-8 hours..."
182,"The best stuff really is the cheaper stuff!_I made the classic mistake of 'the fancier and more expensive the better' when I was a dedicated Aveeno user. I thought my skin was moisturized and protected, but I didn't know what I was missing out on until I gave this a shot! For MUCH less money, I get double the SPF (unheard of to find a 30 spf face moisturizer at this price!!) and fewer breakouts because of the minimal additives (fragrances/skin 'brighteners' read= literally GLITTER!)It leaves my skin soft without being oily and never feels tight or greasy after using. Now, I can slather this stuff on in the morning without wondering if I'm truly protecting myself from the sun and before bed without worrying about gross pimples popping up overnight!My mom was right - she always had Eucerin products around when I was a kid, and I've found out now for good reason! I hope they never stop making this stuff. It's done wonders for my skin and doesn't break my already tight budget."
5997,"Reusable lashes_If u luv fake lashes these are a must have product great all day wear this is my third order of them I even got my sister to get some great for a night out shipped sooner than expected :) .....,,, Lilly"
883,"No stars!  A major RIP-OFF!!!_The advertising for this so called miracle cure should have been the first red flag but somehow I believed this just might work.  It doesn't and it angers me to know I fell for the hype.  The packaging looks so professional and the cost was high enough that it gave the impression of a valuable product.  It isn't.  I am Italian and Greek and there isn't anything that will erase heredity and that is what most dark under eye circles are caused by.  If yours are from lack of sleep, get more sleep.  It they're from allergies, take Claritin but don't throw away $100.00 plus  on this tube of nothing.  It is not worth the money and can't do what is promised.  Please, just judge this product by the advertising picture.  It looks as if someone used black paint under the eyes of the model and then the after picture is perfect and they insinuate their product made the difference.The company that markets this useless cream is called 'Basic Research.'  Let that be a lesson to all of us, do some basic research first, before throwing away money on garbage.  Macy's and Amazon should immediately pull this item.  To do less would ruin the credibility of both companies, currently held in high regardUPDATE: I was able to get a refund through my local Macy's.  This isn't mentioned in the ad but the clerk there told me I wasn't the first to ask for my money back and I am sure,  won't be the last. The fact they took it back locally speaks volumes.Bottom line...save your money and don't fall for this one..it just doesn't work!!"
5669,"Good product_These were much more useful than we thought before ordering.  Very easy to use and clean.  I ordered this for my daughter, a 21 yo friend of ours and me, we all have fun doing nails together.  We still have them, and all of us enjoying using them making nail designs we find on YouTube.com"
6062,Seriously shocking neon yellow color_I was hoping for yellow.  This is road - worker/ convict/ running shoes / blind you under black light bright neon yellow.other than that it works great!
2692,"Work well, no added fragrance_When I first received these and pulled one out I was a little doubtful as it looked like a simple moist towelette that comes after a rib dinner.However, these things work extremely well, even for waterproof and heavily troweled-on makeup. The wipes have no odor, no chemical feel, and they cause no irritation, nor seem to leave behind any residue. They just take the makeup off leaving a clean feeling behind. Sometimes I have to use more than one, but that is a small price to pay.They are just fresh and pleasant to use. Finding a product that removes any and all makeup without feeling harsh on the skin is almost a miracle.Great job Neutrogena."
3267,Jumbo pencil_What I can say?!?! It is a white base that helps with those colors to be more vibrant. On ALL skin tones!!! There was no damage done. I ordered this pencil because it is better than the color tattoo bases IN MY OPINON.
2975,"Great eye cream, but doesn't really conceal_This is a GREAT product if you're looking for a basic eye cream.  I can't say I've noticed a change in terms of fine lines around my eyes, but that's ok as I'm not quite looking for that yet. However, if you're looking for something that doubles as a concealer, this isn't it. You'll need to use an additional product/concealer to truly conceal flaws/blemishes. However, the little bit of concealer does brighten up your skin, which is nice! Overall I would definitely recommend this product as an eyecream, but not something that doubles as a true concealer."
1305,"Perfect for air travel_**Note**  Didn't realize I wrote this review for the 4.4oz bottle.  Be sure to look for and purchase the smaller 2.1oz bottle if you intend to use it as I do for air travel.I travel a lot and I just hate what dry airplane air does to my skin.  By the end of a flight any makeup I've previously applied looks crepey, pores look huge and my skin looks oily and ashy at the same time.  Blotting does nothing and powdering just makes you look cakey.  Yuck.I have tried just plain water mists in the past without much success, with MyChelle, I stay fresh faced all throughout 'most' flights.  I found that the important part is misting regularly and long 'before' you reach 'icky flight skin' status.  Staying hydrated by drinking water (instead of adult beverages ;) in flight will also help some.This doesn't really spray on 'sticky' as another reviewer described but 'thick'.  I think it has something to do with how they treat the water.  It supposidly has a slower evaporation rate and so it sits longer on your face.  Once it dries completely, you will not feel as if there was anything on your face (no film or weird tack).  I have sensitive and acne prone skin - this product has not caused me to break out.  You can use this over your makeup or on plain skin.  I like knowing that the Fruit Enzymes are gently exfoliating during the days I go makeup free.Btw - close your eyes when spraying and careful not to lick your lips afterwards.  This stuff tastes gross - very bitter.  I almost always follow up with chapstick to dilute it off my lips and keep it outta my mouth."
2257,"clean feel and easy to apply_this is good for daily prevention. I dont think this will cure acne or treat pimples that have freshly developed but i find that this helps heal my acne and keeps it from returning. I use this every morning right after i wash my face. I only use this on my problem areas not my entire face. i often get pimples that are deep under the skin and can't be squeezed out. so I end up with a lot of purple scarring for months. I like this product because it feel clean when i put it on. Its not messy and very easy to travel with and to apply on my face. a lot of people compare this to witch hazel or a toner but I dont get that feeling. most toners leave residue or some kind of odd feeling layer on top of my skin, whereas this simply feels clean. like cold water. I just enjoy it."
6980,"Interesting but not sure how effective_I have a teenager who has some acne and blackheads, and I have always had an on and off relationship with acne and blackheads, so I thought between the two of us, we could benefit from this product.  At first, when you put it on your face in the shower, it does have a noticeable warm feeling.  Not sure if it's because I'm in the shower, but that feeling goes away after a few seconds.  Or, it could be because the product I was shipped in 3/14 was expired as of 6/13.  In any case, you don't need a lot of product to wash your face with this.  I keep it on for what I think is about a minute, so the salicylic acid gets a chance to work its magic.  It rinses off fairly easily, and I don't notice any dryness. I don't use it everyday, but maybe a few times a week.  I don't notice a huge difference in my blackhead area; the end of my nose, but the area isn't that bad right now.  In the summer, when I sweat a lot I will be able to see how effective this cleanser really is."
645,Great basecoat_This basecoat goes on easily and dries fast.  It protects my nails and keeps the Nails from drying out. Recommend .
1485,Love it_This product is amazing. It gives you a glow all the day. I used two times since i got it and i love it.
6220,"Nowhere near NUDE colored._This lipstick is definitely matte, so prep your lips before you wear it or all the cracks and stuff will be highlighted. It lasts all day and it goes on smooth. The only thing is....it's not NUDE. It is a pastel pink. Not even the whitest of white people have this color of lips naturally. I'm tanned so this is definitely not anywhere 'nude' for me. But its not an ugly color. I just would have liked to have gotten nude vs light baby pink."
6895,"Helpful and Realistically Priced_The best thing about this is the price.  I have to use a LOT of lotion so the fact that it was on the cheap side AND has a high quantity content is great.  The smell is also light so I don't feel like it over powers my high quality, designer perfume.  Great buy.  I dont really appreciate that this still has mineral oil in it (which isn't TOO terrible) but if you're looking for a more natural lotion that is also affordable, I'd go with something else like Everyday Shea Moisturizing Body Lotion.  Some of these lotions (I'm not sure if this is true for all of their scents) has a chemical preservative so it's not 100% natural but it's pretty close and pretty affordable."
3350,"Really like it!_I will probably buy another one of these in a few months when these should be replaced.  The bristles are not rough and, for all intents and purposes, it appears to be helping.  I bought it because I started breaking out on my back after being hit by a car.  It did help a little.  I added OxyClean to it and that made the condition worse.  I then used Phisoderm and that undid what the OxyClean did.  I'm now using it with a St. Ives salt body wash for my back.  It hasn't made it worse and in conjunction with the brush, it feels really good on my back."
1965,Love!_I use this every Sunday. Even got my husband to use it with me. We both really like it and you can't beat the price. This will last a long time. I prefer to use ACV with this rather than water. I can't last the whole time till it gets dry but I last about 15-20 minutes. My skin really likes this product. I have sensitive skin and so that's saying something. Don't be scared if you look like you got a sunburn after using this. It fades.
9281,"Really like these_I really enjoy stamping with these. I would have gave it 5 stars, but there are a few images that I can not get to stamp. Overall this is a great stamp set and I like it a lot."
9649,"High-quality, 100% pure argan oil_This is a very high quality, organic, cold-pressed oil from the kernel of the seed of the fruit of the Argania spinosa tree, native to Morocco. People who have not used it before immediately notice the very pale yellow color and the unique scent of natural argan oil, slightly sweet and rather nutty, with just a hint of earthiness.It comes in a 4 oz. blue glass bottle to protect it from the light, with a glass dropper attached to the cap. Just a few drops goes a long way. I have used several prescription topical sprays and ointments and many, many different kinds of oils, lotions, and salves, but I wish I had known about argan oil sooner. It quickly absorbs and locks in moisture, leaving the skin smooth and moist, and not at all greasy.Argan oil has made my dry, flaky skin look and feel much better with regular use, and it has even reduced the itching. It has also improved the appearance of my cuticles with regular use. Lately, I have been using it on the dry skin on my feet after I shower, and it softens it and eliminates that ashy appearance. I don't use it in my hair because my scalp isn't dry, but I have several friends who do.InstaNatural provided a sample of this 100% pure and organic argan oil for testing and unbiased review. I have enjoyed using it and highly recommend that others try it, too."
1827,"good perm_At the moment this is my perm of choice. When used with the Butter Blend Honey Shield and the Hair Bath Neutralizer my hair is left feeling very soft. (That's before I apply conditioner)Plus, buying a 30oz is cheaper then buying a box perm every 6 weeks"
6902,"Moisture Without Weight_I am not a fan of creamy shampoos, despite having dry hair.  The result is generally flat and clumpy.  Somehow, this Toni&Guy; shampoo didn't do that.  My hair is soft and not frizzy, while retaining a good amount of volume.  I also like the almost nonexistent smell, which is similar to other &#34;natural&#34; men's fragrances.  Finally, the way it opens is just cool.If you have hair that needs serious conditioning, this may not be the right product, but it works well for hair that is suffering from seasonal dryness without making it look like it was soaked in fabric softener."
3698,"not bad_I got this in the shade 'light' and it has peachy undertones so its great for my undereye circles. Its a mediocre concealer, good for its price; it dries quickly though."
4830,"Gorgeous_Absolutely gorgeous color, goes on nicely and last for 2 weeks.  Such a great color for Christmas and holiday time."
6684,"Worked GREAT._I didn't think I would like this stuff, as most spray-on sunscreen is garbage, but it worked GREAT.Firstly, I notice the cap has an arrow on it and 'twist to close' written on it.  That's awesome because there is no cap to this thing, so to keep it from accidentally spraying, you twist it to keep the button from being pushed down.  Nice idea - no cap to lose!Second, it sprays on in a super-fine mist so there's no clumps of sunscreen anywhere.  It just goes on so evenly.  It doesn't drip or anything.Third - it DOES feel really COOL when it hits your skin.  I thought that 'cool zone' thing was a joke but it does feel really nice especially after you've been in the heat for a bit!!!Fourth: It DOES keep you from getting burned.  I thought the super-fine mist wouldn't protect me, but I was in the direct sun for a few hours managing my numerous and belligerent nieces and nephews, and I didn't get burned at all!-I highly recommend this sunscreen.  It worked very well, it kept my hands from getting greasy which is a huge plus, and it's just a nice design overall.  I'll be buying this again for sure!"
5535,"AMAZING!_I cannot say enough good things about this product! I have very fine thin hair that i feel is weighted down by absolutely anything i put in my hair. This product didn't do that and I am so relieved! It leaves my hair so shiny and soft and smells delicious. My hair stylist used it on my hair the last time I went in and i loved it. I usually buy the products my hair stylist uses on my hair if she says she really likes it, but i've never really been all that gung-ho about the products once I buy them. I don't know if it's because I don't know how to use them properly or not, but this product is absolutely amazing. I gather my hair in a pony tail and spray seven sprays of it down to the ends. I rub it into the ends of my hair and kind of distribute it evenly throughout my hair. The only area I avoid putting it on is my roots; i feel this would make my hair feel greasy. There is definitely a &#34;too much&#34; with this product, but it is different for everyone. I would start off with a small amount and work your way up to the amount that is best suited for your hair. I would definitely recommend this product over any other leave in product!"
7401,Hair is sooo smooth!_I have done everything to my hair to damage it and almost everything to fix it. This stuff has been really helping. I use it before straightening but I also just use it on my dry hair almost every day. This along with coconut oil are slowly starting to improve my damaged locks.
3197,"My cure for acne_I've suffered from acne for years and tried everything from Proactiv to prescriptions from the dermatologist. I thought maybe it would be time to try a more natural approach since I also have sensitive, oily skin. I use this in conjuction with grape seed oil and lavander oil. Grape seed oil is a carrier oil and is also a great moisturizer that doesn't clog your pores. The lavander oil helps control sebum production. I use about 6 drops of grape seed oil with 2 drops each of tea tree oil and lavander oil. This has dramatically helped my skin and acne. My ance is almost gone, and the oil production is decreased. Before using essential oils, you should check out aromaweb.com. This site has a list of what each oil does, what you can and can't use it with, and oils to stay away from if you have certain conditions like high blood pressure. It's also good to talk to your doctor if you have any questions or concerns."
4160,"Swear by it!_I use this powder every day.  My coworkers think that my makeup looks very natural and goes with my skin tone.  (I am a Golden Medium in Bare Minerals if that helps.)  I use the little puff it comes with under my eyes, on my forehead, under my nose, and on my cheekbones for a little more coverage but it still doesn't look cakey.  I have used so many different powders but I am now use Amazon Subscribe & Save for this and the Neutrogena SkinClearing Foundation.  That's how good it is."
5849,"Ah-mazing product!! Best product for cellulite reduction!_A bit of background: I have had cellulite since I was a preteen and have tried nearly every method and cream and lotion to get rid of it with very little success. I recently started working out and making a shift to a healthier lifestyle in February 2013 but still felt like I needed that extra help. If you have done your research, you know that cellulite requires a varied plan of attack to even improve the condition, let alone rid yourself of it. My cellulite even after 5 months of clean eating and weight training had only improved from a stage 4 to a mild 3 at best. I kid you not, with the addition of Finulite and consistent dry brushing before every shower, I have no visible cellulite. I have never in my 27 years of life worn shorts in public until this summer... EVER. I was proud to wear shorts this year thanks to this product and a lot of hard work. It will definitely serve you well to make sure you are keeping your sugars and carbs to a minimum and eating the right foods, drinking plenty of water and getting a good multivitamin in every day. I also take a Lecithin supplement which has been known to reduce cellulite as well. All in all, yes I would, have and will continue to recommend this product to anyone looking to rid themselves of cellulite. It's so cheap compared to your alternatives, it has all the right ingredients and it works just as described. Do no hesitate to buy!!!"
6608,"Works good excellent soap inside_Not too much to say, the hardware works well, the soap inside is excellent and smells nice and citrusy. My only 'minor' issue is finding refills as we live in a small town and nobody carrys it here, however we frequently travel a small distance to a larger city for medical reasons and the stores there have refills."
7542,:)_The description says tiny and they do mean tiny. Do not expect decent size designs. The product is great and I would definitely buy it again.
1117,"Murad skin perfecting lotion ,3, hydrate/protect. 1.7 fl oz_I am very please with this product.  My skin is looking good.  I use it twice a day and under make-up.  There is a tightening process that makes my face feel softer.  I was disappointed in my old cream for wrinkles. Did a lot of research for something new and Murad was it."
2918,"Excellent soap for dry skin_Ivory has always been a reliable bar soap, but as I've gotten older, I've noticed that my skin tends to be drier.  The low humidity has been especially bad this winter, so I have been using Dove body wash and bars with shea butter or plum and sakura blossom fragrance and have found that they are not so drying to the skin.The Dove White is the basic Dove bar with the usual mild, sweet, powdery fragrance, very similar to Ivory, but with moisturizing cream added.I like to unwrap the bars and put them in the dresser drawers for scent and find that the bars harden a bit and last much longer in the shower after aging a few months and that the scent is then less obtrusive when bathing, as well."
6280,"Bar soap smell_While you're showering this doesn't have much of a smell, however this soap does smell throughout the house, which I was disappointed with. It is not as strong as other bar soap smells (the smell that lingers through your house AFTER you shower) but like I said, it does smell abit. Good soap overall."
2423,Love it_I am pleased with this. I haven't ordered from another manufacturer so I can't compare it. But was very satisfied.
1390,"Very durable, and holds a ton!_I received this as a gift several years ago now, and it is still in almost new condition. The case comes with several plastic dividers, and all four of the shelves are lined, so you can divide the shelves as you desire. Right now I have nail polish on the three of the shelves, and then tons of eye shadow on the fourth shelf. Then I have various makeup, nail and hair products in the bottom area. There is a lot of room between the shelves and the bottom area, so large items can fit, standing straight up; plus the bottom area has several different padded areas for additional organization. I love this box so much, my friends sometimes make fun of me because they think that it looks like I'm a professional makeup artist, but I don't use it as my daily makeup container - I use it to hold and organize all the beauty products I have that I do not use on a daily basis and it does the job perfectly. The case is incredibly well made and durable-it seriously looks like a professional case. I actually have seen the makeup artists at Sephora use the same case. It can become heavy when it's filled, but perhaps I just have too much stuff :)I've read some of the other reviews, and I don't know if I was given a different case than they were, but I haven't had any of the problems anyone else has mentioned. If you look at the first member photo, where you can see the bottom padded area, that is exactly what my case looks like, except of course that it is primarily black, not silver. But like I said, I have had this case for many years now, and nothing is falling apart..."
808,Try it_I have very sensitive skin and it works perfectly on it. I use it on my face and body. Will be ordering another bottle soon since i am getting help using it lol.
196,"Creates smooth, soft waves_This curling iron is perfect for creating big, soft waves on my shoulder length hair. You can adjust the heat settings and get it pretty hot if you have harder to curl hair. I really like how it smoothes out the frizzies as it curls, so my hair is wavy and smooth.  Because the barrel is so big, the curls aren't tight at all and I like that for a more casual look.  I'm really happy because it gives me nice hair without looking overly 'fixed.'"
8608,"AWESOME QUALITY_I was pleasantly surprised at how well this cream moisturizes, you won't find anything close for the money.... I will be buying again!"
7790,"Awesome!_This stuff is really really great, it is very thick and moisturizing and I can definitely tell a noticeable difference in my skin!"
8486,"There's Gum in My Hair!_In terms of how this smells in comparison to most Axe products, there isn't much of a smell. It is a good styling gel and holds my husband's hair in place. It easily lasts through the day."
3676,"Love it!_This foundation is awesome!! such good coverage and I love that they have olive tones. It is PERFECT for olive skinned people like me. Every foundation I get have a different undertones than mine, but not this. I apply it with a beauty blender sponge and it goes on very smoothly."
148,"Hate it!_I have been trying to develop a skin care routine and was looking for a good moisturizer.  I have oily acne prone skin and this made my skin burn and break out even worse.  My face is red and dry now because of this.  Cystic acne is not fun to deal with and this brought out too many cysts around my chin and cheeks.  My face was doing great, clearing up before this.  Waste of my money, but I guess it's all about trial and error.  I take my time when adding a new product to my skincare routine so that I know if its going to break me out or not,"
7920,"perfect_little colored blings for your nails looks great applied, take a while to get to you, but for the price its worth the wait"
9811,"I'm in love with this Argan Oil!_So far I really love this Argan Oil. I've been interested in learning more about the benefits of using Argan Oil and who knew it had so many uses! It's working wonders on my dry, cracked skin and I even use it to tame fly aways in my hair. It's also nice to know that I'm using an organic product on my body. Thanks for the great product."
8478,"For my son_I'm too old for the spiked look , but it looks great on my son. His hair isn't all that long , but this Axe spiking glue does a great job of holding his hair in place all day long.Inexpensive as compared to similar products on the market , I'm glad Axe added this to their already great product line.My son says that a very little goes a very long way , so the bottle will be an even greater value."
1521,A Must Have For All Stampers_Everyone who stamps needs to at least experience stamping with Konad's Black and White Polish. Fabulous. Shows up on nails great.
4453,Great lip stain_CoverGirl Outlast Lip stain has disappeared from my local area. I was so happy to find it for sale on Amazon. The Nude Kiss 427 is a natural tone on me. I apply it followed with a lip balm to moisturize. Love it!
433,"Excellent Face Wash, No Harmfull chemicals_I love that they offer this product in a bulky refill size.  Of course, you could use the product just as it is, but I like to refill my small pump bottles with it.This face wash contains tea tree oil, which is a natural antibacterial that is excellent at clearing up acne.  It also contains other all natural ingredients that work great together.  I love how clean this leaves my face, and yet it doesn't not strip it.  I have very oily skin and am prone to break outs, my skin is practically pimple free now.  I've used proactiv in the past and in my opinion this stuff is better, and yet costs significantly less.Best of all, I like that this product does not contain any potentially cancer causing ingredients such as: propylenes, parabens and sulfates.  I think that ridding my skin of those chemicals has done a lot to keep it in balance.  I highly recommend this product!"
3278,Ok_Not to bad nice to have an assortment none have broken and it use them every day and they are pretty durable
597,Good support system_Taken daily it helps me keep my bowels regulated.  It is a good pro biotic and was recommended by my doctor.
3865,"Junk_Waste of money. If I could have given it a zero, I would have!"
9320,"A Surprise Favorite_I've spent over $20 on the Sara Happ lip exfoliator and now I'm sad I did that because this product is so much more superior. Its everything I've wanted out of a exfoliator - logical packaging, natural ingredients, and grit. I love that it is packaged in lipstick form because you can use it from the tube and make circular motions on your lips. It doesn't fall apart on your lips and does have enough hold in the product to keep it together. When you first get it, you will have to use a bit to get down to the sugar part so don't immediately think its too slick to work as an exfoliator."
9412,"Good scent, some brightening_I like this product because it has a really great smell for a moisturizing cream - it's not too strong, just light and airy, and it appeals to me personally.  I did notice some brightening, evening effects - while not a &#34;miracle worker,&#34; definite improvement."
8944,"Almost Perfect_Absolutely beautiful. Takes a while to get here as it comes from Asia, but worth the wait. Well packaged and in good condition. Definitely recommend. There was a tiny chip on one of the blue gems, that I noticed on closer inspection, which was the only drawback. Doesn't change my rating, I still give it 5 stars."
8644,"Cleans it, heals it_This new Clearasil gel contains the typical acne solution - 2% salicylic acid.  My wife and I  are well passed puberty.  In fact, we have a kid that is already pubertized.  But he doesn't need it, his skin is like a Japanese doll. I on the other hand gets  it mostly inside the nose while my wife gets it on her back.  Occasionaly a zit will sit on the tip of my nose.  When my wife gets it, she let me rub a piece of cotton with Clearasil on her back.  It helps her relieve the itch, cleans it and expedite the healing.  For me, I use it around my nose and cheek to treat and sanitize this area.  My only beef  with this product is that it leaves the skin somewhat dry."
384,Love it!_This is a product I have been using for years and love the light weight foundation powder. It always leaves my skin clear and hides any imperfections. You really cannot beat the price either.
1373,"Warning!  Hidden Danger to eyes._I bought this product locally but my experience was SO VERY severe that I thought I would warn others.  I am an adult and obviously I've been washing my face my entire life,  so it is fair to say I know how to do it.  Every now and then when we as people shower, wash our face or hair a little bit of product may get in one's eyes.  It is not a common or regular occurence, but if this happens, people generally expect a little sting and then after flushing out the eyes with water, relief should follow.  That was NOT my experience.I had been using the product for about one year and a half without incident but one day, for the first time, I accidentally got some in my eyes--it rinsed down from my forehead in the shower.  My eyes began burning so I tried to rinse them using the shower.  The burning merely increased and it got to the point where I could barely see and the scratchiness from the beads was preventing me from being able to move my eyes to even look side to side.  The beads would NOT rinse out and were lodged under my lids.  I was afraid I was going blind.  It was so severe that I needed an ambulance and the paramedics worked quickly and diligently to get the foaming beads out of my eyes--foam was leaking from my eyes--I literally could not see.  I was then brought to the hospital to make sure there was no permanent injury to my cornea.  The chemicals in the face cleanser made it so that my eyes would not produce tears for 2 weeks--I had to use artificial tears to moisten my eyes and the surrounding skin itched like hell.  Thankfully, I suffered no permanent damage.If this stuff gets into your eyes, DO NOT splash in the sink and DO NOT try to flush it out in the shower.  It could lodge the beads under your lids (like it did to me).  The paramedics had to lay me down on my back and gently pour cold water from the inner corner to flush my eyes out--one eye at a time with my head turned to the side.  They explained that the harder I tried to get the product out of my eyes, the further under the lid the crystals became lodged--and the salicylic acid made it a burning nightmare.  I could have gotten any product in my eyes, but this product will NOT dissolve and exit your eyes easily without assistance.It was a bizarre accident, but a lesson I wouldn't want anyone else to learn the hard way.  Be very careful if you insist on using this product...your eyesight is at risk if things go wrong."
6040,"pretty cool stuff_its basically like hair in a bottle, I like how it makes my eyelashes longer and it doesn't sill all over my face all day or anything, I just follow the directions and it seals it in. One tip though apply only to tips of lashes not roots as it can get bulky and too close to your eye which could irritate it"
6676,"Hawaiian Tropic_I LOVED HOW IT LEFT MY SKIN FEELING LUXURIOUS AND HYDRATED.IT SMELLED SO GOOD AND NOT TO HEAVY VERY GOOD PRODUCT FOR SUMMER TIME,BUT YOU CAN WEAR IT WHEN EVER YOU LIKE.PROTECTS MUCH LONGER THAN REGULAR SUNSCREEN LOTIONS AND IT MADE ME FEEL PAMPERED AND BEAUTIFUL WITH MY SUMMER TAN."
1259,"Great nightly moisturizer_I've been a Clinique girl for many years, until my local store went out of business.  After trying several other brands, I landed on the L'Oreal RevitaLift cream.  I love it!  First of all, it does not have much of a fragrance. I have sensitive skin and this has never irritated my face. It's a thick cream that really does seem to keep my face moisturized well into the next morning (I apply it at night).  I'm not certain of its wrinkle-fighting potential as I just hit 30, but based on the hydration, I imagine it would work very well to smooth out wrinkles. Hopefully it will hold mine at bay a while longer!Amazon's price is actually a little less than buying this locally, which I also love.  One jar lasts me about 30 days, so it's a great value as well.Overall, highly recommended."
1647,"PCA skin care_I refer to this as my glue to help keep my make-up on during the day.  I have very oily skin and by the end of the day my makeup would be gone.  I am not the type to reapply makeup during the day.  I have tried other products and none has ever worked like this product.  My pores do not get clogged.  The PCA skin line is the BEST on the market.  Buy, buy, buy it for fabulous skin."
3475,"amazing eyelashes_I love these false eyelashes! they are very natural looking and very easy to apply too. It didn't feel very heavy on your eyes too, which is a good thing. I will continue to purchase this in the future"
2885,"For hair, face, me_well, I haven't tried other brands but this smells great and feels great. I bought it to add to a hair spritz recipe. In the meantime I notice my face and neck are ..nicer, softer. This is a great price - I paid over 8 dollars for 1 at a local health store. So the recipe is veggie glycerin, rosewater and aloe vera juice (not gel).  The rosewater makes the spritz pleasant to use - far better than using water as I had been. My hair - and face - really like this spritz. I see no down sides."
141,"Great price!_The product is wonderful. I have combination skin and this moisturizer is wonderful, it doesn't over-moisturize. The price on Amazon is great and you pay no taxes...great buy will likely continue to buy through Amazon."
7678,Lovin My Skin!_These are a lovely practical value. Easy to use..no loud smelling perfume stuff (yay!). I try to avoid products that clash loudly with my perfume. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five was I had to go find a empty container to store it in after opening it. Would I buy it again? Yes. It was worth getting up for a container for. lol. Good product at a fair price.
1732,My daily moisturizer_This is a great moisturizer. Im not sure how well it works against wrinkles but it does make my face feel more firm. Its also not greasy or oily so it great to use under makeup. It comes in a large jar that will last a long time
1467,"One of the best scents I've ever bought!_Love Potion Red is one of the first perfumes I bought (several years ago)from Love Potion Magickal Perfumerie, and to this day is still one of my favorites. Not to mention my husband's ;) The vanilla,dark sugars,amber and cinnamon mix to make this a sweet and sexy scent. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a sensual scent that will capture attention!"
562,"Nice_I must say that this brush is extremely soft.  It is very good for my edges, but I can't say the same about the rest of my (very curly) hair."
2037,"Good stuff_Great stuff. Just really strong coffee smell, may be pleasant to some. I see a difference in my eyes in the morning. I would recommend this product to others."
3468,Absolutely great product and reasonable price._You will love this...and it comes at a great price. Boots really is a great product so everyone should try it.
1702,"Ordered 5, Great New Condition, Quality product, Great Colors_My daughter and I are hard to match, she is extremely pale and the Alabaster looks great on her without looking white like a ghost.  I tend to be greenish ( I was told)  and I find the C2 to be perfect with it's very faint pink cast.  I have never found such a color in any other line.  It is very flattering.  We are both very happy.  We have both gone to pricier brands - but always come back to L'oreal True Match."
7375,Get it._Holy moly. I can literally use the cheapest drug store foundation there is and this brush will still blend it in flawless on my skin. I love using this with my Sephora foundation. This brush is a steal. Don't waste your money on expensive brushes.
7102,"AhAhAhAh MAZING!_I love this peel, it is sincerely amazing. I want to 'second' the other reviewer who says this is a SERIOUS peel even though you may be thrown off by the fact that it is derived from fruits. (well, weren't we all ;0).I recently did a 'buffered 70% glycolic' at a spa and I find this to be far more effective for far less money. I used the Pineapple Pumpkin Enzyme Peel for UNDER two minutes and WOWZERS, this bad boy works! I am a veteran of skin peels, microdermabrasion, and multitudes of other treatments and this is one of the best. I STRONGLY encourage you to try this peel and to NOT leave it on longer then TWO minutes the first time. I'm tough when it comes to peels and this would have done some damage if I would have left it on for over 5 minutes - just try it in increments. I'm so thankful I limited myself to this because when I 'washed' the peel off my face SKIN (old dead skin mind you!) was coming off too and not in miniscule amounts- this is no joke.I was feeling like just about every pore on my face was congested and only one use of this product has made my pores look smaller. I'm hopeful that with weekly use my skin will start getting that beautiful porcelain glow I see on some women.I'm finding it VERY difficult to believe anyone who says they had no results - I just cannot imagine it."
6271,"amazoholic_This product is amazing, both me and my friend bought this and don't have to go to the salon no more!!!! lol saves time and money!!!!! i recommend getting this with  the MASH Double Sided Nail Art Plate Stamp and Scraper."
5675,Tree Hut Shea Extra Rich Moisturizing Lotion_It feels and smells good as well. It seems to have a very soothing effect on my skin and after a shower I feel like I am putting on the finishing touches.
4049,NOT as pink as it looks in picture...JUST purples._Picture made this look more PINK than purples...in person..too much purple for my PINK self. I bought this expecting it to look like pictures even though it says lilac it looked pink. WRONG.
1701,"love it!_It's great, great coverage, lasts lots of time, looks awesome and great price too! and the best part, you can actually find the most accurate shade in this line =D"
6654,"Perfect for beginners_My hunny got me thus at Walmart cuz I mentioned that I wanted to try nail stamping. After a little practice I got the hang of it. THIS KIT DIES WORK!! those who say it doesn't are doing sorting wrong or not using the right polish. Do some research about which non.stamping polishes to use if u don't want to use konad. I use the stamper, scraper (even tho it scratches the plates but all scrapers do), and the holder with my other stamping plates. The stamper works with other plates too. This is perfect for someone who is interested in nail stamping but doesn't want to spend the mines on sets of plates and accessories. These images are very simple and the full nail designs are a but too small."
9369,feels great!_The texture is light and fluffy.  It feels good on your skin but I don't like the smell.  It's not bad I just don't like it.
1604,Best I've found so far_I wish this stuff lasted a little longer. By the end of the day it's mostly gone. That said though I haven't found anything better. Most things with longer staying power don't blend as well as this. This smudges and blends really well and the color is perfect. Enough to give some definition but much less harsh than black. I have blue eyes and this works well to bring them out. The built in smudger is great also.
6794,"Bigger than I thought_These rhinestones are nice, but they're a little bigger than I thought they would be. The 1.5 mm is good for single stones, but are a little too big for intricate designs on my hands.  I can, however, use them on my toes."
3301,"Perfect_For sure get it,one of the best curling iron ever i had.i like it very much, and i recommend it."
7900,E.l.f. Makes great products_I have ordered multiple items and have been very pleasantly surprised with the quality for the price. Thick quality brush does a great job. This will last me for years. Very happy.
7086,Works really good on acrylic or nature nails_Works really good on acrylic or nature nails. Love the bits that came along with this product. Can't seem to go back to using a regular file now that I have this drill.
9011,Love this_I love this color. The formula is great too. I usually use Shellac and rarely use regular nail polish but I couldn't resist this color. It has great staying power!!!  Highly recommend.
2903,Excellent Relief_I love this mask. It just lightly cools all the right places during a migraine (for me). It contours to your face and doesn't add pressure. However it doesn't stay cold very long. But worth it for the relief it does give.
9846,"Skip it_Really just a blowdryer/roundbrush re-imagined. Having used a roundbrush and blowdryer for years to make loose, large curls I still gave it a try. The curlers simple release and hang mid-length as they have no clips to secure them. This places weight on the roots but no lift. Curls are lifeless."
5295,"Love it...IT WORKS._To the point...I am 36 yrs old, t-zone oily, breakout sometimes, inflammation on cheeks, and crows feet. I could never stick to any so called anti-aging products because they are all mostly fluff and did nothing to me but empty my pocket book. It is nice to have a trusted name brand at a very reasonable price that works in just days. I paid only $16 for the Day and the Night at Walgreens since they had it on sale!This stuff...Calms inflammed skinVery well absorbedFresh spring-like fragrance (I LOVE!)Leaves a glowDoes make the lines and skin softer after using for a few daysSPF 30 does the jobFeels greatThis has replaced my Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Sunblock SPF 100 as my daily sunblock since it is a lot lighter on my face and does SO MUCH more!"
1525,"Great brand for stamping_I've tried several withe color from different brands and konad white is exactly what i was looking for, love it... best white nail polish to do stamping."
1256,"Wow, very good stuff_Like it a lot, will keep using it.  I see a difference. May go ahead and buy the facial cream as well."
5097,Fit me! Powder_I like this powder. Not as much coverage as I thought it would have but is still a very good product. I use it instead of liquid foundation on most days and is a good light powder. I then put bronzer over it and sometimes some blush.
272,Just in Time for Easter_Love this purple color.  Goes on smooth and very jewel-like.  Very happy with coverage and with shade of purple.  Would highly recommend.
7317,"good anti-dandruff shampoo_This anti-dandruff shampoo contains Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%), which is the same anti-dandruff ingredient found in Head and Shoulders shampoos. Head and Shoulders is the shampoo my family (husband and sons) have been using for the past several years. They tried this line of anti-dandruff products and have had good results so far. My son says he prefers this line over Head and Shoulders because they smell better. They are lightly scented and I find that they are similar to the scent of the non anti-dandruff line we have tried from Clear. Overall, this is a good anti-dandruff shampoo and I would recommend it."
8929,"Great_These are cute jewelry ,especially considering the price.Way better than any bubble gum stuff.They really look like hello kitty.That darn cat, i love her so."
61,looks really pretty online_but once I got it it looked reddish so I couldn't use it - beware buying dye since when I tried to return itit came up as &#34;hazardous waste&#34; material and not returnable.  I have several of these colors now I have to throw out.
5668,Great!_I loved these so much I had to buy a set for my mom. They make perfect dots for your nails and are super easy to do even on yourself!
1260,"great product professional Results_great product professional ResultsI have very long hair, down to my waist and I am 5'8''. I used to go to the salon and pay $300+ for highlights before a cut. After the second time of two different salons messing up my hair, I turned to this after It was recommend to me. Believe it or not, it looks better then the salon. Always great results the cap ensures that you can't mess it up. Be sure to comb you hair to the part where it falls naturally before putting the cap on. Also conb through all tangels before. I never use up all of the product, and my hair is very long. Make sure you wear the gloves and wear just a bra or old teeshirt. IT WILL BLEACH A GOOD SHIRT OR TOWEL! (I learned that one the hard way)I pull more hairs on the part and though out all the way to the middle back of my head the bottom of my hair stays my 'natural' color and my top has golden caramel to blonde high lights through out. I do this my self with a few mirrors. I use the smaller metal pull for more natural look the other one will give you a 'chunky look.' I have people ask me who my stylist is.  My natural color is a ash brown, to blonde. Watch the color as you process it not to over process. And when you re color DO NOT re highlight the tips that are already blonde, or you can fry your hair. Just do the roots. The avoid pain when removing the cap get into the shower rinse dye out. Then take a hand full of your own good conditioner ( I use Redkin so-soft) While the conditioner is still in slowly wiggle off the cap. once off shampoo and condition hair again. Then I put the toner in once hair is combed and out of the shower. Then Style your way.I have been coloring my hair with this product every 3 months for the last four years.Over all the money I have saved through out the years. Probably close to $1,200 a year!! My natural color is a ash brown, to blonde. I have been coloring my hair with this product every 3 months for the last four years"
2079,"love it smell and everything._One of my best purchases had it before and bought again, cheap and smells soooo good does exactly what it says will always use this if just even for lotion. Best ever."
1731,"Good face cream_I use this every day.  It's a light face cream and it is not expensive.  It doesn't  have the texture of an Olay cream, but then it's three times less expensive"
6029,"Awful_Bad quality, useless and its stuck in my hair. Too difficult to use. Im not recommending it at all,and its a waste of money."
5509,"I love it_I love it product. My hair is softer, shinier, and I can easily see the color after just two applications. It will leave your hair a little dry after (like a day or so) but it is sooo worth it."
1465,"Light, non-greasy feel and with medium to full coverage.._I have been using glominerals products for 4 years, and gloCamouflage is now on my list of must haves. I am a fair complected, (medium-toned) natural blonde, but change my hair color often (platinum, black, red and every shade in between), and Golden works great with all of my looks!"
1801,"Great item!_I purchased ths item to use on my elbows and knees, yes I've notice a big difference after just two weeks of using it. Only down side to ths item is that it seems strong so I use another moisturizer with this cream."
329,"Will never purchase again!_Dryer does not dry my hair well at all.  I can sit under it a full hour, and my hair in some sections will still be dripping wet.  Total waste of money."
7688,"Not your grandma's face cream anymore_PONDS has a long tradition of offering gentle and effective facial cleansing creams.  My grandma used her jar of cold cream for decades and had the smoothest, softest skin for anyone in their golden years.  Today, since there are so many choices on the shelves, it's not always easy to find something new and trust that it won't irritate your skin.  Ponds is still a trusted name even with new versions of their products.  This daily cleanser squeezes out from a tube like toothpaste, is glossy white with scrubbing flecks, and is lightly fragrant.  The very fine granual feels nice on your skin when gently rubbed in, and it washes off fully.  My face is left very soft and smooth, which I love, and there are no dry patches after I towel off.  The only negative, and it's not really too terrible, is that I would prefer it had a bit more lathering element to it, since even with a generous amount on the face and enough water, there is really not much suds working.  I like to see the foamy soap while I wash off the day's grime, it somehow makes me feel like I'm really getting the cleanest, freshest face possible before bed.  Otherwise, I am satisfied with this product and would recommend it for all types of skin, even those with more sensitive cleansing needs."
6934,"Cheeky XL 2012 Nail Art Plates_The stamps are very intricate as I wanted. Unless it's my imagination there is more time to get everything lined up, in other words the polish doesn't seem to dry as quickly. I love the attention to detail, and I would 100% recommend them to another nail enthusiast!"
7895,"aggravated_worst productas soon as you put the caviar nails the start bleeding the colors of the beads are so tiny you can barely see it , you need a toothpick to try and put them on these are the worst products ever invented I won't my recommend this unless you're an expert they look nice in the picture but don't let that picture deceive you believe me...I wouldn't recommend I'm sorry but I'm only telling the truth"
4965,Not bad_It has a good consistency and covers well. You may need two coats though. It also started chipping the next day after I put it on.
9593,"My hair is noticeably smoother_I like Tresemme products so was intrigued to try this new formula.  It has made my hair slightly more noticeably smoother, although I live in such a dry climate that's its hard to completely get away from the little frizzy summer hair.  This has a nice, soft scent and even my boyfriend uses it and likes it.  I may get different results if paired with the conditioner, but I have a huge bottle of Tresemme Naturals conditioner, which I like and that seems to pair nicely with this.However, the shipping of this leaves much to be desired.  other products I have purchased online that come in a tube like this have been shrink wrapped.  I used to think that was an extra pain to opening the tube, but when I got this I suddenly saw the advantage to a little extra wrapping on the tube.  The &#34;box&#34; that it was shipped in was one of those thin, cardboard wrap boxes that Amazon often uses for books.  It didn't work out too well with the US Postal Service for this item. the box got squished, the shampoo leaked out, and the postal service had it wrapped in a plastic bag when it arrived.  I think I lost at least 1/3 of the shampoo with that little debacle."
8285,"Works well, seems to protect colored hair_As I've said in other reviews of products like this, I usually find most soaps and shampoos are about the same; I've tried very few that I really didn't like.  That said, I do think that Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Shampoo (like theSuave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine ShampooI reviewed a few days ago) is better than a lot of shampoos I've used before. This product cleans well, and it seems as though my hair had a bit more body and fullness after using it than before.I don't color my hair (happy to be slowly going gray) but my wife does; after trying this shampoo for several days she is also pleased with it.  She found that it seemed to protect her hair coloring as advertised, and also imparted some additional fullness and shine to her hair.I'll add that there no no dramatic scent to these Moroccan Infusion shampoos; if anything there is a certain nutty scent, but this is very subtle and I'm would not expect you to notice this fragrance in your hair after use."
9885,"Great on my ultra sensitive skin!_For the past two years, I've been usingBoudreaux's Butt Baby Bathon my ultra sensitive skin, and I've had good luck with it -- until last month.  The only thing that I could use started irritating my skin, causing severe itching and an ugly red rash.This CeraVe was just what the doctor ordered, and I can once again cleanse myself without leaving my skin in ruins.  It does a good job of cleaning my body and my hair, and the itching is gone.  I heartily recommend this baby wash and shampoo for babies and adults with sensitive skin."
7781,Samira Nail's_I love this little bow my custumers love it too. I do recomend to have available in your shop for your custumers.
2063,"My new favorite_My new favorite every day cream for winter. Great for my face in the AM (though not before working out) and in the PM. Love the smell and the feel of it. Not greasy at all, but good moisture for my 50ish skin. Nice product!"
4970,"Love this perfume_Fast shipping. The perfume is great, everywhere I go people ask what perfume I have on. If you are looking for a perfume that lasts long, this is the one for you."
2061,Great price and product_Great facial cleanser. No soap good clean ingredients. I Will repurchase. Also purchased their coconut version.  Like that too :)
880,"Awesome Product_This shampoo and especially the conditioner are the best I've used.  I have Paul Mitchell and Matrix products, and Loreal nature's Therapy makes my hair feel so much softer.  Not to mention also cheaper.  My husband tried it and he also loves it.  Both our hair shine like never before.  I have not used anything but Loreal Nature's Therapy ever since I tried it.  You must buy the conditioner as this is what really makes your hair soft.  It is always good to use the same shampoo and conditioner for maximum results,so I highly recommend both."
2993,"Love Love Love_I like mascara that stays and does not run.  I tried this because it was in the Bare Naturale line, going greener, and I love it. It stays and comes off much easier than my previous long-wear mascaras.  I love how full and natural my eyelashes look. No clumps."
9006,"lllllooovvveeee_I am in love with this color and texture I am a amateur self taught nail artist I've been dying to get my hands on the liquid sand versions of opi, I'm hooked and can't wait to order more (since my sallys doesn't sell them) I got this and honey ryder and love them instantly"
7095,Love it_Works wonders on my dark spots. At first I couldnt leave this product on for longer then 1min due to the heavy irritation and burning. After 2-3 uses I was able to leave on for 3mins. 5-6 times later I was able to leave on my skin for 5-8mins without irritation or burning my skin. After each use I netralize my skin with cool water and baking soda. It stops the burning and process immediately. 2nd I either use my dark spot corrector lotions or I may do a light microdermabrasion with my Kendal set. My dark spots and skin texture have improved extremely.
5983,Soaking off doesn't stop life_Absolutely a must have item. I use this with my gelish products and can do chores or whatever while I'm soaking off product without difficulty
6560,"This is a FAB product!_Got a large sample of this and used it about three times.  Every time I looked in the mirror I noticed my hair looked fuller and shinier.  Just bought the large tube, so I'm sold on this."
8519,"Pretty Standard_I usually use Pert Plus, and even though I know it is just cheap and easy, I've come to be used to how it feels.  When I use other shampoos at hotels, my hair feels a little harder and possibly more tangled.  This Dove 2-in-1 did a pretty comparable job to the Pert Plus:  my hair felt a little harder and looked a little darker at first, but an hour later each day it feels the same as always.  The only other difference is the smell.  The Dove smells like the ubiquitous men's smell, which I'm not a big fan of, but it doesn't last very long."
8499,"Pick up, spray, brush and go!_With so many power outages and water shortages this winter I was in desperate need for a dry shampoo. Not so easy to find these days, a dry shampoo can be quite useful when someone is sick or wounded and unable to shower. Well, say hello to Axe! - famous for the scent that drives men and women wild, how handy it is to be able to pick up, spray, brush and go, and still have your hair smell terrific! I'm so glad I found this on amazon.com!"
1173,"WORTH THE HYPE_It is exactly what i hoped for and better. makes my makeup look flawless. i have tried everything expensive brushes, sponges, triangles, air brushing - everything! this thing does the job and keeps the skin looking flawless. loves it!!"
78,exactly what im looking for_have been looking for the perfect nude lipstick that offer higher pigmentation for dark olive/tanned skin. this lipstick does not disappoint- matte with a sheer finish. a great match for a smoky eye!
4015,"Very Good_After reading a few reviews, I decided to give it a try.One of the reviews did a comparison in price/brands, and I figured, before spending money on one that's expensive, let me work myself through the price pyramid.  I don't regret it and it has lasted me about a month, I only spray a tid bit as it doesn't require so much, I usually just spray it on the top middle portion of my headm which is usually where we all heat up the most.When you comb the product through the rest of your hair it still absorbs the moisture and extra grease you may have from any serum you wear, but it leaves it soft, so I am usually able to wear my hair out an additional 2 days.  I recommend this product as well."
2193,"Ancestors were Correct_Scratch all those products with empty claims. You don't really need them...this coming from a 'product junkie.' I have tried it All with minimal results. Let's go back to simpler times. This oil makes my skin glow. It Does heal damaged skin. I've just ordered a cold press organic version..here on Amazon. It is more pure than this one (#4stars), but even this one...Made me a believer. At nite and under makeup...I'm just in Awe. FYI: AAF"
891,"Nice quality wax_I love this wax.  It smells great, dissolves easy, and leaves a nice soft, silky feel to the skin after using it.  A great product to use."
8835,"Ugh..._Number one reason I don't like this product is that it breaks me out! This is the 3rd day I've used it and my faceis all clogged up! I had finally gotten my skin down to NO blemishes and just all of my acne scars and now BAM all this acne. SO angry and disappointed. To be quite honest, I've hated every face product by Nyx that I've ever tried. They make great lip products but nothing else works for me. I will be throwing this out, total waste of 8 bucks.Oh and also this has a very strange smell, not pleasant at all."
3406,"Hmmm!  Infusionably delicious!_I'm a moisturizer junkie.  My skin's always dry, and I need moisturizers that feel good, aren't greasy, and actually work.  Surprisingly difficult list.  But this stuff not only works and works well, it's not greasy.  I keep it by my computer because I can put it on -- then use my keyboard without gunking up the works.  Yoo hoo.  What do the minerals add?  No idea.  But I'm less interested in why it works -- then the actual fact of it working."
6842,Definitly NOT ambergris!!!_Definitely NOT ambergris!!!  This stuff smells like frankincense.  I do not like the scent at all.  What a waste of $20.00.  Will not buy from madini again.
2005,"Been using them for YEARS._I love these!  It's the easiest way to remove makeup and not leave an oily coating on your eyeballs where you have to wait 20 minutes to see clearly.Honestly, the OIL that they sell for eye makeup removal is insanity! I get that it works - as in, it does remove the eye makeup... But, so do these!!!And you don't need to get cotton balls/circles/etc... to apply them to - *they're ready to go as they are*, and they DON'T burn your eyes (like some generic versions do) nor do they get in there and make your vision blurry by coating your irises with oil!HIGHLY recommended! Best option for removing ALL makeup - including waterproof mascara."
4487,"LOVE IT!_I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE  THIS PRODUCT. ITS A NICE SHADE OF PINK.  IT ADDS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF COLOR TO YOUR LIPS."
5637,Had for awhile and still like new_this is well worth the reasonable price... well made... holding up really well... definitely recommend this for purchase... would buy again
3702,very nice bag_I love the fact my order arrived before expected  delivery. I love the material this case is made out of and i love the style of the bag. it's very roomy inside and even has a clear zipper pouch inside to store more cosmetics. this was a good buy.
2866,I Love it!_Burt's Bees Naturall Ageless Eye Creme is wonderful I use it daily and works especially well on my sensitive eyes.
6300,Not bad_Not much to say about these nail drill bits as they are inexpensive but for the money you can't go wrong!
6400,I love_the lip brush is excellent quality leaves a beautiful finish I use it every day I love Thank you very much
2021,"Is this a perm?_After hearing many great things about this product, I decided to give it a go. It was cheap -- a dollar cheaper than what I usually use -- which was a pro for me. I took it home, opened it up, and...wow. The smell was awful. It is very medicinal. However, I decided that maybe the scent would wear off once I rinsed and my hair dried. I shampooed, and on my newly clean hair I applied this. My scalp began to tingle. I looked on the label, but could not find anything that I recognized to be medicinal. The tingling continued, until it began to feel like a perm that was in too long. I rinsed it out.After rinsing, my hair texture did change some. To its credit, my hair was a bit frizzy from another product I used, and this greatly reduced the frizz and smoothed out my curls. However, the tingling got WORSE. I went to bed and the scent was still there, and on day two, I still smell vaguely like mothballs. My scalp itches and is still somewhat tender.This is definitely not for sensitive scalps. Will not be using again."
943,DON'T BYE IT YOU WILL CRY!!!_I GOT THIS AND TELL YOU THE HONEST FACT . IN THE SOME AREA'S IT TURNED MY HAIR PURPLE.. iT MAKES IT MORE ORANGY!!Get the nice in easy light ash blonde and you will loose yellow-orange-brassy color go away for good.. I did!! I am shocked how that hair color works. Made my hair soft too. you will thank me if you do this.. We all want to be blonde not a lemon head right!! or oh my your hair is orange.. I will never use anything else diffrent. great beautiful blonde!!!!good luck all.
7203,buy it._not much to say. this pallet is an essential neutral collection. sparkly smoky and awesome. super long wear with the primer they sell.
2534,"What it says it is._I was very disappointed with this. It's what they say they are. But for 99 cents, was good. But I didn't expect to wait about two or so months for it. I would have just gone out to the local hair place,and spent more money to get them soon. Happens,I guess.."
4581,Hyaluronic Acid Serum is some pretty wonderful stuff!_This is a great product and I loved doing business with this seller.  This is great to add to your skin care products or to use alone. Highly recommend it.
4103,Great liner_The price is fabulous for what you get: gel and applicator brush.  I like it and it stays put all day.  It took me awhile to learn to apply... weeks actually.  It takes practice.  Now I can apply quickly and accurately.
3277,"Nice variety_Nice variety of combs from a good brand and at nice cheap price! I use combs a lot, (dont like brushes they make my already frizzy hair frizzier). I really love how many different types of combs this set came with they are not flimsy as ive had them for a while and none have broke."
2518,I like it..._Good tool to use on face to get rid of blackheads and the &#34;deep&#34; pimples that occur from time to time. The looped side it the one I use most when needed. Better than digging into you skin with nails trying to remove the &#34;gunk&#34;.Recommended.
6277,A great soap_A very moist and rich soap it does not leave my skin dry like some other soaps ...rich moisturizer for the skin
5040,"Essential part of my facial cleansing routine_This is a personal favorite and an essential part of my daily skin cleansing routine.Throughout highschool and parts of my early adulthood I wouldn't clean my face sufficiently, and with often wearing make up- I knew I had to stop being lazy and do something about my face.After using this product, I felt like I lifted years off my face- in fact my face didn't feel like it was my face, my face has improved so much since I first started using it... I use this once a day at night to help clean my skin from the daily impurities and my dermatologist approved it.I suffer from Rosecea and my skin is sensitive. This little one does a good job of keeping my face baby smooth without irritating it or making me red.Note: for all those people giving this a low rating just because they like their clarisonic more, PLEASE, don't do that. It's misleading for others in the sense that a good product is a good product if the value and quality are aligned. I'm sure clarisonic has it's pros but this is a GOOD and inexpensive way to get a deep facial cleansing and for most of us it gets the job done. There are always better things out there but don't rate down just because you can afford the latter."
1622,Dont waste your money._I bought this for the first time and I really thought it would last more than two weeks but it doesint so if your looking to have to redye your brows every two weeks than This is For You :).:P. chea NOT. On the upside at least this doesint cause my eye brows to fall out? like Hair dye did Dont ever EVER dye ur brows with hair dye unless u want NO brows take it from me ;-) and i mean no brows .
4625,"Working well after one week_I've only been using this a week, so I will update my review as I use this more.  In just one week, however, I have already noticed a slight increase in my lash length.For the past year, I've been taking biotin supplements as I've tried to grow my hair out, but the biotin hasn't any difference at all in my eyelashes, which have remained short. I'm hoping that Envyderm will make a difference as I use it more.My eyes are allergy-prone and sensitive, but, unlike other reviewers, this hasn't bothered me at all.  I've experienced no itching and burning after using it, even though some other similar products have irritated my eyes.The ingredients list for this seems safe, too, unlike a certain prescription product that can change the color of your eyes.To use it, you use the brush applicator to stroke it along your top and bottom lashes right before bed, just as you would apply liquid eyeliner.  It glides on smoothly and easily, and sinks right in.  I usually give myself about five minutes for it to dry before heading into bed.As mentioned above, I'll continue to update my review. For now, it seems to be working and is easy to use and apply.WEEK 2 UPDATE:  After using this for two weeks, I'm still really pleasantly surprised by how well this is working!  My lashes are really light, but they are definitely longer than they have been, and the difference is especially noticeable when I put on mascara.  The ends of my lashes also now have a nice curl to them, which they've never had before.  In the past, I've used lash lengtheners by Talika and Ardell, and, while they both worked, it took several months to see a difference. I'm surprised by how quickly this one has worked.UPDATE ON 1/8/12:  I've been using this for over two months now.  For the first six weeks, I was diligent about using it every night.  Since then, I've used it three or four nights a week.  While it did give me noticeable length in my lashes, it hasn't made my lashes anywhere near as long, lush, and full as the sample photos.  I'd say that it's comparable to the Talika serum I've used before, but it definitely works more quickly to provide growth."
1468,"Perfect!_I bought this as a gift for a friend who is interested in Irish Literature, esp. Yeats. She really was happy with it. I also love the perfume-- soft, etheral, elegant. It's good for a romantic evening, I'd say. The packaging was good and I was impressed with the short time it took to arrive at my door."
6238,great  multi use curler_my daughter had been wanting one since way b4 xmas so i finally decided to look at bught one quickly
2953,Research Thoroughly-I didn't!_Extremely disappointing.  I took a quick glance and saw lots and lots of reviews with a decent average. These are nothing special at all and trying to determine what all the small brushes are actually for is ridiculous.  The company should or could have labeled or even numbered them.  Waste of my money.
7210,"Good quality shampoo!_Cleans and lathers well. Does not dry out hair and leaves hair feeling soft. No harsh or strong chemicals. No parabens or sulfates.  Has a slight medicinal smell, but this smell does not linger after rinsing."
6200,"Excellent hair product at a reasonable cost_My stylist introduced me to this product, but it is WAY more reasonable to purchase it directly on amazon, than to buy it in the salon. It works great on color-treated and friz-prone hair."
4660,Like it_This is one of the few beauty products I like from Garnier & I really like to stress on the word 'few'.
1258,"Soothing product for dry skin_I love to be outdoors, but that can be hard on my skin.  This product really keeps my skin soft,and helps solve the problems of flaking and redness.  It only takes a little each morning or evening to make a real difference."
2796,"disappointed_I love Olay's products, but this one is a so so cleansing cloths. Be careful when you clean your eye makeup bcs they sting your eyes pretty good! I have tried using Up & Up (yes...it's Target's brand) & Ponds cleansing cloths for sensitive skin & I like them better than Olay bcs they don't burn my eyes & clean my face well. I definetly wouldn't buy Olay cleansing cloths again."
4262,Good quality n beauty_I love this silicone mat to place my iron curling on it. It's quit ok fr me but the shipping price is a little bit too high .
9605,"Not good at all; try the Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Treatment isntead_I have been using Tresemme for years now. I really love their products (and price!). I have been using theTresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Heat Activated Treatmentfor a couple of months now and I love it. I thought this conditioner would be the perfect compliment. I tried the conditioner by itself and then using it complementary to the serum treatment.Well, I was very dissapointed with the conditioner. It did not keep the frizz away at all and it did not make my hair more manageable after using the flat iron. This was just a big waste. Combining it with the serum did not result in the desired effect. I guess I will keep the serum treatment and toss this conditioner."
131,"best foundation_this is the best foundation. I use to use clinique but it during the winter when i lost my tan they did not make a shade light enough to match my skin tone. This is great, it matches my skin tone, controls my oily skin, stays on all day, and looks super natural. i'll never swtich again"
4423,"Great lip liners_Excellent lip liner all the colors are very nice you could wear  them by it self or with your favor lip stick , great product I give them a 5+"
4770,"Very Good Straightener_This is a solidly-constructed straightener with wide ceramic plates that allow for easy use. Hairspray doesn't seem to stick very well to the plates, which makes keeping the straightener clean much easier. The automatic turn-off feature is great, as is the variety of temperatures available to control the amount of straightening that is achieved. My teenage daughter says that this is great! Recommended."
5233,"Works okay_It seems to work okay. Spreads out lashes well, but doesn't make them very long. You need about 3 or 4 coats to notice a difference"
2700,"Great product!_I went to the store looking for a good moisturizer for daily body use and left with this. It's light, refreshing, and obsorbs fast. Also the smell is mild which nice especially if you want to use a body spray and don't want the smells to conflict. The big bottle is nice as well."
5543,"For Black Shatter_I purchased this item on in the middle of April. A month later, I noticed that the polish was getting very thick. I read other reviewers stating the same thing, but hey it still worked. It just made for bigger crackles on my nails. Well yesterday I opened my bottle to use it only to discover that it is now a solid black glob inside the bottle. I only used this stuff a few times, so how could it possibly become a solid block? I have never had a nail polish do this before! And OPI is held in such high regards as to quality. I am now leery about buying anymore OPI products. I have other crackle products, mostly by China Glaze, and they have never even begun to get thick. Maybe I had a bad batch."
6609,"No mess soap dispenser_This Lysol No Touch system works great. The soap bottle fits into the device without any fuss. The dispenser dispenses about a teaspoon of the soap automatically. Just place your hand or a sponge under the spout. The tangerine fragrance is fairly strong and seams to linger a bit, especially on your hands. The soap is designed for the kitchen, ie use it on dishes, sponges, counters to disinfect and clean. It is a bit strong on the skin though. The only problem I have with this system is that the bottle is not made to be refilled. Which adds to more waste when you need to replace the soap. If they made a refillable bottle with refills with less packaging, then I would have given it 5 stars."
1966,"Good for acne good for fine lines_This mask is awesome.  I have combination oily skin and I get acne break outs on my chin.  So this is how I use the mask:1. I steam my skin first, I have a Panasonic black head remover and I use that for extractions or I gently press on acne pimple to remove puss (don't torture yourself).2. I mix it in an old hair dye mixing bowl. It's a powder, is very fine and can get everywhere so be careful.  I found a scoop works best.  It does not come with one , but pouring it into the mixing bowl is messy.3. I mix equal parts with the organic apple cider vinegar.  Do little bits at a time to get the right consistency.4. Leave it on until it dries.  I found that it tightens the skin as well as helps unclog pores.  For me I noticed my fine lines diminishing after the second mask.  I also use a thicker mask and again, I felt a noticeable tingle and tightening, but not the kind of tightening you get from drug store masks, where it tightens because it's drying you out.  It feels like it's literally tightening the skin no just drying it out.Anyway, it's good stuff and I recommend for anyone."
1547,yummy!_this stuff smells so good and leaves my skin silky. huge bottle!! alot of bang for your buck here! Australian Gold rocks!!
6003,"Love! Love! love!_Wanted to purchase but read negative reviews, so I changed my mind,  then decided to purchase, so happy I did, love  love love my skin is squeaky clean,soft and smooth with one use. No complaints here!!"
4923,"Best hair oil I have tried_Ok, so I used to always use Moroccanoil and loved it.  Then my hairdresser told me to try some cheaper brands that &#34;worked the same.&#34; I have tried about 4 since I used Moroccanoil, and NONE of them came close to working like this did.  And I am dead serious.  At least for my hair, which is light blonde, very thick and coarse, this is night and day difference.  Although this is much pricier than the other brands, it is very much worth it for someone like me.  I will continue to always use this."
2461,"Effective_This exfoliator really does live up to the hype. I count on it to rid my skin of dead cells before cleaning at least 2-3 times a week. However, I have relatively hardy skin, and I disagree with the claim that it can be used daily. It is far too wasteful to use it that way. It also is possible to over exfoliate with this product, though it doesn't hurt or sting like a physical or stronger chemical exfoliator will. I noticed my skin getting a bit irritated (bumpy) and oily if I overused this (around my nose and mouth, for the most part), so I recommend using it every other day at most. It can also be a bit drying if you don't continue with the rest of your skincare routine soon after you use it.Overall: Fantastic product, but use judgement and treat it as you would any other exfoliant."
8454,"A Great Smelling Shampoo_First off, this shampoo smells great, it has shae butter and you can really smell it, but it is not an overpowering smell either.  But more importantly, it works.  After just a week my hair was noticeably softer.  The instructions are a little confusing,  it says to use bi-weekly, but that is a bit vague, does that mean twice a week or once every two weeks?  I took it to mean twice a week.  All you do it work it into your hair, leave it in for three minutes and rinse."
6342,"I LOVE this stuff!_I bought this for my aging, thinning hair which needed something to make it look alive again.  This not only smells wonderful I put it on my face when I am putting it on my hair.  Fabulous product."
9776,"Like the product.  Glad it also comes in a bar._This Irish Spring Gear Body Wash, 3 in 1, seems to be marketed toward men, but I really like Irish Spring bar soap so decided to give it a try.  The gel is thick with a faint scent of eucalyptus, but definitely was not a strong or offensive odor.  I'm very sensitive to any smell that hangs around for an extended period so I was glad this fragrance didn't become an issue.  It seemed to fade into the background after a few hours.  It never was very prominent in the first place.  Since I cannot wear most fragrances I didn't have to be concerned with competing scents.  The gel lathers up very well; I noticed there was a little more slippery feel to the shower floor than with my usual soap so you might watch for that.  It all rinsed away quite well by the end of my shower.  I did use the product on my face, just to test it out, but unfortunately it didn't keep me from having to use a moisturizing lotion later in the day for both my face and hands.  I don't plan to use it for my face again and I did not try it on my hair.If I decide to continue using this product after I've used up this 15 ounce bottle, I think I will probably switch to the Irish Spring Gear bar soap.  My husband tried the gel and, while he liked it, he did say he would prefer to have it in the bar soap.  What can I say, we are creatures of habit."
2171,"I love it!_I've read other people's reviews that they changed their formula.  Maybe I never used the &#34;original&#34; formula, but I do love everything about this bottle of lotion and I've purchased it several times over the last 3 years.  It's a great all over lotion, not greasy, doesn't promote breakouts (but I rarely use it on my face), pleasant scent.  I would totally but it again!"
359,love the scent_I love this perfume and the price was awesome...I have paid more for it in the past and since I have amazon prime it was a great deal.
3722,"Works as expected_I have used the Just for Me Hair Milk Shampoo and loved the smell.  The Shampoo has a bit of a detangler to it, but not enough moisture for my hair.  In order to keep curls from being frizzy, I need to use some product, so my hair is often dry.  Also, I have very fine hair, in spite of the curls, so my hair frizzes much easier than someone with thicker locks.  It is terrible in the summer.  Regardless, I need something with a high amount of moisturizer or my hair is just disgusting.  I probably use more conditioner than is necessary, and definitely went through this bottle before I finished the shampoo.  It works as expected.  It smells nice and doesn't tangle.  It doesn't provide the extra boost of moisturizer that I would prefer, but does help tame some of the frizz.  I suppose it is a trade off; however, I would probably stick with the shampoo and buy a different conditioner."
7017,"Really like this color_I really enjoy the color of this eyeshadow.  You can add a lot to your eyelid to make it really white, or you can just put on a very sheer layer.  Great as a primer for other eye shadows as well.  Super easy to put on and lasts awhile."
7310,"nice shampoo, updates to follow_This men's 2-in-1 dandruff shampoo and conditioner smells good, lathers well, rinses clean, and leaves hair looking good. It contains the same active ingredient as Garnier Fructis, but with some herbal additives and a different scent.So far, so good. Will update later in regard to dandruff treatment."
3848,"Very pigmented_This picture is nothing like the colour of the actual blush. When I first received it, I was very surprised to see it was a very hot pink and pigmented blush. Because I am very pale I was looking for a peachy nude blush because I already have red undertones in my skin. However if put on very lightly it is a very flattering colour which I use all the time. But beware if you are pale put it on in VERY small amounts"
9740,"Wonderful texture and smell_This product works great. It has a rich, sweet smell (but not too sweet!) and lathers up nicely. It's also very moisturizing, so it doesn't dry out your scalp. Only use a teaspoon's worth, tho, because it does lather up easily."
6479,Quick and does a good job!_These are my favorite facial wipes.  They do a great job removing all of my make-up including my eye make-up.  I've actually gotten several friends using them.  I'm too lazy to stand at the sink and wash my face so this is a good alternative.
8674,"luv this_good value and luv this product, in fact i just bought 2 more bottles.. it helps nourish and restore our hair's moisture"
4191,Runny and dries strangely_Not sure if I got the AUTHENTIC Ardell Lashtite adhesive or not....The cap and bottle looked new but it was kind of weird how there was no seal? or that plastic seal on the caps?.....Tried it a few times and I can't get the lashes to stay...maybe because I am not good at it...
3867,Smells so clean n fresh!_So much better than anything stinky you can find or they is fragrance free!  Help someone stay healthy by buying safer products
3903,"Plenty of Colors, I would like more shimmer._I just bought this because I purchased one for my cousin (the SHANY 2012 Edition All In One Harmony Makeup Kit, 25 Ounce) which I immediately fell in love with when she opened it.  I was searching on Pinterest and decided I want to learn to do the &#34;hooded&#34; look with my eye shadow.  I'm so confused because each color has about 9 different shades so I have a lot of practice.  Either way, there are plenty of colors, all came in tact without any breaking.  I do wish that there were more shimmery colors, however there are a few in this set.  I give it a 4 out of 5 because I would personally like more shimmer.  Otherwise this is a great set!"
531,"Actually works_I started getting mild acne as an adult. Most things I've tried wouldn't work or would dry out my face. I've been using this for about a month and I have nothing negative to say. It isn't sticky, doesn't have a horrible odor, goes on easy and hasn't made my skin dry. I was complemented by several people (strangers & friends) how good my skin looks. When my friend told me this yesterday I looked in the mirror and said wow my skin does look good. All I really noticed was that acne had diminished but this combo of AHA/BHA has improved my overall complexion. AWESOME!"
371,"YOU NEED THIS! TRUST ME :)_This blush is FABULOUS. I am in love with the NARS lip pencils and have been searching for a great red blush for a while. I was hesitant to try this but sooooo glad I went for it. I apply this on top of a thin layer of bronzer (although looks equally amazing with just foundation) and it looks gorgeous. I use a stippling duo fiber brush and literally just tap the brush on the palette and that's all you need! It is so pigmented I feel as if this pan will last for ages! And the color is amazing. Not to red, but a great pretty flush. Blends easily. Not too pink. JUST RIGHT. I am light to medium skin toned and it looks great. I have gotten several compliments since purchasing and now I wear this almost every day. :) THANK YOU NARS."
6664,"Great_Just what was pictured.My first time trying dotting and the tools were easy to handle,gave me great dots just where I wanted them"
3909,Easy Writer_Great Pencil! I noticed I spend so much time wasting the shave able pencils. No hassle or mess with using this eyebrow pencil.
7537,Good product_I love the 3 layers on this train case! It's perfect for organizing your favorites and making them easily accessible. Awesome product.
5144,"love it_Would highly tourecommend. This product keeps my face clear hydrated and even shrinks my pores. Definitely a must have, part of my daily routine"
9156,"Good product; applies smoothly; I use it with other products for maximum impact_I have frown and forehead lines that are more more substantial than I would like. I have been applying Beenigma twice a day for about a month. Over this time frame, I have noticed an impact on the frown lines but not such a noticeable result on the forehead lines.I began using the product in November. I first applied the product under my chin to test for an allergic reaction. I experienced about day of itching, but I did not have any redness. The immediate feeling upon the first application was a slight tingling and a tightness. The itchiness set in after a few hours. I noticed that the product had a floral scent that seemed to linger for about twenty minutes. After not noticing any significant reaction, I proceeded to use the product the next day all over my face. I did not encounter the itchiness or the tingling from the first day. The sensation of tightness did come back, but it was not uncomfortable. Throughout the weeks, subsequent applications have led to a feeling of tightness, but this sensation is often brief - maybe ten minutes.In week three, I started to use St. Ives Blemish & Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub, 6 oz in conjunction with this product and that is when I really started to begin noticing an impact on my skin. I only use the St. Ives product once a day, but once it was introduced, the frown lines began to diminish more rapidly.As noted, I have used this product for about a month. At approximately two uses per day, I have used about a third of a jar. I anticipate that this jar will take me through January. I do not use a lot of product. It spreads easily on the face and is absorbed easily as well. It does not leave an overly shiny or greasy appearance.I think the next step would be abstaining from the product for a period of time to see what impact there is. I'm curious to know: How quickly it would be before the deepness of my previous lines returns? Could the product be used once a day to maintain results? Is there a point when the product would just be a maintenance tool and no more improvement would be seen?All in all, I think that this product has had an impact on my lines. It was a great day when I woke up and truly noticed some results taking place. I want to emphasize that it was not an overnight process. I have been fairly dedicated to applying this cream, and I think it could potentially work for others.I received a jar of Beenigma to test prior to posting this review."
6069,"Great Product!_I just love the design it creates! And the color is super beautiful. I would say, picture doesn't really reflect the design that really comes out, but it's close. there are not purple tones in it. It's just dark turquoise with lighter strips, which actually opalize so beautifully!4 stars for a moody magnet: it didn't give me as good stripes on some nails as it did on others. I am not sure why, I redid those nails, and it still was not what I expected. I am going to try it again and see if it does the job and get back with the update."
4063,"Cleans and Smells Great_In addition to cleaning your hands it also leaves them soft and smooth with no residue.  I'm a big fan of method and all their products and am very happy to see that I can now get them at a discounted price in Amazon's subscribe and save store.  If you are looking for products that are good for the environment, yet really work well, I would recommend that you try any of the great products in Method's line.  I'm very happy with this purchase."
8131,"Didn't find it helpful at all..._From the description of this product, I was expecting something that worked better than the average cleansing brush on the t-zone, nose and chin areas. Unfortunately, I found this brush to be cumbersome, somewhat uncomfortable to use and inevitably ineffective. The entire brush vibrates, but the rubber bristles themselves don't move or rotate as with Oil of Olay's Cleansing Brush so I didn't find it to work well at cleansing. The awkward shape didn't work well in the places it was said to, like the corner of the nose and face. I find a cleansing pad (like a Buf-Puf) to be far easier (not to mention much cheaper) to use. The liquid cleanser didn't come with the product so I had to use another brand, but I doubt that would affect my opinion because the brush design just didn't work for me."
246,"Very easy_The easiest curler I have ever had, once got used to rod instead of clip to hold clamp I like it better I used to burn my thumb when in a hurry with small clip on clamps.  I am much safer with rod clamp.  Does a great job with big full curls"
4209,"I LOVE IT_HI.....This product a really really really wonderful ......I really loved it ....I have used and the results were very, very amazing .....I do not want to dispense with the curse .....I have won my admirationTHANKS"
8432,"Great body wash!!!!_This is an awesome body wash. I used it for the first time last night and because of the other reviews I read, pumped about 6 pumps of product onto a bath pouf.  Waay too much product, in fact this body wash DOES lather up quite a bit. I'm thinking those that posted this doesn't lather might have hard water and didnt realize that should have been factored in. Anyway this stuff is amazing and paired with the designer skin Angel lotion I feel like I didn't wash off most of my tan today. It smells amazing too! Will definitely buy again!"
967,"Beware if you have sparse eyebrows_I have very light blonde eyebrows (like you really can't see them) and blonde hair.  I have been using eyebrow pencil since middle school because of this.  I found this and read all the good reviews on the eyebrow color (just the tint).  Evidently it's an &#34;add on&#34; and I couldn't order just the tint, which is nicely priced.  I tried adding another item to my cart and it still wouldn't let me order the tint.  (Confused).  I didn't want to spend a bunch of money getting more stuff so I could order it, and so I found this (Tint & Shape).  Thankfully, I was finally able to order with this one.I got the light brown color.  I had read rave reviews about how wonderful this stuff is for blonde eyebrows and how it makes sparse eyebrows look fuller.  I will be honest when I say that I did not even know my eyebrows were so sparse until I used this.  The process is super easy which is nice.  It should only take a few minutes to do.  Sadly, I messed with it for about half an hour before I realized this stuff would not work for me.  It eventually darkened the hair I have, but it just emphasizes that I have sad, sparse eyebrows.This was really disappointing because I thought FINALLY I could have natural-ish eyebrows (and I could have bangs in my hair without rubbing off eyebrow pencil all day).  Nope. Sad. Disappointment.I do not recommend this if you have sparse eyebrows."
8434,Keration is the go to for my hair_I will be using Keratin products from this point on...my kinky curl hair feels good smells good too :D! nice
8857,"The new Deva Clips are great, but the products cause frizz on me_I've been using Deva products since I discovered the Curly Girl method of no silicones or sulfates about two years ago.  I actually really like the smell of the products and they leave my hair really soft.  That being said, I've come to find that the glycerin in them creates frizz on my fine, 2C waves.This starter pack, though, is a great way to try out the products and see if you like them.It also comes with the new Deva Clips, which I love!  They're about twice the size of the regular clips, and give me great lift at the roots of my hair, where I tend to fall flat.  If you go to the Deva website, you can also find some picture tutorials of how to use them.Deva makes some really nice products, and they helped me embrace my waves!"
5306,"Another Aveeno Winner_My wife and I both have fairly thick hair.  This shampoo does a great job of leaving it feeling clean and soft.  The fragrance is subtle and natural, not an overwhelming chemical perfume.  I can't say much of anything about the color-preservative claim.  I haven't noticed any difference in my blond hair or my wife's chocolate-brown hair.  The shampoo leaves it soft and shiny, and my wife doesn't get 'fly away' hairs with this product.  In that respect, it's similar to other Aveeno shampoo products we've used, all of which have been pleasant alternatives to the industrial strength stuff."
5664,Use these all the time!_You can use these for anything. I use these for nail designs and they really come in handy. Some of the tips werent secured in place so i super glued them so they wouldnt come out.
2296,"Best ridge filler, EVER!!!_I read a lot of reviews about this baby and I must say.....OMG!!! this is by far the best ridge filler for my nails.I am very busy with house cleaning and gardening not to mentioned my dogs playing so that pretty much wears my manicure to nothing and the nail polish does not last me long...maybe 3 days if I'm lucky.After ready the reviews, I decided to try this OPI Ridge Filler and.......holy macaroni!!! I had my nails done 2 weeks and even though the nail polish is just NOW coming out....the new grow of my nail has the nail polish intact, I can even feel the filler glued to my nail, it's amazing, it's like having acrylic without the inconvinience of the price and pain of the machine that grimes into your nails.Time for another manicure that will last 2 weeks :-)"
3753,"Good alternative_I wasn't sure if I was going to start rollersetting regularly, so instead of buying a 200$ bonnet dryer large enough to fit my rollers, I purchased this.  The heating can be inconsistent if you don't use the 'High' setting, and it's super hot on high and hot.. so I'm not sure, but my hair looks great and healthy so I can't complain.Takes a LONG time to dry, but I expected that with mid back natural 3c. :("
309,MY FAVORITE CLEANSING  GEL_I love Avalon organics product line!!! This if my favorite cleansing gel for the shower. I bought it originally for my face but it was to harsh for my face so now I use it for my entire body and it leave my skin squeaky clean without overdrying. Thank you Avalon organics for your Vegan & organic product line!!!
2236,"Excellent for what it is...a hairdresser's view..._I have been a hairdresser for 27 years and I'm starting to have rotator cuff problems. I needed something lighter than what I was using. Seriously, I could juggle these, if I had to, it's THAT light.Granted it doesn't quite have the power of the dryers I've used over the years, but honestly, it's not bad. I still get my clients out the door on time. It has definitely given my shoulder a break, big time. You won't find a professional dryer lighter than this (to my knowledge). Happy with my purchase and would buy it again."
744,"My favorite face product_I use this as a face moisturizer and it's the best! The oil doesn't clog just leaves your skin super soft by the aloe Vera and vitamin e, and the tea tree REALLY wipes out my acne. It's so gentle so zero irritation. Plus, a little goes a long way! The bottle lasts me around 7-9 months or so, I highly recommend! ( this is what got my face clear from what my used to be bad acne! )"
5036,"A NEW FACE_I am so inpressed with this facial cleanser. I just put my cleanings cream on with a little water & run this little cleanserand I am here to tell you my face feels so refreshed and looks amasing.If you have a lot of money, you will have more in your purse if you purchase this cleaner to buy other things.I buy most everything here at Amazon, however I bought this at Walmart (and it cost more) than on this Amazon Site.Enjoy, I am sure you will."
1585,best buffer_this is the best buffer I have...I use it all the time....and they last for a very very long time
5944,"Love Love LOVE this._I used to go get facials all the time once I hit 30, but soon realized they were WAY too expensive. This product is absolutely perfect for the budget conscience people who still want to keep their skin looking fantastic. I hit the big 40 this year and my skin was showing signs of it. Heck even after the first use of this thing people said my skin was glowing. (Nice to hear once in a while) I look forward to seeing what results come from long term use of this baby! But I will say my skin is so soft and am very happy with it thus far!"
6171,sleep easy._I use pillow curlers because they are soft and I don't like to lose any sleep so these are great. I use Pillow curls for braid outs along with mixed chick or cashmere curls product when my hair is wet and I braid it and put the pillow curlers at the end to keep them in place then I put a satin sleeping cap on and go to sleep. Wake up take them out and my curls are tight and beautiful. You can also wash then if they become dirty. I  soak them in a mild detergent and let them air dry.
5332,Smells divine_I was looking for a roller perfume that didn't cost an arm and a leg and was small enough to fit into my bag so I can refresh my scent throughout the day and came across this product.  It smells very musky and calming which I like and makes me feel fresher.
1615,"good , fast_i got the product on time , and the product is good , i like clinique dramatically different moisturizing lotion very much , i order 8boxes  this time , if can give me a good price i will order more.. thanks."
5988,Wow!!!!!!_Words cannot express how amazing this Volume dryer is. The volume dryer straightens my hair a whole lot better than these salons near my house that charge $50 $60. Well worth the money!!!!!!!
1196,"Clean, pure, and simple_Just stepped out of the shower after using this soap for the first time.  I was impressed by how well it lathered - you get lots of suds really quickly, and don't need to use tons of the product.  I love baking soda because it has so many uses, so I was curious to try this soap.  Upon taking it out of the package, I smelled it and was pleased to find that I could detect the light, clean scent of baking soda - but not in an overpowering way.  It has no unnecessary dyes or additives, isn't tested on animals, and is suitable for sensitive skin.  Right now, my skin feels clean and smells good, in a plain way (which is a refreshing change - I often use scented soaps, but it's nice to try something different).I would say this is an excellent option for people who are allergic to most products, don't like the artificial smells of most soaps, or just want something that incorporates baking soda.  If you're picky about smells, this soap won't disappoint. Also worth noting, coconut oil is listed as one of the ingredients.  If you suffer from dry skin, be it chronically or due to the winter cold, coconut oil is a natural, healthful, and highly effective product.  Having it in the soap will keep skin soft and smooth.And never fear, you will NOT smell like a &#34;grandpa&#34; after using it!  Just good and clean."
9092,"I've gotten bigger wigs on Amazon, this is not it._VERY platinum blonde. VERY stiff. Looks very wig-y... The bangs are down to my chin. I was very disappointed when I opened the package."
207,"My Go To Serum_Sensitive Skin? Check.  Irritated by Perfumes and Scents? Check.  No bad reactions to this product:? CHECK!  I love Olay and their fragrance free products.  This one keeps wrinkles in check, keeps my skin looking young and doesn't irritate.  I will continue to purchase again and again."
1883,"I like Dermalogica products_I like Dermalogica products. I use this face wash when my skin gets congested, been using this particular product for years and still happy with the results."
6215,"Mediocre product with a horrible dispenser_As a 37-year-old woman with very fair skin, I take my skin-care regime and the products I use very seriously. Even with a great deal of care, there comes a time when we all start to notice 'experience lines' and look for the products that can help us minimize the impact on our look.  Unfortunately, I am going to have to keep looking.The product barely made an impact on the fine lines on my face.  I followed the application procedures and applied it under one eye, hoping to be able to judge the comparison. Even after waiting for a bit, I saw no real difference.  What I did see was so slight that I wondered if it was down to wishful thinking.  The next day when I tried this same application on the other eye, I called my husband in to see if he could pick the eye that had been treated.  Sadly, he could not.  I tried it for several days with the hopes that perhaps there would be some sort of cumulative effect, but there was not.  It did seem to make the skin feel a bit more soft, so at least there was that.Even if the product had worked, the dispenser was horrible.  It reminded me of the cheap perfume samples they hand out sometimes at the mall.  The pump barely moves at all and when it does, you either get nothing, or a double-dose.  Considering the price of this little bottle, you would think they could put more effort into the dispenser.I cannot recommend this product as much better results can be had with a simple moisturizer applied twice daily."
8711,Glitter Polish that works! (NOT for heavy work)_I actually like this polish a lot! It does have a rough finish to it (why its called Sands). It seems as if the glossy polish just evaporates to leave the color and sparkles. You are not supposed to put a top layer on so we'll see how well it lasts. I am rough with my hands so we'll see what happens.*UPDATE*So not even three days later and it has already started to chip. I guess I shouldn't be surprised but I am disapointed. Was hoping it would actually stay longer. Oh well. Time for a re-do.All in all-if you work with your hands a lot expect this to chip fairly soon.
1821,My Signature Color_This is my signature color that they don't sell at the Bare Essentials store anymore.  I came online to find it and ended up buying 7 of them!  I wear this all the time and it never dries out my lips the way that other lip glosses do.  A must buy if you can't find the right color at the store.
7511,"Nail Art 3d 80 Pieces Mix Kitty Head & Bow Tie /Rhinestone for Nails,..._absolutely the most adorable 3-d nail art peices ever!!  love these...the variety of colors are perfect...great for grab bags with friends..they don't bleed when you put nail polish top coat on them.  when you place them in the acrylic for acrylic nails they don't bleed.  great price and the shipping was suprisingly fast...will definitely be buying more."
3707,"Good Product_Purchased for my son, who does not like bar soap.  Good price, good product.I would buy again at the right price."
2,"Love the smell of this!_I haven't been a big fan of Prada's fragrances over the years but absolutely fell in love with the sweetness and candy-like scent of this perfume! This smells like a sweet, decadent caramel with tones of vanilla and I'm not sure what else, but it smells great! Although, I must say that this seller is asking for WAY too high a price for this bottle! You could get the 2.7 oz bottle for around the same price at Neiman Marcus (the 1.7 oz for around $80 if you prefer a smaller bottle)!"
8754,"The best new lip color_I love that this has a stain, and a very smooth application; it makes it longer lasting and the color I chose is perfect! (petal rebel)"
8972,"Excellent_We live in Florida and though we are very careful we still do get burned at times, epseicially in spring. This really soothed our burns from mid-april without stinging, staining or greasy ick. Very highly recommended."
7700,"Great Plates_These plates are very nice.  I have the other sets and I like this one better because the images are larger.  This is good for me since I have wide nails.  There are so many cute and pretty designs, cant wait to try them.  I received them in 5 days of ordering.  This price is great compared to Konad.  You can't go wrong ordering these."
9149,Great Manual Face Brush!_I adore this brush! It's great for my sensitive skin!
1659,"I never tried it because one word ORGANIX is something to think...READ!!!!! NATURAL HAIR CARE_I never had bought or tried it, but I knew from reading ingredients that it has cones (silicones) it is easy to find out if you goggle asking does the certain mane of it has cones and then you will know wheter cones end with cone, -conol, or -xanethe most known cone is dimethicone."
9781,Okay_This one was only &#34;meh&#34; for me.I think in trying to be both exfoliating and hydrating it really doesn't do either terribly well. But the deal breaker is the smell- so artificially &#34;springlike&#34; and it lingers on the skin after your shower. If you like the smell of Irish Spring it won't bother you. I don't so it does.
3046,"A Worthwhile Purchase._This is a great flat/curling iron. I wanted to do a solid review so I flat ironed half my head using the Remington and the other with the Chi flat iron I always use and I have to say that the Remington did a great job - not as excellent as the Chi, but solid.What makes the Remington a good value, besides coming close to offering the straightness and luster that almost works as well as a Chi, is that it has a temp. control that is easy to manage ... love that.A tip to flat ironing is to use a nice heat resistant product as to not kill your strands, Tressame, Aussie and Isoplus make some great ones. My hair type is 3A, Curly, but with the humdity it can be a thick ball of yarn and Remington came just short of using my usual iron.If you have the cash, buy the Chi. If you don't the Remington is a worthwhile purchase."
8628,"Fails to deliver on hype-over priced for what it does do_Nexus says it's weightless moisturizer shampoo will 'Keep(s) hair feeling fresh, revived and voluminous without added weight.' And does it? Uh no, at least not in my case.Shampoos can vary and so long as it scrubs up and such it is doing its job but that having been said you can get one for a lot less than the $9+ price tag this carries to do the same work. After using it a few times my hair was not particularly 'voluminous,' in fact it seemed limper and flatter than normal and the shampoo itself was the only thing I'd changed from my usual routine.Add to that my wife said that my hair had a scent of cedar after using this. Luckily she likes cedar but I don't think you want a shampoo to `surprise' you by added its own scent to whatever you are planning, without letting you know it is doing it.So over all, it did lather up and it did clean my hair but it added its own perfume to the proceedings and it certainly seemed to fail at its promise to add volume and revivification to my hair. Add to that the higher price tag compared to other shampoos that will perform at this level for less and I have to say give this a pass."
5904,"expectations met_I would give it five stars but I didnt fully enjoy the plastic black packaging but that is my only complaint.  this product was 100% authentic, affordable and effective.  I whipped it with a hand mixer and made a vitamin e whip to seal and moisturize my ends with and its done a fantastic job so far. this whip has my hair looking healthy, strong and moisturized. lovely :)"
1460,"Fun and fruity_This is a flirty perfume with citrus top notes and musky vanilla undertones. It's very different from the perfumes I usually wear in that it is fruity and has a very youthful, fun fragrance, but I like it...and of course the packaging is to die for! However, for some reason, a one ounce bottle costs almost $80 in department stores, but it looks like you can buy it a lot cheaper on Amazon, which is what I suggest doing."
6870,Worth having_Great brushes. I love how affordable they are and quality is solid I even use a few of them as clean up brushes for around my cuticles. I have two sets of these.
5362,Works great_Used this as soon as. I got it and it does a great job cleaning out my brushes.  Seems pretty mild but does the trick.
3891,Awesome_I love this hair dryer.  no sitting half a day waiting for my hair to dry up in curlers. This dries my hair in 20 or so minutes and my hair is super thick and course.
3242,"My favorite so far_This gel defines and holds my coils all day. It makes my hair look shiny and neat. I don't like that it leaves my hair slightly stiff and a little dry if I dont use my leave in conditioner and olive oil before I put it in but overall its a winner and a good value. I like it better thane shine curl activator gel whiuch leaves my hair less defined and slightly damp and sticky feeling. My ideal product would define my coils and stretch them some and leave my hair shiny soft and mosturized without being sticky, stiff or damp to the touch, plus a reasonable price and maybe able to stretch my style 2-3 days. With most products including this one I wash them out daily or everyother day.  This one flakes on day 2.  My hair is type 4a fine, cottony, coily, strands with 75% shinkage."
2247,"WORTHY OF SIX STARS - I'M CONFIDENT YOU'LL LOVE IT TOO!_The noticable and dramatic effects of this product offers are astounding.  I'm on my third bottle of it after having tried a number of other products by well known, very high end makers - which did not satisfy me.  It's easy and simple to use, it contains ingredients in nice proportions, results can be felt almost immediately, and it's priced affordably (for me).  The results I reap from using it regularly meet my high expectations and exceed results from competitors.  Smooth, velvet-like skin, that's even & brightened in tone and clarity is difficult to achieve without using this product.  It has never clogged pores or caused any other sensitivity issue (to which I'm prone) and it has almost no aroma (good ro bad).  I love, will continue to buy it & highly recommend it!"
5269,"Gentle scent and soft skin_The product description that caught my eye was &#34;Instant foaming technology saves time, money and water, Moisturizing formula won't dry out hands Naturally safe and non-toxic&#34;In my experience this soap has a very gentle feel on hands, good for kids and adults, the fragrance is very soft and doesn't linger.  Just gives a soft clean feel to hands.  The pump is filled with liquid that instantly foams on your skin.  Each pump seems to last quite a while... longer than it looked like it would.  Good for frequent hand washing and/or sensitive skin."
5420,god lotion_This lotion has a bad smell but gives you a great dark color.Fast service.I will order more at this price
5895,"Worst Ever_I bought this after reading all the reviews and seeing how wonderful it was. I had high hopes and bought it at my local store. It is NOT worth it. At least not if you have thin lashes that are typically straight. I knew wet formulas could be bad for my lashes, BUT I have used others with a decent result so I gave this a shot. This made my lashes look like one giant lash, and like I painted IT ON WITH A PAINT BRUSH.Maybe I don't know how to use the wand or just got a bad tube. But just be careful buying it, it's very very wet. Thin lashes take caution."
6881,"The wait is worth it!_I spent what seemed forever for these to be delivered, but when they came, what a bargain!  So many styles, shapes and versions of brushes and at a terrific price. The wait was worth it; now I'm having fun doing my own nail art and save time and money doing them myself. Thank you for this great set of nail art brushes!"
1065,"john frieda shine shock_this stuff is great, however I think it might be discontinued.  Quite alot of John Frieda gets discontinued, then we have to find something like it.  I happened to find it online and stocked up but it will be gone someday, too bad"
2000,"Removes make up so easily_Makes my face feel so soft after taking make up off. I wear colorstay makeup and these makeup removing wipes work fantastic, they leave my skin feeling clean and soft, they even remove the mascara! These truly are great makeup removing wipes!"
1044,"Great Product, Needs Better Packaging_I love this stuff. I use it for EVERYTHING--to soothe my skin, to smooth my hair, to moisturize my skin. It's perfect. It's never sticky, is orderless--other than a slight fresh aloe smell. The pump really makes it easy to use. My only gripe is that I have a lot of product left at the bottom of my bottle, but the straw straw doesn't reach, so I have to constantly upturn the bottle, or dig and scrape the bottom to get the last of my gel out of the bottle."
1405,"great daily lotion - will continue to buy_Aveeno is another great product that I use often and have had very few bad experiences with.  This daily lotion is seriously awesome - goes on light and smooth, doesn't feel oily, and lasts all day.  It doesn't have a scent."
8259,"Dove Face Lotion_I'm so glad I had the opportunity to try this product!  I love the light scent and the light feeling of this on my face.  I use it every morning after my shower.  Just a very small amount does the trick.  I've actually found that if my hands are just slightly moist, I can use about a pea-size drop of lotion and smooth it over my entire face.  This stuff is almost a necessity for me in the winter months because my face will get extremely dry.Some face lotions I've used in the past felt heavy or oily and I didn't like using them because I would actually get blackheads, especially near my eyes for some reason.  So, I was a little apprehensive in trying this lotion.  But I'm sure glad I did.  The price isn't bad eith (around seven bucks)."
2213,***** Dry's Fast *****_I use this product all the time dries quickly and makes a glossy finish. Highly recommend for your final step of polished nails......
472,Pore Vacuum_This is fantastic. I love it. It works great. You must take your time and do it correctly but it works really good. I live out in the country and we get pretty dirty out here and this is a great way to get those pores cleaned out. Your skin feels great afterword and you can see the difference it makes.
7301,"Makes hair fall out_After extended use, this product made my hair start falling out. Every time I took a bath there was a huge pile of hair in the drain. Every time I brushed it my hair started coming out.  I stopped using the product immediately and the problem stopped."
4860,nice dark purple-ish black_I love this color. No curing issues even with the dark color. I love to apply water field over it to give it a bigger sparkle!
4288,"Great for natural hair_This is one of my staple products. The Shea Moisture line has been hit and miss for me, but this is a hit. In the summertime I wear my hair in an afro or twists, so I need something to keep my kinks soft and moisturized. This was worth every penny. Even if I forgot to wrap up my hair at night and woke up with the Kid&Play, with this product I was able to coax my hair into a more attractive style with no tangling or breakage."
2121,"Wow!_Forget the clumsiness of a brush and hair dryer to do the trick, this is two in one and it's really great! It has a cool shot, different brush attachments, etc. No complaints!"
5825,"Self Gift_one of the best Soaps I enjoyed using and will tell all my friends its a must try ,when looking to feel your best."
8823,"Good but could be more sturdy_I bought this sponge because I have combination skin, and needed something that would exfoliate any dry skin without drying it out too much. I use this sponge and alternate between cream cleansers (Olay Total Effects 7 Revitalising Foaming Cleanser and Neutrogena Deep Clean Cream Cleanser) and it leaves me with super soft skin.The major complaint I have about this sponge is that it began falling apart after about 2 weeks of using it. I leave this sponge hanging in my shower, and it began to disintegrate at the spot that it would lay up against the shower wall (I assume because of too much moisture accumulation). I let it air dry and am especially careful to not let it touch anything while doing so, and that seems to have helped the problem, but still frustrating that I'm left with a hole/indent on one side of this sponge.Overall, I recommend giving the Konjac sponge a try if you are looking for an exfoliating clean for combination skin, but be wary of the shelf life and don't be surprised if it doesn't stay looking brand new for long."
2637,the only EMU oil I will order_this is the best EMU oil for the price and value. i use it for joint pain all over my body after an epson salt bath. it is wonderful!
8394,"Very satisfied_I rated this 4 stars. I like all the different colors it came with because you have so many to choose from. They are random but you get a wide verity with a few repeats. The nice thing is, is the colors I didn't like I use to peel off the nail and make a line, and the colors I like I can leave on the nail as a stripe. It is kind of hard working with the tape because it is so thin and small and to find the end of the tape is almost impossible so I recommend sticking a little piece of paper to the end so you don't lose the end of the tape. When leaving the tape on the nail it doesn't last as long, the edges will start to peel up, so I think it's better just using it to make a line and peeling it up. Over all I am very happy with this purchase, a lot for a little and worth it."
7408,Good Product_I love the colors. The pigments are vibrant and very soft to the skin and they go on very smooth. I get a lot of product on my brushes so i don't have to use a lot. I own a few palettes by sleek and I have not been disappointed yet. Good products for a MUA who is looking for a palettes instead of individual pots.
338,Homemade replenishing mist._For those of you that use Wen you will find this rose water as a good alternative when your favorite replenishing mist is sold out. Mix a few of your favorite essential oils and your hair will smell lovely.
643,Good seller.  Bad product.  My nails have never split like this before._Good seller.  When the brush broke off in the bottle on first use they replaced it as soon as I emailed them a pic.  That said: wish I'd asked for a refund.  Since I started using this stuff my (normally fine) nails have begun to split and crack.  I thought is was because of the winter but then the weather changed and I realized it wasn't the cold at all.  This base coat is just terrible for my nails.  I'm throwing it out.
8092,"Effective sunscreen. No complaints._Happy to see that oxybenzone isn't in the ingredient list. The scent is strong, but pleasant, but might not be for everyone. It goes on almost effortlessly and absorbs quickly. My son-in-law tested it out on a day when he was out in the sun all day and it was perfectly effective in protecting him from getting a sunburn."
3723,"Silky Smooth_My sister is mixed and due to that reason she has a hard time finding a conditioner that will leave her hair soft but not leave it looking greasy. After trying the Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner, 13.5-Ounce Bottle I am convinced we have found something that will work great for her! I would suggest this product to others looking for great results."
926,"100% Tea Tree Oil_NOW Foods Tea Tree Oil is a good price. Tea tree oil offers many health benefits. It tastes kind of gross, yet it works to keep healthy gums, skin issues, etc. Also included in Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, which will save you even more. A great natural oil."
9515,Nice smell!_I have had some great Suave products and some not so good this one is more towards the good level. First off with all Shampoos/Conditioners I check to see if I like the smell and this one was a winner there. After my shower it gave my hair strength and bounce so I could style it the way that I lke it.Would try!
2050,"I like it!_I bought this at Sephora and for the most part, it does a great job at highlighting under the eyes. It feels really light and it actually covers my dark circles, which is awesome! I would of given it 5 stars, but it really didn't give much of a lift effect, it just made under my eyes look better (I'm 18), but it still does an amazing job."
2591,Good Product_I think this product works you just have to be patient. If it does work it works slower than a turtle crawls.
383,Bare Minerals Eye Shadow - 0.57 grams (Voodoo)_This color eyeshadow looks great when it is applied wet. Nice color and I like the fact that there are no irritants like talc.
3826,"Im IN LOVE!_I love how I can play with all the shades plus I am always a different hue every other week due to the Texas sun. This allows me to change concealers without purchases many other expensive brands. One Big Plus is that Contouring is Amazing this Product. LOVE! Do not think twice about getting it like I did, just purchase it."
4828,"Love this color!_This color is beautiful, it looks like a sparkley ruby slipper.  Gorgeous!  After paying $30 a pop to have some one else apply the gel polish too thin and not cure it long enough, I thought I would try it myself.  I have already saved money!"
2914,Cool_Just what I was looking for and then some. This should last me awhile. I've searched all over for this pencil. Which drugstores actually carry them for the same price if not more and they are your average size. This was quite the bargain for sure.
6146,"HG concealer!_I have very fair skin and suffer from hyper-pigmentation. A few weeks ago, I had one of the worst break outs in years which left me with lots of marks to cover. I have had issues with marks for eight years now, so I've tried many concealers. Most recently, dermablend, erase paste, and boing both by benefit. None of those concealers worked as well as this does. If you can find it in a Walmart near you, I suggest you do that because I got mine there for $6. The teeniest amount covers me entire face perfectly (which layers of foundation were never able to do.) I mean, smaller than a fourth of a pea size. A super tiny amount. It's great and stays on all day. Definitely recommend!"
6727,"I Like RoC Products_It is always hard to know if your moisturizers are doing all that can be done to fulfill the stated claims of every brand. The RoC Multi Correxion Stress Repair Eye Cream, 0.5 Ounce leaves the skin around my eyes feeling soft and more elastic. Anyway, I have decided to work with this brand to see if I can at least maintain my skin's relatively good genetics. So far I am satisfied."
8715,Beautiful_Love it ... love the color and the texture! amazing i will be ordering more ..opi is a great brand
3778,"Water thin_I tried this product because I wanted something that was not pricy. It is a waste of money. Its water thin, sits in your pores leaving them light green. I have redness in the T-zone area and it does nothing. I do not recommend this product at all.  I will be returning it."
7166,fimo nail art_love them.  Thanks.  I already used them and they look good!  I like the choices available to me in one little reel
5194,"nice_I got a variety set for my brushes, and they fit properly on all my straight-angle brushes. It does slow down the process of drying, but you're not suppose to dry your brushes with this on them anyway. I feel in need of this since I travel a lot, and the brush guard helps to protect my brushes. Although personally I think it's just a net and shouldn't cost this much, it's still a very handy and useful tool."
1307,Happy. Affordable and do the job!_I think it's a great yet affordable product.I was leaning towards smashbox primer but really didn't appreciated the price.This primer is feel similar.I been wearing it underneath my makeup foundation and compering it to another brands - this one didn't cause me to brake out.
968,Great iron_This size works well for my shorter hair. It heats up quickly has auto shut off and holds hair well. Good curl and is a good weight and quality. Can't go wrong wi th Conair.
5009,"Another great one_Paul Mitchell line of hair and skin care products having always been pleasing to the wallet and to the scalp, hair and skin! They all do what they state they will do and with a special pleasing smell. Love Paul Mitchell products!"
3995,Don't work_I bought these thinking they would help put on my make up easier. I was wrong. They are small and it absorbs too much make up.
9587,Smells wonderful and makes my hair soft_This conditioner comes in an 8 ounce bottle. It&#8217;s a white and sweet smelling conditioner that smells great and makes my hair very soft. I think it works as well as any conditioner that I have ever used but I guess I was expecting more. I am not sure what a conditioning mask is but I expected it to do a little more than a good conditioner. I am not complaining because I really like Tresemme products in general but this bottle is small at 8 ounces and I would rather have one of the large 25 ounce bottles of Tresemme conditioner for the same price.
8976,Love it!!!!_I really like the container that allows you to pump out a little at a time. It doesn't leave my nails bone dry and flacking like the OPI nail polish remover does... I really like it...
2015,Great for Young Girl_My daughter is wearing make-up for the first time and this has been great for her.  I would recommend this product.
1565,"excellent pressed powder_this is a very natural pressed powder, this is the second time I buy it and will keep on purchasing it, have tried many but this is I find to do the job great."
3172,"Volume_I love mascara, and this one is good.  Not my favorite, but it does add volume without clumps and it's doesn't smear by the end of the day."
3135,"Good stuff at a great price_I have fine, thin, damaged hair that I color, and the color always fades fast. So I was looking for a sulfate free shampoo, but they were all much too expensive. This product is very reasonably priced, and while it's not a miracle worker, it's made my color last longer, gets my hair very clean without making it frizz, and doesn't make it oily looking, either- so many color care shampoos have conditioner in them that weighs it down and this doesn't have that! I haven't been having to use conditioner after shampooing with this product, even on the ends. And a really nice bonus is that it only takes a tiny amount of product to lather up and clean my hair."
4780,"The Best of Non-Salon Power Dryers_I have gone through too many hair dryers.  The accompanying instructions for this dryer are excellent. In addition to the usual safety instructions, Remington outlines how to use it, hair care tips and cleaning and maintenance in very clear English.  Drying my curly hair was easier than I thought, it did seem that I could have straighter, smoother results than with most dryers that promise that sleek look.  The dry time was much faster with the important control airflow concentrator.I didn't drop the hair dryer when I tried to change speed or heat settings - don't laugh, I've smashed many objects by dropping dryers!  It did get a bit heavy for me, but I am accustomed to a heavy dryer.  I am really not sure that the 'salon collection' is a purely honest model name.  Salon dryers withstand often 7-8 hours a days of constant use.  After buying  three rather inexpensive flat (straightening) irons, I finally bought a a genuine expensive salon iron; it's now eight years old and always works.  I like this Remington, but I'm not sure it will last eight years."
8028,"Love It!_I just finished a bottle of this product, and it works great. I ha e naturally curly hair that I wet-set for manageability. This product  leave my hair so soft, and it smells great- like baby powder. This will be a staple from now on."
3956,Dove_The almond cream dove has a great scent. It smells similar to the shea butter scent. I like it and will order again.
3481,"Love it, with reservations_This is a terrific quick way to do your eyebrows. I bought it in ash, which turned out to be darker than I'd expected, more of a light brown than dark blond. That said, you have the choice to use more or less of it. Using more gives a darker result. The thing I love about this product is that I can dispense with pencil or powder and just quickly swipe this wand over my brows, concentrating on the sparse sections, and I'm done. I can't give a report on the white end of the tube, which supposedly promotes hair growth. I'll try it, but it sounds a bit snake-oily to me."
4418,"Big no_unfortunately, these pencils are not good as it should be and even if you hate them up to take the liquid from them, it did not work for me at all."
8221,"Best to When in a Rush!_I like to keep this moisturizer with me mostly the whole day because it's perfect when I am in a rush to go to work and don't have time to rub in a heavy or creamy moisturizer. I keep it in my makeup bag most of the time, but when I am home I keep it by my bed side so when I get out of the shower I have easy access to hydrated skin. I love this scent most solely because it contains cocoa butter and that's usually what I use on it's own at night time when I really have the time to rub in my moisturizer to my skin. All I do is spray this onto my skin wait about 30 seconds for it to settle, rub and go...it's that simple! You have to be very careful not to spray too much at one given time in any particular area because it can get greasy so it's best to spray it at a good distance and only once to that area. (DISCLOSURE : I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and  I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.)"
4219,"If I could, I'd give is 6 Stars!!! This stuff is da bomb for refreshing curls_Okay, that holler you heard? Yeah, that's me in Miami howling at how fabulous this stuff is to refresh second and third day curls to give them renewed moisture and clumpage and defrizz. Oh, my gosh. How good is this stuff?Crazy good.It's got a creamy consistency, smells like a melange of mango and coconut--so delectable--and it has various uses. The original use was as a curl styler on wet hair. I have not used it like this--yet--though other gals on my curly hair forum have raved about it as a lightweight curl styling creme for summer that doesn't weigh down hair and adds great moisture.I've used it as a curl refresher on second and third day hair. If you have curly hair, you know that it looks great day one, and by day two, the curls are starting to either droop or dry out or frizzing up or unclumping. Something is happening. Well, this remoisturizes, helps defrizz, and encourages curl to spring up again and even, on me anyway, reclump. It's DA BOMB!!!!In combination with the exquisite miracle called Curl Junkie CURLS IN A BOTTLE (a curl definer, shine-inducer, frizz-diminisher par excellence for dry and frizz-prone curly hair) is a killer styling duo. I'm telling you. If you have curly hair and want a quality, botanicals-filled product that smells nummy and makes your hair happy---try this. TRY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!I do recommend you google up the Curl Junkie site and Naturally Curly and do searches on youtube, cause lots of us curlies are raving about this stuff.NOTE: I did try using it on wet hair rather than my usual use of it dry, and it was not so great. First day hair was floofy-droopy. However, it somehow morphed better day by day, and I got to third day hair that looked way better than first WEIRD. The order is generally the other way (great first hair curls, worse day by day). However, the curls were revived by adding CCCC Lite to DRY hair each day, so, this confirms this product works supergreat on dry hair. On me, not on wet hair. (And while some ladies love it on wet, I've heard from two who have the same issue as me using it on wet--floof and droop. YMMV)UPDATE, July 2010: Okay, I've discovered that this is GREAT as a curl enhancer on wet hair when used in combination with Curls in a Bottle (by Curl Junkie) as a serum on top of it. Really nice voluminous, springy curls--frothy, airy when diffused--that withstood Miami summer humidity heat quite well. So glad I didn't give up on using it on WET hair."
4811,"My opinion about Paris Hilton Teese_Since leaving the market this fragrance, I wanted to prove that I have purchased other of this famous model, and I do not really regret, is a lovely scent and I arrived in the promised time, I always buy my perfumes amazon and so far I feel satisfied with the service received."
7719,Yaaaay! Now it comes with SPF_This is the one of the few BB Cream I tried that didn't cause acne.  I tried the Korean brand Missha which was pretty good but much harder to find and more expensive.  This is affordable and goes on well.
3836,"Great product at a good price_I was about to purchase a brow powder kit that cost about four times as much as this one, but then at the last minute thought, eh what the heck, for the price I might as well give it a try. So glad I did, because it works great! I use a small angled brush and I brush a little wax on, then powder and apply to my eyebrow. Gives a great fill and stays on well. Impressed with the product for the price! I should note that the brushes included are absolute crap. I didn't expect much of anything from them though, so I wasn't disappointed."
1484,"Very pigmented and bronzy_I liked this blush, but it is more like a bronzer/blush. It was a little too dark for me in the winter. I may try it again in the summer when I am tan. It is highly pigmented and was just too much for me in this time of the year."
6219,"Color as Pictured, Truly Matte, Lasts Long_The color is as pictured. I like the matte look of the lipstick and the fact that it lasted for a couple of hours before it needed to be reapplied. But the lipstick wasn't very moist. I ordered another color of this lipstick and it was much moister."
540,"Got a reaction to this, and tangled  hair._This cleaned my scalp well but made my hand itch really bad during the shower. I took the shampoo and used it in another shower stall, got the same reaction on my hand. And, only with this shampoo, nothing else. Even though this shampoo cleans my scalp well, it is a bit drying and tangled my hair. Plus, the smell is really strong, lingers on me for days end, and I am not fond of the smell. I used to hear that this is a good product, but it went downhill once they changed the formula. I wonder if I would've had better luck with the old formula."
5104,Most get!_Easy to use nail color come out easy and fast soak sweet to use  as well i feel great to have order this to.
2356,Not bad for the money..._Great product! I would recommend this to anyone who like the wave look. It's fun and very easy to use. If you have frizzy hair then it will give you somewhat of a frizz but nothing serious. Not something I would use daily but for those days you want something different I would recommend.
7506,"This Stuff Works!_I am not sure how but my hair loss stopped in the first use and it was BAD. Granted, I am reviewing this only after using it one day but I am simply amazed at how wonderful and nourished and really healthy my scalp felt today and my hair looked great. I really can't believe it.If I were reading this, I would be skeptical but I guarantee to you that I am telling the truth. I can hardly believe it myself. I was not expecting such instant results.I will update after more prolonged use. So far, I am VERY pleased.UPDATE: Okay, I used this and the pills by the same company and handled my hair loss. I do believe this stuff works. My hair stopped falling out (more than normal) and it was falling out in clumps, to the point where I was so freaked out that I bought two wigs. I have not had to wear them though. I was sure with the amount of hair loss I was getting everyday that within weeks I would be almost bald. It was that bad. I am not kidding.Now, to be fair, I also did a lot of other things too like I stopped taking a certain drug that could have been the culprit but even so, that is not supposed to be an instant fix. I got on a better diet, starting sleeping more -- basically it was a wake up call to handle my health.That being said, I still feel these products helped right away."
7439,"Good conditioner_I am going to see if over time the product does help prevent split ends. Meanwhile, this conditioner has a mild scent and has the consistency of hand lotion. It applied easily and washed out without a problem. Overall I am pleased with it. I like the thick creamy conditioner.It was a helpful touch putting the spout on the bottom of the bottle. I don't have to shake it down anymore. Initially, I wondered if I would be cleaning up leaks. Nope. I just pop the spout open, squeeze some onto my hand, snap it closed and put it back on the shelf."
6649,The Best Conditioner Ever!_I tried the Dermorganic shampoo because it was recommended to me and I loved it so I ordered the Dermorganic Daily Hydrating Conditioner. I was using an other conditioner with the shampoo until this one came and it was night and day! Using them both together is what works. My comb goes thru my hair like butter when I wash it and my hair is half way to my waist and baby fine. I rarely have any tangles at all. Its the best combination I have ever had. I also added the Argan Oil Treatment with it and it will always be in my shower as long as it is available!
5577,"New HG_I've found my new holy grail sunscreen! I love that it has great protection, and it has a primer effect that is great for when I wear makeup."
8965,"Seems to work, my son does not like the smell_On several occasions that I used this sunscreen on my 6 year old son, it seemed to protect him from sunburns.  I like the sunscreen because it is advertised as chemical free, it is easy to apply, and it leaves no residue.However, my son said that he does not like the smell.  I agree that this product has a medicine-like or eucaliptus-like smell, but I think that it airs out quickly enough to ignore it.Additionally, the tube I received had the little round &#34;tamper-evident&#34; foil detached from the tip of the tube and stuck inside the lid, which prevented sunscreen from being dispensed.  Which makes me question manufacturer's production quality control.Overall, I think the biggest plus of this product is that it is advertised as natural."
8411,"DON'T Buy! not pigmented enough, doesn't last._the colors look great on the screen, but they are not as pigmented as i thought they would be. they don't cover at all, wear off, and are difficult to pick up on the brushes. I want my money back."
8450,Nice Deep Conditioner for Relaxed and Natural Hair_I tried this on my hair for conditioning because my hair can get dry from time to time.  It left my hair well conditioned and soft to the touch.  My hair felt nice.  I also tried it on a friend's hair who is African American.  She felt that it gave a good gloss to her hair and made it soft too.  She enjoyed the product.
4441,"burn, baby burn!_This will burn your fingers off!  I do not like it, nor do I recommend it.  You MUST use a heat glove.  It is cumbersome and difficult to use.  It now is taking up real estate in my drawer.  I should have returned it."
4940,"Don't care for off brands_I am sticking with Q-tips.  Every time I purchase an off brand, I am unhappy...so I am sticking with Q-tips.  I am grateful to have it delivered to my door with the subscribe and save discount."
8157,"Fabulous -- Better than a Blow Dryer_Fabulous product.  Can be used on dry , damp or wet hair.On very wet hair, fresh out of the shower, one time is not sufficient --  you must use it several times.I have wavy hair and this product made my hair nice and straight and gave it body.  Heats up very quickly and the soy lotion makes hair smooth.  Awesome product."
2228,"Warm, vanilla, not so much coconut_Can't really smell much coconut.  But it is a very deep, warm, rich vanilla.  Very warm.  I wouldn't describe it as a light scent.  It is deep.  I liked it.  It smells good after settling."
2740,Soft & durable_I bought this set over 2 years ago. I use the baby kabuki brush & eye shading brush daily and I wash them a few times a month and they have held up beautifully. The brushes are soft and make applying my BareMinerals powder makeup a breeze.
7016,Better than all high end cream eyeshadows_I love this product! It's great for when your running late or to pair with other eyeshadows. It's better than many of the high end cream eyeshadows I've used as well. Can't go wrong with this amazing product. I can't wait to get more colors.
4740,"Not for sensative skin._I have sensative skin and couldn't use this product. Would recommend for normal skin only. On a positive note, it does absorb well, has a nice texture, and a pleasant smell."
4590,Great moisturizing oil_I have very dry skin from an auto immune disease called Sjogren's Syndrome.  I put this oil on after washing my face and it has restored moisture!  It goes on easily and absorbs without leaving an oily surface! It's easy to wear under makeup.
3264,best primer out there_i love love love i have try almost every single primer out there from  urban decay to mac this works is easy to apply not messy at all it stays on all day long
1847,Nice one_Nice product we used and purchased from Amazon.Great product for eyebrows and eye shapes. Like this product.Thanks-HP
7587,"Great_These are great, very pretty and match the dotting tools that I had ordered previously. I haven't used them for acrylics YET, but I did look them over and they are like other acrylic brushes and see, to be of good quality."
2966,Love this!_I'm in my late forties and have begun to notice the difference in my skin.  I purchased the starter kit earlier in the year and could see an improvement in my skin after only a couple of weeks.  I was so happy to find the full size products at a discount price on Amazon. This product is worth the money!
3003,"Wonderful!_This mascara curls my lashes, keeps them separated. Very waterproof, also. I use it alone or over another mascara for more volume. Love it!"
1326,"i like this_semi greasy but that fades really quickly. i have very combination skin with very dry and oily patches, and this product works well for me. i love that the spf in this doesnt seem to break me out, also it does not smell like spf at all. it does not last very long though, and doesnt do anything particularly amazing for me, so i dont 'love' it. but all in all a great buy, i wish you got more for your money. would purchase again."
75,Excellent tone._Love the coverage because product is light and does not break out my skin.  Beautiful color and easy to apply.  Will buy again.
7804,"Great product_The wipes are really saturated so you get a good wiping session out of one piece. I've also never had a wipe rip while using. The canister is smaller than lysol cannisters so it fits in your car's cupholder, backpack's side pocket, etc. I buy these every time I go on a trip--camping, road trip, overnight stay--because it's convenient! I use it to clean my car, clean my counters, clean my dog's paws, etc."
8852,Not holographic_Not holographic at all..i have seen polishes that are much more holographic...not worth the buy. sorry.. felt like a waste of money.
1046,"Good for your feet_This has really helped me with dry feet and not just my heels, will probably buy again.  Economical as well."
8034,"Great buy!_I, personally, love Dove and this was a great deal for the price! Dove body wash works so well on my skin and has a light scent to it that just makes it perfect for me! And the shampoo is one of my favorites. I would definitely recommend buying this as a gift for a friend or a well-deserved gift for yourself:)"
9063,Not what I expected_I was hoping for a better color payoff than the one I got after using this product.
1265,"Okay, hair feels stripped_I tried the Absolut repair after my hair was damaged by highlights after a straight perm. It felt like it stripped my hair more, and my impression was that it wasn't much better than most drugstore brands. I do usually use salon products, and as far as a professional repairing conditioner, it didn't blow me away at all."
7131,"Little Bit Goes a Long Way_I am Caucasian and have enjoyed some of the Motions Naturally You products, even though they're primarily designed for women of color. This one is a little too intense for my hair type. I need just a tiny amount to run through my hair to get a shiny finish.The product has a mild scent. As an added benefit, it feels good on my skin, especially when it's dry in the winter."
9924,Emu oil is a great all around moisturizer._I have found my skin seems to be so dry the past few years. Moisturizing is hard work once you hit your 40's. It is a real struggle...at least for me.  I am always looking for something to really make a difference and keep my skin looking youthful.  I was intrigued to hear about Emu Oil. I find that I use the emu oil right after my shower and it keeps my skin looking smooth and eliminates that parched look. It has been lasting all day long. This is nice especially because the weather has been warmer and I wear dresses and skirts often. I don't want to look down and see dry legs.  Emu oil has eliminated that problem for me. I feel confident and professional all day long. I don't notice much of a scent but I like that because I can use my own perfume.  My skin can be sensitive but I have found no issues with the emu oil.  That really elevates Emu Oil and makes it a super skin moisturizer for me.  I have also used it after my shower to keep my hair and scalp moisturized. I just use a drop right out of the shower and gently rub it into my scalp and hair. I notice my hair styles so much nicer and looks great.
8602,fairly decent_This is a fairly decent product. It has a chemical aspect which I feel should be decreased but as it is with lysol their products have tradionally carried a chemical touch. The pump does work efficiently. There is no need to press twice. The container we used did not stick or clog up.
7388,"Love these!  Comfortable and affordable!_I have very long, thick hair and these hair clips hold ALL my hair up comfortably!  No pinching or hair coming down at all.  I'm in Aruba right now and the island tends to be windy and my hair stayed up all day.  I'll even say I don't make my twist tight and it still stayed in.  I've tried several types of clips and they don't work because of the thickness of my hair.  I'm definitely going to purchase another set to keep on hand.  They arrived on time and packaged in bubble wrap henceforth, no damage to them at all."
4268,"Just what I needed_I am in my 6th month of transitioning to natural. And recently, after thinking I'd finally conquered dryness, my hair became so dry!! No matter what I put on my hair, my hair was horribly dry (the natural part). I was really running out of ideas. I went to CVS and looked at the shelves, wondering what could possibly help. I bought the Curls Creme Brule and another product by Dark and Lovely Au Naturale called 10-1 Gelee. I first put the curls creme brule through a section of my hair, and noticed that it hydrated the natural part of my hair, causing curl definition. I then put the 10 in 1 over that same section and twisted--repeating for my entire head. I don't know how permanent the results will be. But my hair does feel hydrated. And so for now, I think I've found a solution to my dry, transitioning hair."
7874,Good packaging and quality_this is a nice buy for me although you really cant go wrong with gems a little just a little  fell out but not alot and I love the container it came in easier than the standard wheel most come in!
9067,"jo jo baltimore_Feels nice moisturizing without feeling heavy, and a very generous amount for the price! I love this before applying serum and moisturizer!"
7540,Organ oil_Nice oil that works wonderfully on cuticles or skin. I was so happy to find something that works so wonderfully.
7856,"This is great_I really like this case. It's well made and holds a lot of plates. It says it holds 84, but i put two (back to back) it each slot. Great product. Makes it easy to see what you have and to choose which plate you'd like to use. I'm very happy with it."
6866,okay_this product does not have a traditional blade. it bends the nail and then causes it to stretch and snap at the cutting point until it snaps off. leaves a nice edge though. hard to get a rounded cut with this until you have some serious practice.
3424,"Wonderful product_I apply a very small dab of this lightly across my cheeks, nose and chin after moisturizer and before foundation. What a difference! Using the other same two products, but not this, the foundation doesn't go on as smoothly and I can see tiny streaks from my fingers and other minor application problems. Using this, I get a beautiful smooth, matte finish that stays moist all day. I absolutely love this product."
4310,Healthy Wear Makeup_Easy to use and stays on.  Would order this again.
3435,"There are better anti-aging products with less toxic ingredients_Olay Regenerist products use methylparaben and other ingredients that the Environmental Working Group, on its site the Cosmetic Safety Database, has identified as toxic.  So while this product works okay and is reasonably priced, it really isn't a bargain.  If money is an issue and you aren't worried about putting these chemicals on your skin, you will probably like this product, but I'd rather spend more money and buy something more natural, or at least less toxic, that works just as well or better."
1554,"Works well_Really like this product. Love that it is a safer moisturizer with SPF as found on ewg's website. Moisture is okay. Some days I add a little of my regular moisturizer to my face after I apply this. May need something different in winter? The only problem I have with this is that when I apply makeup some of the moisturizer comes off in white flakes - even after it's dried for a while on my face before makeup. Not a big deal, easy to brush off. Will buy again."
4474,"Really works! and moisturizes too_this product is awesome - it gives a boost to a base tan or maintains it with a natural looking color, evens out tan lines, and even leaves skin feeling moisturized. my sister, mom and i use it on our faces and bodies about every other day.note: do not put on cracked-dry skin, like feet, because it will turn really dry cracks orange.will also make cuticles orange but that comes out with normal hand-washing.not sure if it works if you have no base tan ..."
757,Great product_I have used this hair dryer for several years now and it is a winner. I even take it on trips with me because I cannot stand the hotel hair dryers now--they take too long and my hair gets frizzy. Prepare to be spoiled.
3028,"same pleased !_it has the same job as for brown mascara, Love it Love it!!! will keep buying and hope the price will not go up :))))"
4010,"Surprisingly great_I received a sample of this in a Burt's Bees sampler for christmas. I have had moderate acne for 15 years and have not yet found a product that will get rid of it completely (except when I was on Accutane, which I got off of and acne came back the next year). This scrub started to show an improvement in my acne within 2 days. I was surprised because it feels greasy when scrubbing it on and rinsing it off, but after I use a toner after the scrub, my face feels clean and moisturized. Has not gotten rid of my acne, but helps it enough to where I purchased the full size."
4017,"Great gentle makeup remover and cleanser._Great gentle makeup remover and cleanser. Does not have much of a scent, does not irritate skin and if you get it in your eyes it burns less than soap and water (which is how I used to remove my makeep; NOT good)."
916,Gorgeous_I am in love with any Urban Decay eyeliner and I have tried many brands. These stand out and get u noticed. Worth the money. I want all their colors. Cruelty free which is key.
2522,"Great nail tool_I bought this to use on my cuticles before polishing with gel/shellac polish. It turns out, it's awesome for scraping off that polish after soaking. I don't know what I would do without it."
4955,"Fabu-licious_This color is like molten metal that just shimmers and shines, but without being too overpowering or ostentatious. I know, hard to imagine molten metal as being understated, but it really kinda is - and goes with everything!"
1893,"Great mascara_The only mascara that has stood the test of time with me.  I've been using this formula for years and have tried others, but they just don't compare."
2036,"Pure Cosmetics_This is the very first product I ever tried from this company. I had read that someone didn't like the coffee aroma... Bingo! That meant it had coffee in it and I knew that coffee was good for reducing bags under the eyes. Plus, I love the smell of coffee. I keep a tube in my glove compartment and apply it under my eyes at the red lights. I also put it under my chin to stimulate the little flabby waddle I have ...seems to be more defined now. I like their products."
8364,"Chalk from the art store is better._I bought these and I was seriously disappointed. They didn't stay in very long and Heaven forbid if  you had to brush your hair after chalking it. It brushed right out! Hard Pastel Chalk sticks from the local Art store last much longer, are brighter, you can get more colours, and won't brush out. Plus you can buy 32 stick that are 3 times the size of these for $5 while this cost three times that. I would NEVER recommend these to anyone I know."
7415,"Adds shine to anything!_I've been waiting to find this polish for quite a while now, and I'm glad I finally have. You can literally add shine of the times on top of any other polish, to get various effects. It is a gorgeous top coat!"
8755,Very satisfied_Just received it in the mail. The colors are even more beautiful in person. Yes the smell is a little strong but I'm used to it.
498,"Don't accept cheap imitations!_I have long hair, sometimes down to my waist, and this is the best brush I have ever used for getting all the tangles out.  I've tried look alike brushes only to have the handle snap off or have the bristle bed pull out of the handle after a week or two.  So don't waste your money on cheap drugstore brushes (which cost $5.99) when you can get this wonderful brush for only $11.  Trust me, the Denman will last for years."
5817,"Very good exfoliation_I like the mitt, but it's not something you can use everyday.  I only use it once a week because it is very effective at doing its job."
9484,No more crocodile-dry skin!_I've been trying Argan Alchemy for some very positive results.  I have extremely dry skin and I'm quite embarrassed with my ashen white legs. I've tried many moisturizing lotions to help but honestly do not like how the lotion feels on my skin.  It had a very light consistency and had an almost close to no scent.  The Argan Oil nourishes the skin because it is quickly absorbed into the skin. My legs showed a much more healthier skin glow by adding 3 drops of Argan Alchemy Argan Oil to my leg. Love this stuff!
7706,omg_ditto for this wig as the short one I purchased so managable doesnt get tangly and dreaded easy to pick out gently I usually wash it in baby shampoo and conditioner in ice water for about three days for all my wigs really and this one just I dont even have to pick it half the time..I know the price is unreal but the wig is more sereal than anything...dawn
298,"I've been using this since I was a teen!_I really love this face soap. My stepmom turned me on to it when I was a teenager (it is what she used) to battle acne...It was such a miracle worker. It is really gentle and soft. The scent is really light too. My face feels clean but not destroyed - you know how many facial products &#34;clean&#34; your face, but then after, it's like every trace of the good oils on your skin were just stripped away? Well, this leaves the good stuff on your face so you feel clean but soft. I know it is a pricier soap, but a little bit goes a very, very long way. I literally just take my wet hand and rub it ONCE on the soap which gets enough soap to clean my face. I have also used it on my body when I ran out of  Dr. Bronner's, and it feels great on the body, too (but I am too cheap to use it as a body soap!). I highly recommend this. I have been using this for over 20 years now."
3863,"Nyx Products, Love Them!_Love the Color and I love Nyx lipstick it glides on easy..I use all kind of lipstick that is alot more money at your High end stores But I have to be honest this to me wears longer and makes my lips really soft.. If you like Orange this is it.."
6153,"Great hand cream_I used to use expensive hand creams from the Body Shop and other pricey stores. Now I have found this hand cream on Amazon after trying and loving the Neutrogena foot cream. This hand cream keeps my hands from cracking in the cold, dry Michigan winters."
9260,"Look no further for the perrrfect eyelash curler, you've found it!_Amazing curls are done by this particular eyelash curler. It is everything you want in a curler!! Plus you get 5, yes, 5 refill cushions!!! I just got it today & I am already in love! Definitely interested in the other products Crave Naturals has to offer!!! :)"
1193,EXCELLENT PRODUCT_Where has this been all my life!  I don't apply my make up without it. It is a must have in your kit. ..the cleanser is amazing.
2420,"love it_Bought to try out a new product. Love it. Got so many compliments. Not shiny or glittery, which is what I was looking for. Just wanted something for contouring, and bronzing. A little goes a long way. Love it. Will purchase again soon. Might even try out other products by the balm. I would say if you have pale skin, this maybe a littledark for you. Olive dark tan skin tone."
4697,"Too Expensive For What You Get_And, it's hard to tell how much product is being dispensed with the brush.  This is the second Colorscience product I've purchase and been disappointed both times."
4946,It's okay_Not as dark as I thought nothing special till u add some sparkle to it then it Wonderful and Elegant looking so if u buy buy a glitter gel too
9344,"A very good moistureizer_This is a very good product. I have tried several different types of creams, moisturizers but found out that anything containing vitamin c is very good for the skin.  It will take a little time to notice the difference, but it will happen.  I recommend you try this product."
4218,"Absolutely love this for my fine waves!_I started following the Curly Girl method (no silicones or sulfates) just under six months ago, and some Curl Junkie products --including this Curl Creme Lite -- were amongst the first few products I ordered.  I absolutely love the CJ line, but this particular product, combined withCurl Junkie Curls In A Bottle!, 12 fl. oz., leave me with consistently great-looking hair!  (For more information about the Curly Girl method, seeCurly Girl: The Handbook.)My hair is wavy and fine, but I have a lot of it, and using this really brings out the waves and also gives my fine hair the protein that it needs.  I use about three or four quarter-sized dollops of this on my shoulder-length hair, top with some Curls in a Bottle, and add someFarouk Systems Biosilk Style By Farouk Systems For Women. Rock Hard Gelee Firm Hold 6.0-Ounce / 150 Mlto hold the waves.  The result are waves that help make my hair the best it's ever looked.I also use a small dab of this on my second-day hair to revive it and keep it looking fresh.This also has a wonderful smell to it that's a combo of coconut and coffee.Although the bottle is about 8 ounces, it lasts a long time since you use so little.  I use it about twice a week, and am about half-way through the bottle.Overall, a great product and one of my Holy Grail hair products!"
9476,"Great Facial Scrubber_I loved this sponge.  It has just enough grittiness on it to remove dead skin.  My skin feels softer and less coarse after using this.  I usually just use my facial cleaning gel and my face feels clean.  I started using this sponge after lathering my face, and what a difference if makes.  Its easy to hold and there's a little indent on the flat side that makes it easier to clean your nose and chin.I think I like it better than my prosonic.  No need to recharge this just buy a new one."
4514,"At 46, this is what my skin needs, without peeling or pain!_After spending over $40,000 (yes) for prescription products at plastic surgeons' offices and hundreds of over the counter products, I have to say that this gentle peel does what it says!  The first time I used it, I didn't listen and put it on my lips and left it on for like an hour. Shame on me!  My lips burned and peeled, but my face didn't suffer.  Now, I use it for the designated time and after applying it from forehead to chest, I leave it on for 10 minutes.  As a 46-year-old woman, I can see how it wouldn't be needed for someone in their 20's at all, but over 40, this works!  My face is tighter all over (I do put it directly under my eyes and eyelids cause I don't follow ALL the directions), and it's lighter, like I used a hyperpigmentation cream (none of those work).  The results last only a couple days, and you are supposed to use this once a week to achieve solid results.  I use it the day before or even the day of a special outing or event, so my face is tight and smooth, and your makeup will go on nicely.  From all the products out there, this one is by far #1 on my list for quick, effective peels without burning or peeling, and you can go out right after you use it!  I look awake, refreshed, tighter, and my chest area looks smoother and lighter as well. When your read all these reviews, some don't tell their age.  If you are over 40, I highly recommend this product for a woman or man!  For the price compared to doctor's office products and some over-the-counter products that don't work, this is one month's worth of peels, and it's well worth the cost!"
7486,"5 Star Product!_My hair is very dry and my scalp is very prone to dandruff. Usually without an extensive dandruff treatment that leaves my hair really really dry, my dandruff never goes away. Washing it will sometimes make it better for a day or two, but that's about it.This is first shampoo I've tried that doesn't dry my hair out AND gets rid of dandruff. I usually wash my hair every 7 to 10 days. I haven't had a dandruff problem between shampoos since I've been using it, which has been about a month. It feels good on my scalp, leaves my hair soft, and it smells good, too. ^_^I think is probably best for anyone with dandruff or a problem with excess oil or product buildup on the scalp.The conditioner that goes along with this is equally impressive."
3226,Organix Passionfruit Guava Conditioner_I will start off by saying I love all organix products. this one also makes my hair feel super soft and it smells pretty good. the Passionfruit Guava is my not favorite smelling but it is not bad at all. I have never had hair loss like some of the other reviews with organix. I would definitely recommend it :)
4665,"Very refreshing face gel!_I do love this face gel, it feels fantastic on my crazy parched skin.  I have sensitive skin, and I use retinol, which makes my face peel and turn red the next day (not a good look!).  I have tried countless face creams, and they either make my face more irritated, or don't help at all with the peeling, even after a few reapplications.  Just one swipe of this makes my skin cool and completely moisturizes it-no more peeling! I can't believe it! This is just a fantastic face cream and the price on amazon is several dollars cheaper than in the stores.  I love it! It doesn't break me out at all, and almost everything else does! I do use it during the day as well as at night, so I wish it had a sunscreen for the day. That is the only negative thing I can say about it. It's still worth it!! If you are on the fence, just try it! You will be so impressed! Use it a few times, and for a crazy burst of freshness, store it in the fridge.  Awesome!"
1939,"Great_I thought I reviewed thus but I didn't. It was the lotion. Both are great. Gives me a omg I just realized the product I was reviewing. Lmao. This is AMAZING!!!! I LOOOOOOVE the smell. Ugh. This took me to the spa and back. I couldn't stop sniffing myself. Only drawback was that because it smells so good and leaves you soft and moisturizes and wait. That's not a drawback. But people may sniff you. I mean literally. I had it several times. Like and couldn't stop and kept walking by me at work or friends while I'm out. It gets weird but its funny because I know it smells omg it smells so good. The drawback was that I would over shower and waste it because it felt so good and smelled divine. I used it up fast. Lol. That was the drawback. But if you have self control, I recommend this highly. I love their products. This honey one is in my top fav"
6594,"Perfect for Makeup_Depending on what you use QTips for, these could be very useful. I use them to clean up or smudge eyeliner. They are perfect for eye make up and for manicures!"
2733,works!!_I have really curly hair.. but of course I straightened it before putting these on.anyway the curls look pretty. I like it.. but had a hard time getting the rollers on at firststill do kinda lol // gonna master these rollers sometime this summer lol
3605,"My new fave!_This is a very rich and gorgeous dark red color. I love it! It's my new favorite. And it lasts forever. You can eat meals and it won't fade. Be sure to keep the color on the outside of your lips and let them dry, or you'll get it on your teeth and while it doesn't stain your teeth, it's a bit harder to get off than your normal lipstick."
8384,great price!_This works great and the price is great! Ive been using it about once a week. Its less painful and less irritating to the skin then manually squeezing (which you shouldnt do anyways) your blackheads and whiteheads. I was always bugging my husband to let me remove his blackheads on his face and he wouldnt let me come near him because he said i hurt him. Now he's been using this little gadget himself! I just wahs it with soap and water or rub it with a cotton ball and alcohol after each use. I'm very happy with this purchase.
6407,I must have gotten a lemon..._Wow. All the positive reviews here floored me. I've had my brush for about a month and it's still shedding like crazy. I can't believe how many little black hairs I have to pick off my face each morning after I use this brush. I bought this brush to replace a MAC large powder that also shed uncontrollably. Maybe it's me? I decided to replace this brush with one of Sigma's Sigmax brushes. I love those.
5426,"Less frizz-  cheaper than Wen_I read reviews of the product &#34;Wen&#34;, and saw that it was expensive.  Reviewers recommended Hair ONE as an alternative, being just as effective and less costly.  I have not tried Wen, but am very satisfied with the results from Hair ONE.  I have &#34;older&#34; fine, curly hair.  It tends to get frizzled ends.  This product helps my hair to feel very soft, and with more control.You do need to take a few more minutes with the product and leave it on.  I start by wetting my hair, applying the product, and putting on a cheap plastic shower-cap for a few miunutes while I do other things.  Then I get into the shower and continue with the routine.  I have short hair, and use less than the directions suggest.  But I am hoping to be able to let my hair grow a bit longer by using this product and not feeling the need to get my hair trimmed as often as before.  You do NOT need a separate shampoo and conditioner, so the price is OK."
6927,"Like_Good hairspray. Goes on nice, but a little goes a long way, so use sparingly or else it will crunch."
7132,"Another good product for frizzy hair_I was told many years ago, that one way to tame my crazy, frizzy, cowlicked hair is with products made for 'natural' hair, and I have found this to be true. I have thick blonde hair that also tends to look dull.  I have used regular serums, but had trouble getting it to spread throughout my hair.  This product works better.  I could never use 2 or 3 pumps though, one pump in my palm, rub my hands together and then rub into my dried hair and I get the control I need.  I also like the shine I get from using it, and I have gotten compliments after using it."
9870,"Lifts and firms as promised!_My wife have been using it before.It took a few months for her to see the results, but she's very happy with the product now.It definitely does reduce fine lines and wrinkles.She has tried at least a dozen other anti aging creams that promised to lift, firm, tighten yada yada yada but nothing has come close to working as good as it.She's just absolutely love it and  will stay with it."
5594,Overall---great_I love the color! I love how long the color lasts! Yet the smell and taste not that great. It also dries out my lips a bit.
2371,"Great for post-peel moisturizing_I only use this  emu oil to moisturize after a TCA peel. I love it because it doesn't make me eventually break out, which some other post-peel products do. It is rather oily but still might also be a good nighttime moisturizer."
2168,Like this product_Seems light enough for my brows and goes in gently and not gloppy. I do use an eyebrow bruch after applying. I tend to rub my eyes so need to be careful not to roll it off as it will kind of flake off vs smear. I was using a light brown eye shadow but it seemed to wear off too easily so this product was an improvement.
3107,"False Advertising_The brush you get may look NOTHING like this brush.  The brush I received is much too big for a cosmetic bag you would carry in your purse.  It's 1 inch in diameter and 4 inches long.  The case is bronze and not silver.Amazon really needs to make this seller correct the picture.If you want a big brush in a bronze case, go for it.  If you want what's pictured, move along.Update:  Contacted Seller Cosmetics Solutions and they wrote back immediately offering a refund."
2417,"Can't live with out it!_It smells a little bit of light citrus 'orange smell' which is not totally noticeable for me but nice in the morning. It's a clear gel like substance with orange bursting beads that melt away when you apply it to the face. I have oily skin and it defiantly leaves me face feeling clean, hydrated and smooth. I also have sensitive skin and I like this product so much that I do use it twice a day in the morning and before I go to bed and it doesn't make my skin break out what so ever."
8295,Moisturizing conditioner_This is another new Suave product that I am pleased with. The Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner has good slip and moisturized my hair pretty well. The moroccan oil is a nice addition to the formula. I look forward to reviewing more of these new products.
3289,"works, all natural_ok, i actually don't know if it works yet, we haven't had a really sunny day here yet.  I got this after doing a lot of research to replace my DeVita solar50, which they changed the recipe.  It had been my favorite sunscreen then it turned my face white with big flecks.  This smells interesting and i will have to see if i burn or not later in summer."
8726,Love this stuff_Have the conditioner as well. Love these products. They smell great and make my hair feel healthy. My bottles are empty and I am re-ordering them.
7138,"Softer hair, pleasant smelling_One of the drawbacks of putting certain products in your hair is the smell.  This product smells nice, although it is faint.  I have used another product by Pantene for almost 3 years - it doesn't smell as nice.My hair is definitely softer too, whereas with the other product, my hair felt 'crisper'... as in stiffer.The trick is finding the right amount to use.  If you under apply or over apply, you will be disappointed."
369,Beautiful color_I was a bit hesitant to buy this lipstick...due to my skin tone...but it works!  It is a shade of red with a bit of coral in it..not a blue-red but a yellow-red.  It is bright!  I usually apply once and the color lasts a long time.  This is not a 'looks like I don't have lipstick on' shade.  Gorgeous!
2484,Great for unshinyness_I put it on as a finishing powder - makes it look more natural - also good for fake eyebrows as a finishing touch to make them not look so fake
7070,awesome_There is nothing I have tried that compares to this shampoo.leaves hair soft for days I will continue to use it.
7279,"The name did not provide the experience_This did not give me volume for 48 hours.  I have lots of fine, blonde hair that I am always searching for the ultimate product to give me volume, movement, and hold all in one.  All I expected from this product was the volume.  I felt like it weighed my hair down, extended dry time and I saw no noticeable difference with and without my other product line up.  Finally, Alterna products are far too expensive to not fulfill SOME of their promises!"
7502,"Good but not great_I was hoping this would be as good as or better than what I think is the best, Shiseido's, but this one was just ok. Shiseido's is the ultimate best and while this one does not pinch (a big plus) it doesn't give you a great curled eyelash either."
4253,"I love this perfume_My boyfriend likes slightly sweeter scented perfumes, and Sarah Jessica Parker's NYC is great, but it just doesn't last.  The Sarah Jessica Parker line of scents is great, like Covet and Dawn and NYC, but NYC just doesn't last."
3488,"Perfect shape for blending_I particularly love blending with this brush.  I have two - on one, the head falls off once in a while (I just shove it back on), but on the other, no problems.  The bristles stay put, easy to clean, just the right balance of firm and soft.  And, a great blender."
1378,"This is the Best Place to Purchase at this Price_This dudu-osun is a very good bar of soap and I usually pay $4 a bar plus my entire family uses it so I normally get it in packs of 24. My teenage son loves it because it keeps his skin clear and even toned. He had very dark acne scars but they have faded so much that you can hardly tell they were ever there not to mentioned his face is probably a shade if not two lighter than before. I have a 10yr old son (who is Albino) and a 9yr old daughter (who has extra dry skin). They both use it with no issue and my hubby who works in a chemical plant loves how clean he feels out of the shower. When anyone is bathing, you will know it, the entire house smells like a very tropical place.I considered giving it three stars because I can't use this soap, it gives me a burning sensation all over my body and my face is irritated for days afterwards. But since my cheeks, nose & chin have become so smooth in the little time I did, I'd like to give it a 4.5. My pores have practically vanished and I have some acne scarring that's improved significantly. I do use the dudu-oson from time to time on my face knowing that even though I am going to pay for it, my skin will be glowing."
9736,"A beautiful scent and product_I have gotten two of these Caress Body Wash products to review. I loved them both but prefered this Emerald Rush over the Aqua Sparkle.The smell on this product is very pretty and light, not overpowering. Often Gardenia products can be overwhelming (but I love it so the more the better!) but this is strong in the bottle but light on the skin.  The scent did not change like the other product did. It did leave just the lightest hint of fragrance after which is lovely.It's a good quality body wash. It's very thick and concentrated, so you don't have to use a lot of it.  It leaves you clean and soft without any dryness.  The bottle is easy to hold and open with wet/soapy hands.Overall I love it and highly recommend!"
1136,"Strong spray bottle_Surprising strong spray!  I used this for a number of things - wetting my hair for styling, blasting spider egg sacs off the window screens, misting my plants, etc.  For a little effort, you get a lot done.  Will be buying more for dedicated usage"
145,"Cuts down on frizz_I bought this towel to wrap around my hair because normal bath towels make my hair frizzy. This towel definitely cuts down on frizz and makes my hair look much more tame. It is the perfect size to wrap my head with and does not feel to heavy on it. The only issue I have with this towel is that it is not as absorbent as I need it to be. If I had fine to normal hair, I would probably give this product 5 stars. However, I have a lot of thick, curly hair that sops up water like a sponge so I need a little more absorbency than this towel provides. Overall, I would say to give this towel a try. There's a reason why it has got so many good reviews."
1309,"Great product, great price!_I love this bottle, it's much bigger than I thought it was going to be but that's a plus. It will hold an entire bottle of nail polish remover. It pushes down with ease and has a lid that snaps tight so I never have to worry about it spilling."
3286,"Not Just for Acne_I really like this face wash. It's very gentle, and leaves my skin feeling clean without drying it out. I like the consistency of it. Not runny, but easy enough to spread around, although be sure to wet your face before using it. A smidge goes a long way, so this tube will last a long time. This is great for those people who would like to use it on their chest and back, as it won't cost an arm and a leg. It rinses off easily with no greasy feeling, or residue left behind. After using it for a week, my skin feels softer and smoother. A good product for people with acne, but, with its gentle exfoliation, I think any skin type would benefit from it.Fragrance is listed in the ingredients, but it's very light. I barely notice it, and it doesn't linger once I've rinsed it off.The one thing I don't like is the cap. It's slanted, making it a bit awkward for left-handed people. Why it's like that is beyond me. It doesn't seem to serve any useful purpose, and it doesn't come off, so there's no way around it.Good product, great value. Cap notwithstanding, I will buy this again."
2803,"Lotion_Great lotion, great price, and quality.  I priced the lotion at WalMart and Target, not even close to your price and per ounces per bottle."
3821,Great go-to_Love this palette and I use it everyday for on camera news. These shades are not super pigmented and completely matte which is what I was looking for. I use the contour shade the most but when i have too much application of either blush or contour the flesh tone helps to blend it out and tone it down.
6272,Completely Worth It!_When This Product Came I Loved How It Was Packed! Very Nice and Neat! The Plates Work Pretty Good. The Only Thing I Had a Problem With  Was The French Tip Designs. They did Not Stamp Well. It Could Just Be Me Though.If Some Designs don't Work Well You Cant Complain And Give Bad Reviews Because You Get 25 Plates for Just $9.00!! So Considering What you Get And For The Price This Is A Great Deal!!! Worth It!!
5854,"Didn't work for me_This product did not work for me.  I've given this several attempts.  I live in a hot area and thought it may be the weather, but even when I am indoors the entire day, this does not set my make up."
724,"Perfect replacement_I had exactly this model and was crushed when it died after 8 years of loyal service. I cannot say enough good things about this straightener, like I said I had the last one for a long time and used it very often, almost every day. Its also sturdy I threw it in and out of more suitcases and drawers than I can count and it truly stood the test of time. This is the only straighter I will ever buy."
3357,"Expensive, but worth it_This stuff seems SO good. I highly recommend this. I just put it in an old softsoap pump and it has lasted such a long time. I've had this product for months and I still have some left. It's a great value when you do this."
5627,"actually works, quick and easy_I have thick wavy hair, I recommend having your hair wet. It gave me a fresh textured look, it looks amazing (at least to me). The bubble was hard to keep centered, but i don't know if it really matters. Invest in one if you plan on not going to the salon anymore or just maintaining your layered hair already. Comes in handy for split ends"
1385,"Favorite color of all time_I love Lincoln Park After Dark!  It is my favorite color of all time.  You only need two coats and you get the total effect.  It is a mix of black, burgandy, and a blood red.  It looks amazing on.  It is just dark enough but not too dark like a black that sometimes is too harsh.  The brush is great and as always love OPI:)"
1621,"Lifesaver in a box!_My eyebrows are thin from overplucking and light from who knows what. Most likely ProActiv (which contains something that lightens hair so be careful, but great product as well.) So needless to say I had to use a brow pencil just so you could even see my eyebrows and that just doesn't look very natural on me unless i'm having a good eyebrow day. lol I was scared to order this because I was afraid I might accidently dye my skin or it might come out too dark or red hued or something could just potentially go wrong and I'd regret it. Honestly though it was SO easy even for my first time, it was so quick to process, I have light brows so I did 3 minutes for each brow to make them a dark brown. Be careful not to get it on your skin because it'll stain it but after 2 times of washing your face that night and the next morning with whatever exfoliator/face wash it'll go away on it's own. The color doesn't last for 6 weeks by any means. I'd say 4 but still for the price, how easy it is and the fact that you get 4 dyes in 1 box, it's worth it. I never buy anything else and I couldn't be happier with how quick you can do this and how great the price is. I highly recommend this product!"
2910,"Acne problem solved!_I have battled acne for about 3 years now. It all started after I gave birth to my son. I read the reviews on this cleaning bar and decided to give it a try. It has drastically cleared up my face in combination with Dickinson's witch hazel. I would suggest this to anyone who has any kind of acne issue as I had it all. I had cystic acne, black heads, & white heads. I do still get some breakouts (mainly due to forgetfulness) but all in all, this has given me great confidence with my face."
6829,works great_I love it I use at least 4 times a week the only problem is they do not sell replacement brushes
9346,Size is very small._This might be a good product but is a crazy small size for the price.  This will last me only a few uses.  I appreciate organic but need to have a good value in products that I buy.  I should've been more careful reading the description when I ordered.
376,"Most Unique Blush Ever!_I absolutely love this color. It's beautiful.The pigmentation is crazy good. I am light skinned and It looks great on me. This is a great blush for everyone, don't be afraid of the color, you just have to work with a very light hand."
794,"Not great- many other better choices for less_I bought this product about a month ago after reading about it in a few magazines as a wonder product. The marketing buzz was the wonder, not the product. It leaves my hair feeling 'crisp' rather than soft even when I blow dry. My stylist recently recommended Moroccan Oil and used it before a blow-out. Loved the way my hair looked and felt after that product. I'd recommend it or a few other cheaper products over this one. Feels gloppy out of the bottle and stiff on the hair. Too bad I wasted $20 on it."
7139,"It might be how you use it....._My teenage daughter also tried this product and thought it was okay. For those or you who have to have 100% natural products this product is not for you. It has at least five ingredients that most naturals stay away from such as mineral oil. It was not that serious for her, especially because she don't use this product everyday. All she cared about was how her hair looked and felt once it was styled. She was pretty impressed by the texture, consistency and smell of the product. The overall result was a thumbs down, for now at least. I say for now because I think she may have used too much of the product which caused her hair to become ridiculously greasy when it dried. Or maybe that's just how the product works. Who knows. She will, however, give it another try, this time with less product and see if she get the same result. As for my recommendation, all hair is different so its really up to you to fine out."
6853,"One Star_boo. cheap, don't buy."
2189,not that great_This is ok for a cleanser but I did not see any other benefits and for the price there should be more you get out of it.
7110,Great Post-Peel Cream_This cream is amazing. I only use it after peel but I am very happy with it. I choose organic stuff for daily use but for a few days after my peels this stuff is GREAT!  I wish it had less chemicals but I will take the good with the bad.
7242,Clean I've been looking for!_I really found this product to fit my needs and expectations. It smells great and gives me that clean feeling I was searching for.
3453,"All I Can Say Is WOW_I love this product.  I have dark circles below and on my lids, and between the bridge of my nose, and broken capillaries on my face and this product absolutely covers it all.  It took me about a week to master the application and this is what I learned. 1)  Less is more,  this product is buildable.  2) Apply the product with your fingertip and tap it into your skin.  Don't rub it in. It takes a very small amount of this product.  I use about 3 pinhead amount.  This product is expensive but you get your money's worth and because it takes such a small amount this product will last a very long time.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT."
2558,"Cannot Live Without This Product for Acne & Skin Renewal_I have been using this exact brand and product for three years and have had cystic acne my entire life. I have been on Accutane four times before it was banned as well. This cream keeps my cystic acne at bay when I use it every single day. I am now 47 and my skin is firm and I do not have a lot of wrinkles because of this cream. I have very oily skin, especially on my forehead, nose area and chin. I use it on my neck and chest as well, and my sister (sorry, sis!) has a really wrinkled neck (she is 48)! I have none.This product does NOT get rid of hyperpigmentation! This product will NOT get rid of pitted scars, either. But your skin will become smoother after a few months of use.About every 28 days, your skin will get tight and develop a layer of skin and you will look a bit older, because that skin needs to exfoliate. You know when it starts to get harder and you start to get dry skin, in 3 days, it will begin to come off. I use a BufPuf and Clean & Clear Continuous Acne Control every day, too. When that skin comes off, your skin is softer than a baby's bottom and you look 5-10 years younger. If you exfoliate too hard, as I do sometimes, your skin will be very tender. If you put it on when you took all that skin off, your face will burn some and start to build up again, so use a little less when you have fresh, renewed skin.This product significantly keeps my skin very firm and wrinkles at bay, and it forces my skin to renew and slough off once a month. This is important, especially for those who see sagging skin on their cheeks (mine are literally as tight as a drum when you pat them!).Be careful about using it close to the under eye area, as it might burn a bit and will turn harder and slough off as well. I don't put it that close often, but once in a while I put a little bit there to exfoliate it (but I shouldn't) and it helps.For those who don't mind the build up of skin 3 days a month and amazing, soft, smooth and supple skin you get, you will love this product. Use it every day for 30 days, without fail before you make any decisions. You need to wait until you get that first exfoliation after one month, and you see that fresh, new skin. It's just like having a mini-acid peel every month, but a lite version.I have used it for 3 years and hope they don't ever stop making it, because there is literally nothing like it on the market over the counter or through a prescription. But give it time. Those who expect a dramatic result in 1 day or 1 week are unrealistic. The snails secrete glycolic acid and collagen naturally, and that is very pricey at any plastic surgeon's office. You get those products naturally here, for thousands less over time.The cream turns clear and smells like absolutely nothing. I am oily already, so I don't get the one with the lotion. Also, I put this on, blow dry my face for one minute, and then I put a light coat of Maximum Strength Clearasil over it because it's a bit greasy for me. I might get a pimple once every few months and that's it! I've bought $150 and higher products that do nothing for wrinkles and acne.I wrote this to help those with unrealistic expectations and for those who have patience and have spent a fortune like me who will know that in 6 months, you will look at least 5 years younger! And no, I am not selling this product, just using it :)"
9163,"I don't have eczema, but I *have* had radiation therapy..._I do not have eczema, but after receiving radiation therapy for breast cancer, my skin has suffered greatly. Not just in the immediate aftermath of the radiation, but even long after, my skin breaks out in irritated spots and has trouble healing. This cream is one of the best I have found for helping skin to feel less itchy and sore and to help it heal. Very grateful for this and will recommend to others who have gone through the same thing."
2703,"This is a nice, economical lotion the whole family can use ..._My husband has always enjoyed Vaseline products because he doesn't care to have to be stingy and put on a thin layer of any lotion.  He loves being able to slather it on after a shower or any time he feels the need to moisturize.  He has very dry skin and although there are products out there that 'claim' to do a better job, he's come back to Vaseline every time.  There are now four new Vaseline lotions out there and he's trying all of them.  He's in lotion heaven and his favorite is the Cocoa Radiant.These lotions are not fragrance free, but don't claim they are.  They do have light, refreshing scents that are not cloying and don't linger in the air.  One of the nicest things is that a couple of these are now Amazon Add-Ons, something I've come to appreciate when I'm running low on an item, but don't want to run off to the store for a single item.Total Moisure, Pure Oat ExtractINGREDIENTS:Water, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Glycol Stearate, Petrolatum, Isopropyl Palmitate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Sunflower Seed Oil Or Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Protein, Sodium Stearoyl-2-Lactylate, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A Palmitate), Carbomer, Lecithin, Keratin, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Sodium Pca, Potassium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Collagen Amino Acids, Mineral Water, Fragrance, Triethanolamine, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Urea, Methylparaben, Dmdm Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Disodium Edta, Titanium Dioxide.Cocoa RadiantINGREDIENTS:Water, Petrolatum, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Isopropyl Palmitate, Glycol Stearate, Dimethicone, Theobroma Cacao Seed Butter (Cocoa), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter) (Shea Butter), Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil or Glycine Soja Oil (Sunflower, Soybean), Glycine Soja Sterol (Soybean), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A Palmitate), Sodium Stearoyl 2 Lactylate, Collagen Amino Acids, Urea, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Carbomer, Lecithin, Mineral Water, Sodium PCA, Potassium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Fragrance (Parfum), Stearamide AMP, Triethanolamine, Methylparaben, DMDM Hydrantoin, Disodium EDTA, Caramel, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)Aloe FreshINGREDIENTS:Water, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Glycol Stearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Petrolatum, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil or Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Sodium Stearoyl-2-lactylate, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A Palmitate), Panthenol (Provitamin B5), Sodium Acrylate/Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Lecithin, Mineral Water, Sodium Pca, Potassium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Collagen Amino Acids, Urea, Fragrance, Triethanolamine, Dmdm Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Disodium Edta, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891).Men Body and Face LotionIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Glycol Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Petrolatum, Fragrance, Triethanolamine, Isopropyl Palmitate, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Carbomer, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propyl Paraben, Disodium Edta, Titanium Dioxide."
5307,"Will continue to use_My wife likes Aveeno products, so we tried this shampoo.  I don't color my hair, but my wife does.  And to be honest, I'm not as picky about shampoos as my wife.  I just want my hair clean.  With that said, this shampoo cleaned my hair just fine.  I don't know that I'd pay the higher price for it, but when I asked my wife what she thought, she really liked this shampoo.My wife liked the scent as well as the lather and how the shampoo left her hair.  It's a product she wants to continue to buy and use."
9657,"Quality product from Olay_After a month of usage, this has proven to do its job well.  It definitely makes the skin smoother, and remains feeling soft even after washing it off.  The moisturizer is thick but doesn't feel greasy on the skin, a common problem in my experience.  For people with oily skin, this is definitely a big plus.  It contains SPF 30 it protects the skin nicely, and those with light or fair skin this will come in very handy.  The pump is very easy to use and dispenses a perfect amount of moisturizer for the face.  There is no waste whatsoever with a single pump of the bottle.  Recommended."
5325,"One of my favorite brands_I have 3 favorite brands and though I like this brand, this was not my favorite scent.  It freshens you but does not leave any scent on you."
2496,no problems_Item description was accurate.  Item arrived packaged well and appeared new and in original packaging.  Arrival was  timely.  Lowest price for this item on the net.
2569,Fun_Glad to design my kids nails with these great brushes.  Brought the fun back to painting my kids nails.  Thank you
7602,"perfect_These were exactly what I was expecting, especially for this price. They are perfect for a novice just starting to collect the tools necessary to do their own nails."
4098,"Not to durable_This product has a nice color, but, seriously, it doesn't stay on very long at all i have to retouch it every 6 minutes it's annoying."
8604,"Another good product from Lysol_This hand soap seems to do a good job cleaning the hands.  Unlike other antibacterial hand soaps, this one does not seem to leave a harsh dried-out feeling. After use, my hands felt soft and smooth.  I was not impressed with the smell, but maybe they will come out with other fragrances later.  No complaints about this product.  It does the job."
4085,Great Product_I bought this before in a small kit from Target but I found it for less here on Amazon. I like this hair mask it leaves my hair soft and silky without taking any color out. This is a great product
6285,Like this product_I feel like these little discs sure get my face clean. Easy to use and smell fairly pleasant. Will buy again.
7639,"Hollow Hearts_These are super cute not too big or too small, each section almost completely full and separated, and the colors are very pretty."
9958,"Nice and smooth_I was pleased when I received the chance to review this product for my blog. I have tried a few products from this company and have been pleased with all of them. This is a facial moisturizer that has a weight and thickness some were between a good hand cream and a good night cream, However it absorbs very well which makes it nice to wear morning and night.That being said however I tried both morning and night and found that if I used this moisturizer at night before going to bed I did not need to moisturize in the morning.If you do choose to use in the morning before putting on your make up I would suggest giving about 15-20 min to make sure that the moisturizer has fully absorbed into skin before putting makeup on over it. This will help insure that there is no issues with the makeup clumping or becoming oily do to the absorption of any excess moisturizer."
1318,"smells good_This is my first time trying this product. I have course, thick colored(although grey underneath) which can get rather wiry and unruly on top, which was the reason I ordered this  product. I used it for the first time this morning and I like it so far. It smoothed the wiry hair up on top and overall and it smelled good too. If you have fine hair this may not be your product as you may find it too heavy."
8000,works great!_bonnet is a bit large but works great. I have only used it once but get hot enough w/o burning my ears. great product so far.
6091,"Perfect for holidays!_Any special day can be brightened up with this glitter.  It can be added to any kind of makeup, or even nail polish or skin cream.  It is just a small amount if glitter for each shade, but only a little us required for each wearing.  It is just fun!"
8378,"Perfect_I love the product. I didn't have them express shipped, so it took a while for them to arrive. I've used one so far, and it works just the way it should. I would buy again, but may be more next time."
3366,"Look past the name_While I was hesitant to try any soap with the name &#34;Dudu&#34;, I wanted to try something that was free of chemicals and more natural. The soap works great and I immediately noticed a difference in my skin. Granted, it doesn't look great sitting on the shelf of my shower but I certainly would recommend it for anyone who wants to try a natural product."
72,Good for oily skin._Cheaper than pressed powder for oily skin.  I like it and will buy it again when i have to buy it.
3603,Burt's bees_Not actually three .6 oz lemon butters. Actually 6 .3 oz cuticle butters. Still the same amount if product. Just expecting the larger containers which is why I only have it four stars.
8194,I love this!_I use every single color in this palette!  It works great and the color stays on for a long time even without primer!
1281,"Couldn't Ask For More!_As someone who has fine, but a lot of it, hair.. it tangles EASILY. My hair stylist has noticed a huge difference in hair breakage from when I started using this brush. My ends are less split, my hair is shiny, and over all healthier. I recommend this brush to EVERYONE!"
5684,"Nice exfoliation_I have to admit that I was a little skeptical of this product at first glance.  You put a cotton pad, containing a cleansing foam that's activated by water, onto the spinning head which rotates at either a slow or fast speed.  I found the slow speed didn't seem to do much exfoliating, so I preferred the faster speed.  After the first use my skin was noticeably smoother and fresher than after washing with my regular cleanser.  This definitely seems to provide a deep clean.The only drawbacks were that it doesn't, of course, clean or remove makeup from the eye area, so you'll need to take care of that separately.  Not a big deal, but it might bother some who like to get all their cleaning/ makeup removal done at once.  The other concern is that water gets into the area between the rotating head and the rest of the gadget-- again, not a big deal, but it does need to be laid out to dry.Overall I really liked this product.  It cleaned deeply but was gentle and never irritated my skin, even at the high setting.  It was fun to use and felt like getting a facial massage."
934,Nutranail Bullet_Like putting on another coat of nail polish.  does not really strengthen the nails.  Would not buy this product again.  Sorry.
8308,"Feels as good as the expensive stuff_I've been trying a lot of different hair products lately - my hair feels SO dry in the winter!  I've used moroccan oil for several years now and find it to be the best thing for my strawberry-blonde very curly hair.  I've seen other 'moroccan oil' hair products (conditioners, shampoos, etc) but they always seemed too expensive for the amount of product.I like Suave products, I find them to be very basic and simple and inexpensive.  That said, I can't use the cheaper Suave shampoo/conditioner on my hair, it strips the color and seems to build up too much.  Everyone else in my family uses it with no problems though, and has has for years.When I saw that Suave recently started making moroccan oil type products, I was intrigued.  So I decided to give theSuave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Deep Conditioning Shine Mask, 8 Ouncea try.  I was actually amazed at how nice it made my hair feel! I washed my hair with my regular shampoo then squeezed out the remaining water and coated my hair with the mask.  I let it sit for about 5 minutes and then rinsed.  My hair is noticeably shinier and feels healthy and has a great clean, fresh scent. And the price cannot be beat, it's a great bargain.I like it so much, in fact, that I have the rest of the line (Suave Professionals Moroccan conditioner & shampoo) on my shopping list and would definitely recommend it to others."
4036,"It really, really works! 5 stars well deserved_I was cautious first, thinking this might be another product that promises a lot but does nothing. After 4 weeks of (very irregular) use and applying a very thin layer I could already see a difference. First my lashes got darker (I have light hair), then they started growing and getting stronger. I had very nice lashes originally but over the past 3 - 4 years I neglected using Mascara and other eye products. So my lashes turned brittle, stiff, visibly shorter and were hard to curl. The obvious difference encouraged me to apply a slightly thicker layer and to also treat the lower lashes. I am far away from the recommended 16 weeks to see the best result but already very, very happy. If they grow even longer, I will be thrilled! I wear contacts and have blue eyes. The product did not interfere with the lenses, nor is there any discoloration of the retina or upper/lower eye lid. I do apply during the day though, it's more convenient for me. Even if your lashes are still o.k., just buy this product! It will nourish them and you will love it!"
1617,"Worked well in the beginning..._I used this shampoo right after using the EverSleek Loreal shampoo/conditioner. It was causing build up and made my scalp itchy/flaky and my hair heavy/greasy after a few months of using it.  As soon as I used this Neutrogena shampoo, my hair was clean, itchy/flaky scalp gone. After a couple of months, however, the same thing started to happen with this shampoo/conditioner."
4230,Great shape options_best stencil for eye brows i've found! Just still havent figured out how to keep them on while i try to stencil them on
8922,"Nope, pass on this._Horrible. Much too large, couldn't get it to be tight on my head. Also the color was not white, it was a yellowish gold color. I was expecting a white lace one. Would not order again.."
5634,"EZ Flow 508 nail brush_I received it in no time,it works great and I'm an amature at this. I just used it for a fill and it works better than my other brushes,the price was good I think I best get another one."
823,Very happy._I got this for my son for part of his Christmas present and he was very happy with it.  I will be getting more in the future.
4858,"Exactly what I was looking for_This color was not toourple or light as I was worried it would be. Looks black , which was what I was going for. Only needed 2 coats. Cured in 2 minutes. I top it off with IBD clear builder gel, stronger than any other gel top coats I've tried."
7049,"Did not work_This did not work.  It taste like water.  I have used arnica pills before, and they are great to help with bruises that ache and hurt.This did not seem to do anything at all for me.  The sprayer works good, and it's no problem at all to spray and use. It doesn't taste like anything but water.  I could not tell I had any improvement though.  I used it over a month's period, and never got a thing out of it."
198,Scalpicin_This stuff is like magic in a bottle.  It is wonderful for a itchy scalp and works fast.  I just wish it wasn't so expensive!
5428,"Dont Waste Your Money_This didn't stamp very well, I'm disappointed. The design comes out messy and I tried using different kinds of nail polish too....still stinks. It's sitting on my table collecting dust..."
9302,I tried it and I like that it cleansed my hair_I tried it and I like that it cleansed my hair.  I do not know yet if I am experiencing any hair growth however I am going to continue using it.  It suds up very well and gives your hair a wonderful clean feeling.  I do notice my hair is stronger so I do feel it has helped in that area.
2645,Convenient_I had been looking for a mirror that could magnify 15x or more and be able to fit nicely in my travel bag. This mirror came in handy. Perfect for what I need to see.
828,"My youngest son loves this!_This is a classic!  My younger son loves this cologne, and I did not want to spend a whole lot.  I found this one for a decent price, and it has been worth it."
7995,"color close_I love the browns but this one was really not the same, but I like the brown I got so no complaints. I wish china glaze was more to the colors posted. Guess I will return to OPI sorry"
8712,"A gorgeous, vibrant, textured pink!_I have also bought &#34;Stay the Night,&#34; and I was expecting a duller, matte base coat, with vibrant glitter sparkles. Not so with &#34;The Impossible!&#34; The pink base is so vibrant that it literally glows! The glitter, sand, and star chunks really pop and sparkle! I used two coats, and had a slightly visible nail line, but not enough that I felt it warranted another coat. I don't use base or topcoat as the package directs, and I still have a manicure that lasts well over a week without chips or dings.It does take a bit longer to dry due to the texture, so keep that in mind, but it makes for such a beautiful and unique manicure! I did have to dig a little for the stars, but I'd recommend holding the bottle upside-down for a few minutes to allow the stars to migrate towards the top of the bottle - they seem to all settle in the bottom otherwise."
8156,"Epic Fail_I wasnt to thrilled with this particular flat iron. Even though it's a wet to straight flat iron,I noticed that it actually worked better on dry hair rather than wet. I used it both ways and when wet or damp I had to go over a section of my hair more than once just to get it straight. And even though it turned out better when I used it on dry hair it still left my hair looking and feeling dry and lifeless.The plates are very smooth making it hard to actually grip your hair to smooth through,and at times my hair wouldnt stay in the flatiron at all. I'm sorry,but I doubt if I will ever use this again."
3512,"Can't find anything better_I've used this face wash for many years and nothing beats this product.  My pores clog easily (although I don't have problems with lots of breakouts, thank goodness) so there's a good ratio of beads and soap to exfoliate my skin.  Unless it's a cold, cold winter, I never have problems with skin drying out.  Many other products I have tried have either dried out my skin or doesn't clean the face sufficiently, causing for my face to be sticky and oily, leading to a pimple here or there.  It is good enough to be used daily and really does help the pores around my nose have less blackheads!"
7570,Good night repair cream_I have used this moisturizer now for a few weeks. I think it's doing something but it hasn't lightened my sun spots as well as I was hoping it would. It tingles just a little at first but didn't make my skin break out or anything. Your skin gets used to it after a couple of uses. I will continue to use it in hopes it's improving my skin texture.
3849,Beautiful!_Beautiful vivid colour. Very easy to transfer colour from pan to face. Pan colour is true to colour you will see on your skin. Brings nice flush to face. No allergic reactions. Nyx has great colour selection. I will be buying more.
4583,Frequenst purchaser_I have bought this brand faithfully for almost a year now. I am never disappointed with the quality of this serum and use it prior to my moisturizer. It's a staple for my beauty routine.
5899,"Nice full brush; color still drops a bit at work_I work in a hospital and it can get warm or humid at times when busy. The color will smudge at mid shift under the eyes and it isn't perfectly waterproof. I do like the full brush and the case which is easier to hold than some of the tapered mascara cases.The product came promptly with other Amazon purchases. The price was like drugstore price 7-8 dollar range. I'm still wearing it (it does a nice job with defining lashes). But i wish it was more lasting (hence the 1 star dropped). If they improve the formula, 5 stars then."
6605,"I do love it!!_I have used these countless times for adding different sixed dots to my designs.  A few of them look the same size, but there is still plenty of variety. A definite value for the price.  I know they say that you can make dotting tools out of common household items but sometimes, you just want the proper tools for the job."
6574,small stones but good buy_i like my purchase the stones just seem smaller than average for nail designs but i'm overall happy with it
8752,"sheer_***Copied from my review of another color! I noticed no difference in the feel of my color choices so my review will be the same for all 3, there aren't many reviews for this product on amazon right now so I will leave one on each that I tried because it is a good product and I wish there had been more reviews on here while I stood at the display for about half an hour staring and debating if I should try them!***Also, it does leave a bit of a stain once the glossiness wears off so if you are dark lipped like me you will still be covered I just like the feel of the gloss so I reappy as needed which is maybe 3 hours without eating/drinking!***The packaging really drew me in, guess I like shiny and cute. I bought 3 of these all together and so far none from Amazon. Pick the right stores for a good price but what I paid was a little more than 4$ up to 7$ with a bogo type sale. I have this in 30 Pin Up Peach, 60 Petal Rebel, and 50 Cherry On Top. I love the way they feel on my lips and the color is buildable so you can get different looks from the same stick. I wish they lasted a bit longer but it does stay on a decent amount of time for this type of product. Its lighter than the revlon lip butters with about the same coverage depending on the color. I love all3 though I would say I like 60 the best. When buying more than one you have to be careful, although the tubes are representative of the color within, they look really similar in a rush. These tubes are just too cute! Try one in a color you dont normally wear but want to try"
6728,Like this stuff_Smooth application and it doesn't sting.  I use it with my other Roc products sometimes day and night.  Won't flake under make up either.  Definitely helps reduce dark circles and wrinkles.
1558,"redken color extend_I have coarse porous hair and this takes the color out!!!! In fact if I make a mistake and the color goes too dark this is my go to shampoo for fading it fast! It does a good job of conditioning and your hair does shine, but it is also designed to keep color in which it does not for coarse hair.  This should stipulate on the label that this is not intended for coarse hair!"
6193,"funny girl_Now no one likes the smell but it does what meant to do.I use It for my hair for a deep condition treatment and I mean it grows the hair fast and thick.I use it for the hair because its natural so I use natural things on it.I use it for my body also along with other natural oils.need does smell bad I know, but it is a five star oil.lol"
1146,"Fun and easy to use_I love using these strips! They are a lot of fun to use and they really do leave my skin feeling clean and fresh. I love the new cut lines in the nose strip to help with contouring and find that this strip fits much better than the older original strip. Using these once a week my nose looks clean, fresh and spot free. I think they are worth every penny!"
9716,"Nice body wash_Smells very nice, good suds, and very clean.  Rinsing nicely, too.  I have dry skin, especially in the winter months, and this is not drying at all.  I am usually pleased with Caress products, and this one does not disappoint."
2962,"Luxuriant foam_When I opened the upside-down bottle (made that way so that the contents can be emptied to the last drop), out came a thick foam, the first ball of which was sufficient to lather up almost my whole body. There is a moderately light, coconut-ty scent, which is fine by me. This product is luxurious and all-business at the same time. There is a good balance between soap and moisturizer so that it cleans well without drying."
3263,"sparkly white silver_It's a very pretty color. It's not silver like pots & pans, but it's more glittery white.Useful if you want to make any silvers or glittery whites pop out. or even if you want to do a white/glittery lid type thing.Need a primer esp if you get oily lids."
2840,"REEKS and leaves your hair dry and lifeless!_First of all, I am a big Burts Bees Fan.  This product however, SUCKS.  It smells HORRIBLE-like rotting fruit and it doesn't not condition at all.  My hair felt stripped when putting it on in the shower-and it was dry and almost CRUNCHY dry (thank the lord I did not blowdry).Try the Burts Bees avocado butter if you want a natural hair moisturizing product.  This product is terrible...."
9941,"Loved this Scent!_This is a very creamy conditioner that smells like heaven to me. This is one of the more fragrant but yet mild scents that I have run across in quite awhile. I could just sit here and take in the scent from the bottle for a long time, it kind of reminds me of summer and the beach and the ocean all rolled up into one.This conditioner will leave your hair healthy and shiny and a lot more manageable than it was before. I love that it has natural wildflowers in the mix along with aloe vera and several essential oils and dead sea minerals to make this the perfect conditioner to bring out the best in my hair.After shampooing, apply to wet hair, spreading evenly into scalp. Leave for 1 minute and rinse thoroughly. I like to make sure that it gets all through my hair, so I suggest combing it through your hair to get it spread out and evenly distributed. You are going to love the way your hair responds and smells afterwards.Oh, another side benefit from this conditioner is it helps with your dry scalp, which I definitely need but I don't have dandruff, but if you do or someone in your family does, then this conditioner would be perfect for them to use.  It can be used by both men and women and on all hair types.You will love how soft and silky your hair will feel after using this conditioner. I am just so excited about the wonderful scent myself! You can sort of smell the wildflowers, especially the chamomile extract. I have been trying to figure out which scent stands out the most for me and then  realized, it was the flowers combined with the dead sea salts that make this such a unique blend and scent."
2726,Bought because of great reviews but didn't work for me_I saw no magic on this one.  I wanted it to work because of all the hype of this product but it did not do much.  Yes it feels like a nice primer but there were bits of sparklyness which I didn't get.  I now use the body shop's vitamin c booster which I feel is magic.  Price is much higher but I feel it was worth it.  This product just didn't do it for me.  Price is good so you might as well give a try!
996,"Not an entirely 'Natural' acne treatment system._This product was given to my 15yr. old niece due to her moderate acne problems (inherited from my older brother).  She gave me feedbacks after using 'Natural Results Acne Treatment System' for 5 weeks.'There are three bottles inside the box:  One 4oz. Salicylic Acid Cleanser, one 4oz. Calming Toner with Oligopeptide-10, and one 2oz. Salicylic Acid Lotion.'  My niece has been using natural soaps and benozoyl peroxide based products in conjunction with a dermatologist prescribed tetracycline regimen which has been effective but she was interested in trying out a 'natural acne treatment' product.Even though labeled as 'Natural Results', this product also contains a long list of not so natural ingredients such as dimethicone, potassium sorbate, disodium EDTA, butylene glycol, etc.  The product was found to  be 'a gentle cleanser not as harsh as other cleansers with higher alcohol contents'. The toner and lotion helped to 'decrease the amount of drying'  However, overall, the product did not seem to 'work as fast' as the benzol peroxide based products.Overall, different individuals with varying degrees of acne problems usually find the best types of OTC treatments that work best for them either through recommendations or trial-and-error.  Any severe acne cases should always consult a board-certified dermatologist."
4171,Jergens forever_My  mom used Jergens when I was a child and now I do -  works great - love it as always.
7032,"So far absolutely LOVE!_Ok, I have tried MANY different lines...some I have gotten decent results from but not good enough that I have not continued to look.  Most lines are just iffy.I am 48 years old, grew up in FL and have some pretty significant lines/sun damage.  I have only been using this for about a 1 1/2 weeks but have felt I have liked the results so much so far that I wanted to write a review.  I will review again after some additional usage.I have oily skin which I blot nemerous times a day for the shine.  I have found since using this line that my skin seems much more balanced...I do not have nearly the shine (grease) which I normally do.Additionally, I have seen a significant improvement in my crowsfeet.  They have seriously diminished!!!!I just love the eye cream!!!.The cleanser is very nice and the serum is heavenly scented and absorbs into the skin beautifully.I cannot wait to see how things progress and will review later...but so far GRADE A results!"
6722,Beware._I REALLY LOVE THEIR GLITTER POLISHES BUT THE BASE COLOR OF THIS WAS MORE YELLOW THAN DEPICTED IN THE PICTURE.
2489,"MATTE NAIL POLISH_very good product for those who dont want the shiny look all the time, for their nails."
3111,"Efficient_I like this Finish because it is really good for when you are travelling, The two on one is great."
6014,"Great micro dermabrasion system._This little system is compact and pretty lightweight, much smaller than expected. The 3 tips are useful. It comes with a how-to video which makes it easy to use and understand. The tip uses filters to 'catch' the dead skin but not much gets caught in the filter unlike  other dermabrasion machines i have used. I cant really comment on the durability yet since it has been only a few weeks.After use, my skin feels so soft! My teenage daughter uses it too on her oily skin and she loves the smoothness after use. Her skin is soooo soft , too."
5762,Great Brushes!!!_I love these brushes!!! I discovered these brushes friom one of the youtube videos and I had to try!!!! I was not disappointed!!!
5006,"Looooove_I have never been a Paul Mitchell fan, but I LOVE this shampoo! It smells amazing, and you don't have to use a lot of it to get a great lather. I have very fine hair, and it gives me hair plenty of moisture without weighing it down. I'm hooked!"
3141,"Quite impressed!_I bought this conditioner on clearance and have had it in my 'stock' pantry .. I just got done bleaching and toning my hair, I went through my stock looking for something that was sulfate free and grabbed this one figuring I need moisture. I left the conditioner on for about two hours, just rinsed it out and blow dried my hair and wow! I cannot believe how soft my hair feels for just bleaching it. I'm a professional, expensive product junkie, but I would most definitely recommend this product! By the way, I have 3c hair and I can't stop running my fingers through it."
4991,"pretty darn nice_Can only recommend these. I use them with duo glue and find them easy to apply and remove. They give a dramatic look and for some, cutting the length may be a good choice- definitely a great buy."
1628,"Pretty Color_I love this color it's going to look great on my nails..cant wait to try it on, Thank you for quick delivery"
7644,love it but dont use it much_havent purchased a good glue that would hold them in position. i received every single color. but next time ill aim a bit smaller. this style is too bulky for me.
8455,softens My Hair and smells good_This is a great conditioner. It has helped to tame my fly aways and heal my damaged hair. Also it smells di inert. I cat h the fresh scent randomly throughout the day after I use it.
7950,Very Pretty!!!_These are so pretty! They are so tiny and delicate and look very expensive on the nail. However they do slip and get mixed up in the wheel because of how thin they are. They came rather quickly and were packaged good. I did have to sort them but was not a big deal.I am very satisfied with my order.
4553,"DEFINITELY NOT FAKE!!!_I LOVE THIS HAIR MASQUE!!! IT SMELLS WONDERFUL & MOISTURIZES MY HAIR VERY NICELY!!! THIS ITEM IS NOT FAKE, I RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL THE MACADAMIA NATURAL OIL LOVERS!!!"
3401,"Even the Avon lady LOVED this !_My wife has been selling Avon for 25 years , and her loyalty to that line usually provides resistence in trying other brands. This one however she found very appealing. Whereas many lotions (according to my wife) can make you feel greasy or oily , the Vaseline Sheer Infusion went on smoothly and when applied in the right amount provided a relaxing , warm feeling. I liked the aroma of it , and the fact that it stayed on her and did not rub off onto me !"
896,"Great moisturizer!_This serum is fantastic!  Made my skin look and fee amazing!  My skin actually glowed!  I love the way my skin feels after putting on this serum. There was no oily shine, but my skin looked moist and refershed, brighter somehow.  I would highly recommmend this serum."
9692,Works great_This works great for my daughters long hair that is so hard to care for. I like the scent too. Way to go Dove.
6678,"Good Product_I'm a beach person and the hot sunny weather we've had lately gave me the perfect opportunity to try this product. The fragrance was the first thing I noticed, a very pleasant coconut scent and it went on like a nice moisturizer. It wasn't greasy and it protected my skin. I received this product from Amazon Vine but I would definitely buy it."
4899,"ok_Havent seen much of a change but the eye area is well hydrated and it doesn't burn my eyes,and that is a definite plus."
1064,"Crisp Clean Feeling and Great Smelling Hair_This is really the ONLY shampoo I use.  When I had long hair I would use it because it rinsed out easily, prevented dandruff, kept it looking and feeling nice, smelled amazing, and didn't torture the hair.  Now, with short hair, I still use it because no other product seems to perform as well without being double the cost.  Nothing better than that clean feeling just out of the shower, and this shampoo provides just that for hours after getting out.The massive pump bottle is convenient and seems to last forever.  Awesome for those days that you need to knock out an 8 minute shower..."
739,"LOVE LOVE LOVE!_This is like a detox for your face. The luxury reminds me of something you'd get in a hotel's spa while on vacation. I love it. Not only does your skin feel better, the enzymatic debridement makes it feel better too."
6408,"Great brush!_I bought this for highlighting powder and I am so happy with it's performance. Picks and holds powder well and with the tapered end you can get into smaller, direct areas, as well as wider areas of your face. Perfect for what I wanted, no loose brush hairs and I use it daily. I'm very happy with this!"
4442,"Conair Infiniti You Curl Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron, XL_I love this wand! It heats it hot enough to curl my thick hair and the curls last throughout the day. I recommend this product."
8527,"Smells great, light, moisturizing_I have always liked Nexxus products, and this line is right on par with their other products. It is a moisturizing, yet lightweight shampoo. It leaves my thick, yet fine color treated hair feeling soft. After a couple of weeks, I can say that my hair feels nice and maybe even a touch more shiny than before. It smells soft and neutral with a slight sweet candyish smell. I think it is a great shampoo at an affordable price. I will use it when I alternate between my usual brand to keep my hair happy."
3304,"Great Product_I love the Palmer's skin lotion products.  I like that this is in a jar and much easier to get out to apply to my body.  I have the same product in a squeeze bottle but sometimes it is hard to get out because of the thickness of the lotion.  Yes, I will purchase this again."
8888,Dark brown_I ordered this wig around mid July. It said it would arrive around the beginning of September. It arrived the first of August!!! Love that! This wig is a very pretty color. A rich dark chocolate brown so pretty. I love the way it feels and it is not too shiny. I will say though that is is pretty thin. I may need to buy hair extensions this color and add them to the wig. Other then that it is a great day to day wig.
4051,"love this color_This is probably my 15th lipgloss in the same color, cannot get enough of this one, unfortunately its not available anymore in pharmacies but luckily got it on amazon. i should probably stock up before it disappears."
1589,"Upstanding Pick_My hair is fine and straight.  When it gets wet, is all sticks together like overcooked spaghetti.  Detangling combs don't work well, and I prefer the pick because the handle faces the same direction as the teeth.This pick has long plastic teeth which are rectangular in shape, wider near the handle and tapering toward the end.  They do not come to a point.The pick does not scratch the scalp, does not catch hair, doesn't get static, and so far, hasn't picked up much hair product.  When you are not using it, store it in a drawer or on end.  It balances perfectly.It's smooth, sturdy, and works easily through hair."
4554,"I have African American/Dominican relaxed hair_And I only use this once a week (because i usually only wash my hair once a week) and it helps with keeping my hair smooth, but make sure you leave it in for the right amount of time (7 min) or I'm pretty sure it won't work. I usually just put it in at the end of my shower, get out of the shower and get dressed then go to the kitchen sink and rinse it out. If you leave it in to long it starts to tingle, or at least my scalp did. It doesn'r really do much for my kinky roots between relaxers. The size is pretty good fpor the price, considering you're only supposed to deep condition once a week It will last you a good two months depending on hair length (mine is  just above shoulder). And a little goes a long way, so don't think you have to glob on a handful ! Just put a little and comb it through!"
1997,"Reversing those reckless years_This contains a silky blend of antioxidants, plant oils, etc., and does repair sun damage and minor discolorations, albeit slowly, perhaps due to the lower concentration of niacinamide.  As someone who spent most of her life in the tropics, and in the early years basking in the sun drenched in only baby oil, I now have the sun spots to prove it. (Thanks to genetics not the wrinkled skin, but I digress.  The sun spots on my hands, arms and chest have gone from a medium cocoa to light caramel and with prolonged use of this product at night, along with sunscreen during the day, I anticipate continued results.One additional note, I'm a big fan of Nia24 Skin Strengthening Complex and since this cream delivers niacinamide, yet in a larger package (almost 3x the size) and at a lower price, I thought I'd try this for my face.  Since this only contains half of the concentration and the ingredients are slightly different, it doesn't deliver the same results as the complex and also caused minor break outs.  Use this cream for its intended purpose and spring for the complex for your face."
3704,"PRETTY BUT COLLAPSES_This item is very pretty and feminine and the perfect size to hold the cosmetic items I have.  Unfortunately, if you don't pack it well, the walls collapse, especially if you zip open the top.  Even with that imperfection, I am quite happy with this purchase.  The price was right, it's pretty and fairly functional."
2002,"love this for travel_I love using these, when my makeup wont come off in the shower or if I'm in a hurry.. or just traveling these are my favorite. Plus they dont count as a liquid container during travel!"
845,"Sweet kisses of sugar....._Yeah, it's kissable on your neck...compliments of my boyfriend....ha-ha-ha!!!He's sold!!Me tooooo!!!I think this perfume smells delicious!!!The scent lingers once you spray, last long on the skin. Smells like to me: a bit of burnt sugar--in a good way, like caramel, a hint of cotton candy and some raspberry scent tones in it. This is the reason why I wanted to try it out so I bought it and I am happy I did.:)"
6635,"Works as good as the one I tried at the mall._Definitely smooths my hair better than any other straightener I've tried.  One pass at a slightly slower speed, and my hair is silky and straight--and that says a lot as I have really thick, very frizzy, moderate to strong curly hair. I even like how it curls as well. Now, instead of 25 minutes, I can straighten in about 7-10 minutes and my arm isn't nearly as tired. It also stays straight and doesn't seem to re-frizz the next day, so I can go a few days and it still looks great. Very happy so far after a few weeks."
2783,"Revitalift cleanser!!!_When it arrived, the tube had leaked and the package was all messy.  The little left into the tube went on leaking and I could not really used it.  Don't know if the product is good or not, but the conditioning is deplorable!"
6789,Quality product_Just about anything Australian Gold is going to be top notch and this goes right along with the rest of their lotions. I use this regularly and very happy with the results.
4089,"No Noticeable Shine After Weeks of Use_My hair is lately dull and dry thanks to over-processing, so when I saw the Fekkai Glossing Starter Kit, I thought I found the answer to shiny, healthy looking hair. Instead of giving my hair a healthy glow, I ended up with frizzier hair. I used all three products exactly as directed over a period of 2 weeks - which is about as long as the product lasted. Still, I did not see any improvement to my hair as far as a 'shiny, healthy' look.  I did love the citrus (lemon/lime) smell but that was about all I enjoyed about the product."
7022,"Good Stuff--it's a Touche Eclat Copy._It doesn't make my eyes itch, and it works really well. It's like a Touche Eclat knockoff, and it does a pretty impressive job of being a Touche Eclat knockoff.(Touche Eclat is a cult Yves Saint Lauren concealer/highlighter.)It is a highlighter, though, so I wouldn't use it to cover bumps or acne--it's a highlighter."
4930,"LOVE_Seriously, this stuff is amazing. My face is never as clear as it is when I am using this regularly."
2400,"Black Hair Donut (large)_This is exactly what I wanted. It takes me 30 seconds to do my hair now, and I am so pleased. I expected it to take a while to arrive, though it still came a day earlier than it's 4 week expected delivery date. So that was nice. And though I have long honey blond hair, I don't have any issues with the black mesh of the hair donut showing through the bun.This was cheap [$1 and free shipping] and well made. 5/5 stars."
333,"Bristles keep falling out!_This was a total waste of money - I've had it a week and the bristles are falling out all over the place.  I thought maybe it would get better after a few days, but no luck.  I don't know - perhaps this is not the real thing because the first Bare Minerals brush I owned (that I replaced with this one) was fine for almost a year before it started shedding."
3457,"&lt;3_I absolutely love this product!It's amazing, completely does everything it says and more.Definitely worth the money found my life time eye shadow primer"
6322,Not worthy_The wax paper sheets are extremely thin so you end up using 2 or 3 at a time. Because the sheets are so thin they can only absorb so much oil so you blot more often than usual. Not worth your time or money.
3653,"Refreshing_Glad to see so many great reviews of this product.First off, I have sensitive, combination and acne prone skin. I've tried many cleansers over the years and have found they have either been too expensive or too drying for my skin.  For instance, I really like Dermaquest's enzyme cleanser ($30) and Cor's silver soap ($40), but they are rather expensive -- great products though.  I came across The Body Shop's (TBS) tea tree cleanser a few weeks ago and found I have really liked using it for many reasons.In terms of value, I find it is decent, as a little does seem like it goes a long way.  TBS also runs sales and emails me coupons, so I would be able to purchase at a reduced price in the future (though I did purchase this using a 20% off coupon code).  In fact, they recently had a 40% off coupon code for the Memorial Day holiday. Free shipping at their website if you spend over $50 is a nice perk too.  Of course, there is the free shipping deal from Amazon if you spend over $25, so shipping costs are not a problem for me.The face wash itself is a nice consistency and leaves a cool feeling on my face, which is perfect for the hot/humid weather we have been having in my area.  One of the best parts is that my skin does not feel dry at all after using it, which has been great.  There is a slight 'tea tree' scent from it, which doesn't bother me and seems to go away quickly.  I also use this with my Clarasonic (acne head).  The verdict is still out as to whether the Clarisonic itself does anything for my skin (I've had it nearly 3 years), but I have been really liking their new acne head as of late.Overall, the tea tree facial wash is worth trying if you have combination skin, as I have found it hasn't dried me out, yet seems to leave my skin feeling clean and fresh.  If you're not sure about it, there's a mini version of it on TBS's website for $4, which makes for a nice travel size as well.  It also comes in a kit with a full size tea tree oil and mini sizes of their tea tree lotion & toner for $25.UPDATE:  10/11/13I've used this cleanser through the Summer and I have to say that I really have grown to love it.  I failed to mention above that I have sensitive, combination, acne-prone skin, so it's rather a nightmare to find a good cleanser at a good price.  We had a very humid Summer, so my skin was very oily.  That was no problem for this cleanser!  Additionally, my skin never felt irritated after washing, which is very typical with other cleansers.  In fact the only cleanser that my skin did not react to wasCor Silver Soap, 1.05 oz-- it's great, but, wow...expensive (though it's on sale at the moment).  Anyway, I will continue with TBS's cleanser through the Winter to see how my skin responds."
4440,"Potentially dangerous..._My wife and nine year old daughter tried out this curling iron. They were both excited to try it out, and confused and disappointed when they did. The iron get very hot, very quickly, but when my wife used it on her shortish straight hair, it did not work well. She mentioned that she likely is not coordinated enough to use it on herself. Fine, so try it on someone else, right? She tried it with our daughter's longer hair, and it did curl fairly well (though the curl did not last long), however, we would not recommend using this with younger children, because of the burn fear. This product may work well for some (longer hair), but there seems to be a pretty steep learning curve to using this, and you may not want to put the time into it."
8917,"A bubblegum pink that POPS!_This looks amazing in sunlight -- it's not quite a neon but it's definitely bright and noticeable. I love this color because I've been looking for a bright bubblegum pink, and this is perfect! The formula is typical Essie - kinda gloopy and thick - but not too bad."
9270,An excellent addition_Truly a nice fragrance - if a touch on the feminine side - but also a true luxuriance of lather.
797,"Great Color_This dye is easy to use although messy if you are not extremely careful, but does yield great result and color. For what you would pay at the salon or a lot less you can dye your eyelashes and brows 30+ times. I say 30+ even though the package says 40 because I think after it gets so old it doesn't work as well. Which for me was okay, because I got more than my money out of it. I think it get old before you can finish it, because your lashes will last 4-6 weeks. Mine last upwards of 6 weeks and you can see the tips are still black when they grow out, so I just dye them again and they look amazing every time. I would watch you tube videos for helpful tips, because again this can be messy and can burn. In fact the first time I used this I made a mess by getting the step one in my eye and not realizing it till I put step two on and it burned so bad I swore I wouldn't use it again, but as I perfected my technique I don't make that mistake."
4309,"Use It Everywhere_This argan oil absorbs instantly into skin, hair,and cuticles.  The smell is pleasant enough, and the Amazon price is half that charged in my local hair salon for the same product.  Some reviewers mention skin sensitivity and break-outs - my skin is dry and extremely sensitive, and I've had no problems."
1313,"They changed the formula_I used to love this stuff, it used to be white and creamy but the last two bottles were more transparent and dried sticky.  Made my eyes feel gummy and crinkled."
7316,"Thick barrier cream_This is a great cream for nighttime use in the dry winter months.  I did not observe any change in my fine lines and hyperpigmentation, but I didn't have much to begin with.  It should also be noted I only paid ~$25 for this...not over a $100!  If you are looking for a Vitamin A analogue cream, ask your doctor for an Rx of Retin-A, etc instead!"
2964,"It sucks_My skin is dry so I m always looking for nice product for my dry skin. This one, awful. It don't make my skin more moist but smell strange and after I m trying so hard wash it but still something left on my skin. Under the light I can see their shinning. I do not like my skin just looks shining with some material I can't tell. I pay for make my skin health and comfortable soft. I m so glade it didn't damage my skin."
8719,cheap mystery metal_i'm not sure what these are made of but it's sure not surgical steel. Or stainless steel. Or Steel. Doesn't seem sanitary.They seem super light and cheap .. more like toy jewelry material.
8933,"awesome product_this product is awesome would recommend it to any and every one, this applies foundation etc perfectly. good buy. and I received products before its expected time"
2734,"very good procudt_This product is very good.  It goes on smooth, and last. I put two thin layers on not one thick one.  I have been wearing since I recieved almost 1 week and no chips, peeling ect.  It is a little pricy but seems to wear a long time. It is a quality nail polish.  They did send me a free sample of nail bubbles for cleaning nails with purchase which was nice.Note: Do no expect your nail tips to be bright white like it would be if you have an actual French Manicure.  I have used similar product before and knew what to expect so I was completly satisfied."
9942,Awesome!_Smells SOOOOO GREAT! It makes your hair soft and shiny and easy to manage! LOVE this!
504,"BETTER THAN CHI_THIS HEATS UP FAST, LEAVES HAIR SOFT, AND IT AN AWESOME STRAIGHTENER. IT IS GREAT FOR THE PRICE. ALSO MORE AFFORDABLE THAN OTHER BRANDS!"
1128,"Great color for brown eyes_I love this color. It is brown with subtle hints of purple. Really brings out my eyes but in a very natural way. I like that it twists up so I can keep it in my purse or makeup bag and not worry about needing a sharpener (which results in a bunch of waste anyway when you sharpen away a portion of the pencil). Just be sure not to twist it up too high or it will break.Not so sure about the colorstay aspect of it - doesn't seem to last much longer than other eyeliners I use, but this is just a casual observation."
7758,"work great_These work great. They don't get tangled in my hair unless I try and grab too much hair. I won't get to use them for a while (cut my hair shorter recently) but I tried them out earlier this year and really liked the results.if you need help, look on you tube for videos. Tons available."
5586,"Ouch!_I'm not sure this thing works but I'm sure it is a bit painful. I'm also not surprised that Angelina Jolie is one of the folks who endorses it....she looks like she's might be into a little pain from time to time, I'm not. If you don't mind feeling like you've gotten a wind burn, you might like to use this small instrument of torture and maybe it will exfoliate or something but I've found no evidence of anything beneficial in my case."
4466,Love_Dr. Teal's scented epsom salt is amazing.  It smells so good and it's the perfect thing after a long day.
4198,Good bath scrubber_Its not super pretty or fancy......It gets the job done....Its easy to use and I find it a very good cleansing device...I would recommend
5094,Great Shampoo_I have been using Tresemme for many years and have always had great results. This is an inexpensive way too having great looking hair. (Oh La Lah)
4914,"Seeing the difference after 3 days of use_I ordered this product based on recommendations of friends and I'm glad I tried it.  I have been on the Obagi regimen since my late college years.  Now I'm 30 and wanted to try something else or incorporate a new product to my regimen.  I use Cerave moisturizing wash, Obagi toner and Obagi tretinoin cream .1 in the evening and a glycol moisturizer in the morning with sunscreen and it has worked to make my skin supple and glowing.  In using Obagi for several years, I noticed that you can't use it consistently.  My dermatologist recommended that I take breaks or add another product that will shock my skin as if going on a &#34;restart&#34; before I get back into the regular Obagi regimen.  My skin is recently getting dryer and moisturizers don't seem to work in getting it back to its usual glow.  I remembered how nice my skin looked after a peel, back when I used to get them.  But peels are expensive and I did not appreciate the down time of having your whole face come off on you before it gets better.  I did this when I was reviewing for the bar and I could hide out indoors for weeks at a time but I can't really do that now.  Hearing good things about the AB peel, I read a few more reviews and then decided on the Extra strength version.  I did not know what the difference was having no experience whatsoever between these products.  I figured I wanted something that will deliver the best results in the shortest time possible so I went for the Extra strength and I do not regret this decision.The item arrived a day earlier than promised and it was packaged well with bubble wrap around the cylindrical carton tube that held the two containers.  On my first day of use, I used it on the evening replacing my toner (which has alcohol as an ingredient) with the Dr. Gross AB peel.  Observing that a whole pad was soaked in the product I opted to half it.  Half the pad was more than enough to cleanse and tone my face.  If you intend to use this on your neck, then you might need the whole pad but for my purposes it was sufficient.  My initial observations with the pads marked as 1 was that it smelled pleasantly clean and neutral.  There were no overpowering smells of additives or perfumes in the pads and putting it on my skin was easy and pleasant.  I did not experience any discomfort or stinging on my skin and the product dried quickly.  As stated in the instructions, I waited over 2 minutes to have it absorb fully into my skin.  After waiting I put on pad number 2 and did the same thing I did when I applied the first pad.  After waiting 2 minutes, I applied my regular Obagi Tretinoin and went to bed.When I woke up, I immediately noticed a more radiant glow.  My pores were smaller and my skin was more supple.  Repeating this process again in the morning, I put on my glycolic moisturizer after and topped it off with sunscreen.  I have repeated this process for the past 3 days and I noticed that the dried skin from my chin and sides of my cheeks have disappeared.  No more flake dryness anywhere just a radiant glowing skin.I am sold on this product.  It is a great addition to my Obagi regimen and it is amazing at exfoliating my skin to reveal that hidden pinkish glow.  I no longer complain about dryness and my pores are nearly invisible now that I've switched to the peels.  I recommend this product to anyone that wants to improve their tone and exfoliate their face from dry and old skin.  The only negative thing I can think about this product is price.  It is not chump change buying this peel but the good thing is you can always half the pads or opt to use it less often than daily (perhaps 3 times a week) once you've achieved your desired results.  It is expensive but worth every penny you spend for it."
6798,"Perfect color_If you are looking for a true sea foam color, this is it. It's so pretty. The Gelish polish is awesome."
7305,"Works Well_To be fair, I do not have dandruff, but mild psoriasis. As an adult, I have used dandruff shampoos to treat it. Some worked and some did not. This works fairly well, so much so that I can wear black outfits, and see very few flakes and infrequently. For a dandruff shampoo, it is mild and has a pleasant smell, an issue with the best shampoos out there like tar based ones.  Because it is so mild, it can be used every day or every other day which is not the case with tar based shampoos. It also rinses out very quickly and leaves the hair squeaky clean. The shampoo also gives volume to my fine curly short hair, an added benefit that I am struggling to find with other shampoos that protect hair which is color treated.I like this shampoo and am willing to try the one for color treated hair next."
8577,"DO NOT USE_It burns, It doesn't dry right, it doesn't soak off...overall awful experience using. I suggest sensationail brand LED gel. It doesn't burn, and its much easier to get off...and it probably has safer ingredients."
6260,"Awesome polish for an amazing price_Though my first shipment was lost and it had to be reshipped, I still received my product before I needed it. They arrived individually wrapped and none were broken. The colors are vibrant and most go on with a single coat!! There are a lot of glitters in this set. For those that don't want the glitters this may not be the set for you because it works out to be about 50/50. I paint nails and do nail art almost daily and I am very pleased and will order again!"
6097,great item_Very nice item!  I used this to style a wig and keep it in shape and it works well.  Will be back for a few more.
3884,"Just be careful if you have thin or blond hair_the first three times I use this product, I was absolutely amazed at how well it added lift in volume to my roots, made my hair appear thicker, and noticeably filled in some male pattern baldness. I did not expect this to work as well, where I expected it to be very much like glue in my hair. Quite the opposite, it was almost unnoticeable and served very well as a light hairspray.  The only thing that I would be careful of is given the fact that I have blonde hair that is thinning (at 40 years old) it did start to build up a little bit of a residue after three straight days of use even with washing it every day. I think part of it was on the third day I may have used a little too much as well. Just make sure you alternate good cleansing shampoos, and if you don't have to use it give your hair a little bit of some natural break from products. But for that one or two nights or days that you want to look your best... you cannot beat this product along with the line of shampoo and conditioners."
1163,"Doesn't completely tame frizz but still an amazing product_I bought the No Poo, DevaCare One condition and the DevaCurl Deva Care Arc Angell. This line of product definitely makes my curls look gorgeous! They're more defined and my husband constantly tells me it looks sexy haha I get compliments from people often! My only gripe is that I believed all frizz would be eliminated but I still have quite a bit of frizz. I use the right type of dryer too (which I don't use every single time). I'm hoping it's because I've only been using this stuff for 2 1/2 weeks and I know it takes up to 6 weeks to see a total transformation. I'm a fan of the shampoo and gel smell but I do not like the smell of the conditioner. It reminds me of my grandma's Dove soap lol  I will continue to purchase these hair products and I'll update my review after 6 weeks! :)"
8199,Great for thick hair_I love these rubber bands because they don't pull your hair out but they stay in tight so even thick hair stays in a ponytail.
9675,possitively radiant_I loved my experience using the Vitamin C serum. I love to find fabulous new Natural & Organic products and this one is one my top list.
1075,"Works!_This is one of the best masks I've used.  My skin looks and feels like I just left the spa.  My skin looks better immediately and my pores, what pores?  Will continue to use."
9044,"It really works!_Everything claimed about this brush has proven to be true. It glides beautifully through my hair, my weave, and my human and synthetic wigs. No tearing, no pulling, really a nice product!"
4431,Can't live without it_I have always struggled with acne and nothing has ever really worked. This ( if used daily the way it says ) is a lifesaver. My acne has diminished. The small pimpled that I may get every once in a while are shallow and barely even considered a pimple. I am lost without this stuff and have gotten the auto ship on Proactiv's website that's how much I love this stuff.
8058,"dries faster_I just figured I would give it a try since the Deva line works so well for me.  Thought the glove shaped microfiber towels( MF towels that I can  buy in giant bags for just $12)  were just a gimmick.  But since I air dry for the best curls, getting more of the water out of the hair with the gloves has cut my air dry time down and that is fantastic.  I did not give 5 stars since I think these are overpriced.  FYI, when I read the instructions, I saw that microfiber towels should not be washed with other items in the washing machine as the lint reduces efficiency of the MF towels. good to know."
268,"Long Lasting, Beautiful Color, Slow to Chip_I am a big fan of OPI nail lacquer.  I was looking for a new red.  This one has the tone I was seeking.  Bright, without being in your face.  It is a lovely, iridescent color.  Long lasting, and slow to chip."
2082,Very Drying shampoo!!_I tried this shampoo today and its not moisturizing at all.My hair became literaly hard and brittle as i was shampooing it.It was worse than a dollar store shampoo.I like the other products in this line but this shampoo is terrible.
8998,"Little lift, Lot of liabilities_I'm always looking to add lift and volume to my fine wavy hair. This powder promises to do so with a fashion forward lived in look. The powder is contained in a small tubular container with a sprinkle top. First problem was getting it out of the container. It clumps and sticks. I banged it on the table which helped a bit. Finally  some came out. It had an odd sticky feel and was unpleasant to the touch. With some trepidation, I applied it to my roots. It add some lift, but not significantly more than any dry shampoo (Some good ones;Oscar Blandi Pronto Dry Shampoo Powder, 2.5 OunceOscar Blandi Pronto Invisible Volumizing Dry Shampoo Spray, 5 Ounce)and not nearly as much as hairspray or a good volummizing mousse likeTIGI Bed Head Superstar Queen for A Day Thickening Spray, 10.2 OunceorBig Sexy Hair Volumizing Hairspray, Spray & Play, 10.0 oz (284 g)orNEXXUS ProMend Bodifying Mousse, 9 OunceAs far as the promised 'lived in matte finish' there is a fine line between matte and dull and dirty. This product definitely crossed the line and unless you aspire to that too many nights stranded out in the wild look you will not be thrilled. Equally objectionable is the sticky feel and multiple washings necessary to remove this from your hair.So while it did provide some lift that lasted, the difficulty in getting it out of the container, the dull, dirty look, sticky feel and effort necessary to wash it out, makes this a no for me."
9471,"Gives Relief to Toddler with Eczema_My daughter has battled with eczema since she was an infant.  We are very limited to the types of soaps, shampoos, and lotions she can use.  In fact, several other brands of eczema lotions and cremes cause her eczema to flair up.  Eucerin Baby Eczema Relief Body Creme actually works for her!I really like this creme, as it goes on thick and lasts for the entire day.  However, it does not clog the skin. It is one of the few products for babies and small children that prevents dry, itchy skin.  It has a very light, pleasant scent, and my daughter's skin looks and feels healthy.Since using the Eucerin Creme, we have used her prescription cream on very few occasions.  I highly recommend this product for babies, children, and adults with eczema.  Even if it seems like you've tried every product and seen little results, give this one a chance--it really works!"
1380,"Denman Large Natural Bristle Cushion Brush is a terrific brush!_This was purchased for my niece, who has tangly hair and was having an awful time using her mother's brush to comb those tangles out in the morning.  Hair brushing has gone from something that had to be endured (often with frowns or even tears) to something that is much more pleasant.  I've even seen her smile while brushing her hair.  This brush has nylon bristles which extend beyond the length of the shorter natural bristles in the brush, and the nylon bristles are rather &#34;scratchy&#34; (the ends haven't been rounded, they're sharp) but my niece with her sensitive head has no complaints."
4513,"the picture is different of what you get....._My daughter ordered based on the picture - the colors of pink , blue and gold shown, it is not what comes. At the end, it came purple / dark pink w/ some subtle glitters - totally different from what is shown, so she became disappointed. I am adding more details on the above message. I would like to state that the product gets the color shown in the picture when it gets light on it, I mean artificial light."
8902,"There's no such thing as 'invisible' zinc Dorothy!_I agree with the other reviewers here that I was at first disappointed with the false advertising about &#34;invisible zinc&#34;; however, this brand is superior for me.  It doesn't seem to clog my pores like 100% of other brands, it's unscented and hypoallergenic -- I'm allergic to 95% of the products on the market, and it seems to help in the sun.I've had to wear sunscreen for decades because of hereditary blotching from the sun/light.  I can't say that sunscreen helps that much, but it certainly has protected my skin from the abuse I can put it thru somedays being outside in the sun all day.  I wear it religiously and I will continue to trust this brand over many of the others I've tried."
9164,"Nice, thick, and emollient lotion, but contains a lot of mineral oil_I really like how thick and emollient this lotion is.  When I've used it, it helps soothe my irritated skin right away, and helps calm the redness down.Because it is so thick, however, I have to be careful with where and how I apply it; if my eczema is acting up on my hands, I have to apply this sparingly to the affected areas or else risk having greasy hands for awhile.The ingredients are also designed to build your skin's barrier, and the ceramides are supposedly very effective for that.  Another reviewer commented on the strong scent, but, to me, it really is fragrance-free.  It is also free from steriods and dyes, and doesn't contain parabens.While I really like how well this works, I'm  not sure if I'll continue to use it since one of the main ingredients in it is mineral oil, which I try to avoid since my experience has been that it's a cheap filler that, while it works well to keep moisture in the skin, still doesn't feel as 'breathable' to me as other occlusive agents.Amazon isn't including the ingredient list, but I'm copying it here from the Eucerin website:*  Active Ingredients: Colloidal Oatmeal 1.0%*  Inactive Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Mineral Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Octyldodecanol, Cetyl Palmitate, PEG-40 Stearate, Glycyrrhiza Inflata Root Extract, Ceramide 3, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Piroctone Olamine, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Benzyl Alcohol, Citric Acid."

5652,good stuff_The quality is much better than I expected to get. these are very good interments. i highly recommend them. Great price too.
6313,"My new favorite!!!_I am a huge fan of all Gelish products more so than Gelac or Shellac. I have many shades but this one is my fav! This is a purple glitter polish that can be worn over top any base color or by itself for a translucent purple glitter tint. I personally put this color over black & it looks amazing. It's not too overpowering and bright. Over black you can see the sparkle of the glitter but it looks more like a plum shade which is perfect for anyone who wants to pull off a different look but still keep it classy & simple. Beautiful color, I definitley recommend it!"
2117,Great Soap!_I have tried several of the Out of Africa soaps.  I love them all.  They smell great and are perfect for dry skin.
3759,cool minty feeling_i put this in a squirt bottle with half water and rinse with it twice a day.  It has a minty afterfeeling which i love the tingy sensation
4150,Really Nice Conditoner_This is a really nice conditioner. It is thinner than other conditioners Ive used but it does the job and smells great!
6915,"Great blow dryer for little money_It does all I expected and I have to say, for the money I paid, it's a great deal. You have the option to adjust the heat, which is just fine, so everybody who wants a cheap blow dryer, this is it. Also the cord has a nice length, and the blow dryer is not too loud either. Highly recommended!"
4338,"Best brush for blowdrying!_This brush is awesome.  It has literally cut my blow dry time in HALF.  I purchased a nice, professional hair dryer a year or so ago and that too cut my time in half.  Between the two of them, my hair is dry in less than 10 minutes.My hair is halfway down my back, medium thickness, Caucasian, dark brown, and color-treated, for reference."
155,"great color_I love this color but have a hard time finding it in drugstores. It's a great red color, very rich and holds the color better than other brands. It also is gentle on my hair."
8975,"Absolutely the best nail polish remover!_I was reluctant to spend this much on a remover but after reading reviews and loving Zoya's polishes, I tried it.  It's wonderful.  Leaves nails feeling 'normal' and no dehydrated.  It really takes off polish quickly and effectively and smells better than any other remover I've used.  I would highly recommend it.  However, if you change polish a lot and use a lot of it, it will get expensive - on the whole - to keep buying.  I would buy it again."
8413,"Very smooth primer_I love this primer! Just a tiny dab covers my face and helps me stay matte all day. I'm kind of addicted to the texture; it feels like velvet! It helps BB cream go on smoothly. I appreciate the fact that it makes my pores look smaller, but I LOVE how it keeps my face from getting oily throughout the day. I have combination skin, and my forehead can start to look slick after a few hours without the right products. I feel like this primer is very gentle on my skin.My only word of caution: I suggest not using it on very dry or flaky areas. I have occasionally dry, flaky spots on my cheeks, and I notice that this primer actually exaggerates dryness and makes flakiness really stand out. I'd be sure to exfoliate and moisturize very well before trying it on dry skin.There isn't that much product in the container, as others have pointed out, but you only need a tiny amount each time. I expect this primer to last several months. Love Tonymoly products. I'll definitely purchase again!"
9613,"More cleaning, smaller size._My first reaction to these Cetaphil cloths was: &#34;Okay, these are small baby wipes&#34;.  Not exactly.  These are focused on detailed facial cleaning, so the size is smaller.  The cloth is softer than most baby wipes, and yet durable enough for the tack.  The cleaning &#34;ingredients&#34; (for lack of a better word) are both stronger and very gentle.This is a high-quality product.  In my opinion, they earn a premium price compared to using baby wipes for the same task.  However, whether I would buy them again depends on just *how much* of a premium price is being charged."
9168,"Fantastically exfoliating_I like good exfoliation, and this brush is the best one that I've tried for feeling really clean.The bristles are perfect, they aren't scratchy, just firm enough to provide a good scrub, they do soften just a bit in hot water, but not too soft. The length works well for me, and the brush size is just right. The handle is sturdy enough that even with firm use it hasn't snapped. That's been an issue in the past. It's ridged in just the right place to keep it gripped with wet hands.My skin feels softer, and my back feels really clean using this brush. The color is great too, the bright pretty pink is very happy looking.[The product reviewed was provided to me at no cost for the purposes of review. I received no other compensation, and my review is my honest opinion of the product.]"
3678,I love this_Love this and love the vivite line. Great stuff. See much improvement. Will reorder and keep using to wipe away some of the years.
7180,"opi did you hear about Van Gogh?_I received the package today. The packaging was great arrived in perfect condition! I gave 5 stars because the color matches the picture and matches with anything I wear ,all I did was apply a top coat over the polish and it looks great also the seller did a great job preparing for shipment! Thankyou!"
3377,"Review of Avon Moisture Hand Cream_Not every hand cream works for every one.  This one did NOT work for me, but that doesn't mean it will not work for you.  It felt like Vaseline, and has no scent, but heavy.  I don't even know if it works because I was distracted by the heaviness of the product, and how I accidentally ordered two of them."
2403,"Cute buns_I bought several of these and are really good quality, the only reason I gave it only 4 stars is because it takes too Long to arrive, but the price is worth the wait.  Very easy to use and the size is big, perfect for any medium to Long length hair."
6706,Neat_Seems like a neat idea that can be used to beginners and experts a like. Anyone looking into seriously gettings into nails should have one of these lights in their home.
1537,"i love it_this product cleans the oils on my scalp & extends periods between washing.also,when i do shampoo it helps to clean scalp quicker & with less scrubbing"
1835,"First Time Trying Mango Butter_I mixed this mango butter into my homemade leave-in hair conditioner and used it after my co-wash. I also use other essential oils plus shea butter. I was concerned my final recipe would be little heavy, but my hair loves it and it turned out soft and very moisturized. The final result whipped into a light souffl&eacute;. I like variety in my homemade recipes and this mango butter will definitely be a staple in my natural hair care routine and maintenance.The ingredients for my homemade recipe: Shea butter, mango butter, olive oil, jojoba oil, grapeseed oil, castor oil, vitamin E oil, jasmine oil for fragrance. (I melt the butters first by putting them in a small bowl and sitting the smaller bowl in a larger shallow bowl of hot water). I whip all the ingredients together with a hand blender. I place the final whip into a clean plastic BPA free bowl with a lid and will place it in the freezer for 15 minutes to set. Thereafter, I place the leave-in conditioner back in the frig until I'm ready to use it.The amounts of butter and oils can be tweaked depending on your hair needs and amount of conditioner you want to make at one time. I tend to make enough to last no more than 2 weeks and I keep all my finished homemade products stored either in the refrigerator or a cool place like my linen closet. I've never had a batch go bad, but I tend to make only enough to last for 1-2 weeks. I also use this as a general skin balm conditioner as well."
3800,Soft hair_I have never even colored my hair at home so I figured this would be safe since no color was involved. It was alright and did seem to work but don't think I will bother with it again. My hair has never been dyed and I love it the way it is.
2539,Really like this cleanser_I have been using this product since the summer and really like it.  I have used other Jan Marini products and wanted this to go along w/ the other facial items.  I think it does a fantastic job.  I had been having lots of breakouts and was having a hard time getting rid of them.  This cleanser does a fantastic job of getting into your pours w/o drying out your skin.  It says to use a quarter size amount but I think that you can use less.  Just recently I started using it in the morning and at night and again- Not Drying!  It is not recommend as use for a makeup remover and I agree.  It just doesn't take the eye makeup off.  So I just use something else for that and then f/u w/ this cleanser.
6514,"Liked the colors, but the palette fell apart_I loved using this for smokey eyeshadow. Well, for the 2 weeks the palette stayed intact.I opened it up one day and half the eyeshadows had almost exploded, and got everywhere. I had a similar experience with the Coastal Scents Contour palette, as well.I really wanted to like these products."
3270,"Recieved wrong product, issued a return_I received lipstick whereas I ordered lip pencil. Lip pencil is supposed to be much better for you lips. I am very disappointed. The color looked pink online but what I received was definitely bronze.UPDATEI did return the product at my expense and after following up I received a prompt refund. I'm guessing this was a fluke."
2756,"didn't work for me_I bought this after reading the positive reviews, but it didn't do much for my skin. I still get breakouts and my skin is still oily (with dry patches) after using this face wash. I like the smell of it though. I bought this in a four pack so now I have to finish using them, but probably won't purchase again."
2766,"Best Mousse EVER!_Ok let me First say this. I saw another review that said this product is not 100% Organic. Yes, this is true. However, this mousse is thee closest to organic, you'll ever find. The ingrediants are also very good, as well!Now about how this product works. I have very thick, straight to wavy, puffy dry hair. When I first tried this mousse, I was amazed and shocked. My puffyness went away in my hair-and it was so, so easy to manage my hair (for once in my life)! It basically enhanced my hair and the waves in my hair. It was not sticky at all (like other mousse's). If you have frizzy hair, I'd HIGHLY reccommend this product. I use this to 'calm' my hair down and to enhance my hair (and manage it). It also makes your hair extremely soft (in a pleasant way). It does hold your hair (if needed as well), let me give an example. When your hair is wet or towel-dried (from the shower) You can put this stuff sporadically in your hair. This will just relax and manage your hair (you won't have frizzies or unmagable hair). This will also make your hair more soft when it dries. Or, when your hair is DRY, you can apply this and it will stiffen your hair somewhat (to style or to get any frizzies down). Also, if you want, you can brush your hair and it will feel extra smooth.I came into this brand a couple of years ago and they are truly amazing. The mousse is just one of many. And they've been around before all this other semi-organic stuff came out. Highly reccommend."
1224,"favorite_I love the floral scent. I switch around a bit, but this is my favorite fragrance. Seems like so many fragrances these days smell like grapefruits; this one smells like flowers.  I always receive compliments. It's not over powering either."
454,"best mascara ever_I use fake lashes to give extra volume to my lashes but sometimes it's just too much of a hassle. This is the only mascara that comes close to the results i get with the fake lashes. Truly, no other brand works this well. Some people complain that it's clumpy, but this brand isnt for a clean look, it's for a false lash effect! Anyway, dont love the price, but i have to use four times as much of the drugstore brand to even come close to this, so it's even."
3232,"Did not work for me_Over the years I've tried many styling products to tame frizz and get the 'lush curls' look.  I started out with silicone based products but didn't like those so I kept trying different things without it.  I finally found a combination that works well but am always open to trying new products so I decided to give this line a try.  I bought the starter kit that has shampoo, conditioner, this product, and the leave in conditioner and used them all together to get a good idea of how well the products work.  Although it's better than nothing, it did not tame the frizz very well and did nothing in particular to make my hair look good.  Disappointing, especially for such an expensive product.  However, it's great that inventors are always developing new products because everyone's hair is different.  It does have nice citrusy fragrance.For those who are interested in what does work for me: I use any inexpensive shampoo and conditioner; I notice little difference in those so why pay more.  For styling, I use Garnier Fructis Pure Clean Smoothing Cream.  Then my secret weapon is to follow that with Palmer's Coconut Oil Formula Hair Conditioner, a leave-in dressing which leaves my hairdo looking shiny and lush. The key for the latter us to use just a very small amount and only apply to dry hair.  Both are far less expensive and do a better job on my hair."
9170,Bargain_This is definitely a bargain.  I have only used these polishes for stamping.  They work pretty well.  They are certainly quite a deal!
8468,"Very convenient; like the scent_I've never used an all-in-one soap/shampoo before so I wasn't quite sure that it would work well. Well, it does! I'm very impressed with the amount of lather produced, and love the scent. It's sort of strong when using it, but it doesn't linger long after showering. To me, the scent is very fresh-smelling.The only complaint I have is with the bottle itself. I like that it has a push button that releases the cap since I have very limited patience with fiddling with bottle opening the first thing in the morning. However, the cap is rounded, which means I can't store it upside down when it gets low to ensure all the product gets used. I can prop it up against the wall and it sort of, kind of stays put, but it will topple over easily.But, the performance and scent make up for that packaging miss, so I'll keep it at 5-stars. Very convenient to use, and works great as a soap and a shampoo."
8598,"Is it really that difficult to design a good hair dryer?_It's hard to believe that Remington could produce such a flawed dryer, but they managed to do so, with this model.First of all, it's larger/bulkier than it needs to be,  so just storing it on a bathroom counter top or wherever, requires more space than normal. But the real design flaw with this dryer is its heat control.  It has only two fan speeds, which might suffice if they had gotten the heat control designed correctly.  Instead, one of the three heat settings is useless (the lowest setting supplies almost no noticeable heat), and so you really have less heat 'range' than many other hair dryers.So the lowest heat setting provides virtually NO heat at all,  the second ('medium')  setting provides about the right heat for many people's hair, while the third (high) setting is quite hot, so you have to be careful using it. Because the useful number of heat & fan settings are so limited, there is no excuse for this hair dryer to be as bulky and heavy as it is."
2977,"Nice Product_After going through the 14 day program I didn't notice a huge difference. But I'm not sure that 14 days is actually long enough, it should probably be for at least 28 days. After all we didn't get those fine lines and wrinkles in 14 days so how can you cure them in that amount of time.  On the plus side my skin does seem to be more soft and hydrated so it did it's job in at least that aspect, and I really enjoyed the nightly routine and pleasant fragrance. Bottom line I will probably try it again next winter when my skin needs extra care. Otherwise I'll just stick to the regenerist."
2075,"The truth!!!_I have yet to find a product that yields results like this!!!! This product coupled with the kinky curly custard is AMAZING! My curls are left defined, soft and COMPLETELY frizz free! I wash my hair with sulfate free shampoo and use this as a leave in conditioner, use the kinky curly custard in sections, and then diffuse my hair and get GREAT results. The first time I used this product I received so many compliments at work about my hair. It leaves it so shiny, and with great curl definition. I also am able to achieve fourth day hair with this product...LOVE IT!!!!!!"
3827,"Oohhhhhhh yesssss!!!_I love this concealer palette!! It was my first palette, and will be the only one I use!! It works amazing both Queen Latifah Cover girl and Bare Minerals!!! Definitely a must have for your makeup collection!!!"
5494,"I thought it would be better_Everyone said this brush dryer is so great -- but I am finding it hard to work with and very noisy !!It heats up well but the spin speed goes too fast -- I find it hard to control and it just grabs my hair .In theory, this is a good idea.  I am not sure it works in reality.  I may have to return this."
220,"Hair color smears all over and melts in the heat!_I have used this product before except I bought it at my hair salon.  That one worked well.  So well, that I decided to buy again except I saw this one online and it was cheaper.  But, this one purchased online got all over my hands as soon as I touched my hair lightly, got on my shirt when I pulled it over my head, dripped down the side of my face when I perspired.  Awful.  Wish I could return it but I didn't pay that much so let's just say its one lesson learned."
4370,smells great_I like this baby wash.  Baby smells wonder and it leaves her skin looking refreshed and glowing.  She like to rub it on herself.  It's fun!
8205,"great lotion_I bought this on a chance not having tried it before and I was not disappointed. The price is great for the amount and it smells so good, it goes on not too thick but keeps your skin moisturized all day. It isn't greasy or heavy, it absorbs quickly."
7875,Crap_These are absolutely horrible!! They do not stick at all and the glue sucks too. I can't believe I wasted my money on junk like this. Now ima have to trash them
8398,"fun_I like these cause you can make your plain nail look like you went and had them done , and it give you a chance to be crafty"
4577,"Smooth Face_I love this stuff. After using for about a month or so, I haven't found anything that works better. Even though its an acid, there is nothing acidic feeling about it.I've been trying to use more basic forms of face care, instead of lotions and creams with lots of ingredients. This is a great product and was delivered very quickly. I use it without diluting it, straight on my face and rub in a little extra on problem areas. It really helps with small bumps and discolorations. It can also go on under make up and actually helps with application. It has no smell and feels super silky.Some people have had rashes after using it, so try a little at first.Also, the seller delivered the product really quickly."
4870,LOVE IT_GREAT PIGMENTS.ALOT OF DIFFERENT COLORS TO TRY OUT.I WILL BE BUYING 2 MORE NEXT WEEK.THE SHIMMER COLORS ARE GREAT FOR CORNERS OF EYES AND CHEEKS.PERFECT PALETTE TO USE FOR PARTIES AND MORE.
4975,"Love It!_This is the only conditioner that leaves my coarse gray hair even close to being soft.  Oh, and I love the smell!"
106,Great Moisturizer_i mix this with Booster C Powder and i've notice a big difference in only two weeks. No foundation Needed.
3823,"Really Great To Have!_I wanted to wait until I used it for awhile before reviewing.  I'm a darkskinned African American female and I use 4 of the shades in here.  Its so convienent to have because you can use the the different shades for different things.  I use one color for under my eyes, another to cover dark marks on my face, another for under my eybrows and another for the lighter parts of my face.  It's nice and thick and covers well.  I like to use my concealer brush instead of my fingers and the coverage is perfect!  This is a must have if you are trying to step up your makeup game."
9994,"Best brushes on the market!_Bravo!!! Another perfect brush for my &#34;Junkee collection&#34;!! As usual, I have put it through the rigors of different products, mineral and liquid and it performs beautifully. I have a horrible time covering my dark circles and fine lines under my eyes and this little miracle has saved me. I also cleaned it six times so far and not one hair has shed, hasn't lost it's shape a bit. The fibers a very, very dense and the weight of the brush is great. You can go to the Beauty Junkees youtube channel and watch her tutorials with different brushes that she offers and her techniques. Good stuff. I will continue buying anything they put out."
7217,Bad_Looks so cheap just buy at the shopNot working wellWaste money to buy this stuffDo not buy here
6656,Does not work_Tried and tried but could not get it to work.  My daughter spent and hour trying to get the darn thing to work.  Not worth the money.
1097,"Excellent!_This is one of my favorites! I recommend it, the product came on their box! It is great and very cheap!"
5353,Great primer for the price_Lightweight primer lightly masks flaws and evens out some redness. I have sensitive skin and have irritation with some primers but not this one. It also tones down the shine on your face. I put it on after using a high end moisturizer
7767,"Work perfectly for what I wanted_I actually purchased these to use in my card-making, not on nails.  They work perfectly, and are a much better price than any craft stores or even local nail stores."
8195,"great product!_great price, great size, great colors! everything i could possibly need for a cheek in any beauty makeup situation! love!"
1145,"Seems to work._I have had terrible blackheads on my nose for a few years now.  So I decided to try these and I have been pleased with the result.  The scent of the oils is a strong one, but invigorating nonetheless.  I don't really see a lot of dirt or anything like that when I pull the strip off, but my nose has been clearing up so they do work.  I plan on continuing with these since I haven't had luck with anything else and these do clear up my nose."
4880,Fantastic toner_I have tried several Shea Tera products and haven't been disappointed with any of them. They are gentle and effective!
6312,"Works beautifully!_I switched to this from the Anew 7s Night Cream only because of the strong scent of the Anew product. Happy to say I love this formula as well and get unexpected compliments about my 'great complexion' when least expected. What's interesting is that if you run you fingers over your face, throat & chest in the morning before you wash yourself up to prepare for your day treatments,  little micro-peels slough off your skin. With patience, diligence and time you'll have a whole new constantly refreshed complexion with steady use of this particular night cream. Good Luck!  Anew Genics Treatment Cream 30g/1fl.oz"
1162,Finally!!_I found this online at a wonderful price not including the shipping.  This is one of those things I would always forget to buy while at the store so I ordered it online.  I am very pleased with the packaging and shipping of this product. I recommend everyone shop online with Amazon.com
3876,"The BEST ..._The BEST ...Skin care...Skincare LdeL Cosmetics Retinol Night Cream, 1.7-Ounce Jar....Highly recommend it soaks in nit greasy and reasonable price."
5658,Excellent seller_Bought these for my grand daughter to add to her kit for her apprentiship. She likes the style and the color which matches another part of her kit.
3320,"Good bang for your buck_I found the consistency and quality of this product to be comparable to other, higher-end, concealers I've purchased.  Love that it doesn't crease under my eyes.  The yellow is great as a highlighter."
5635,"Love them!_These are mini nail polishes, so they are good for anyone, even kids! The colors are excellent and very pretty. I highly recommend these to anyone."
8601,"Wonderful foaming soap_I have used a lot of foaming soaps-this one by Lysol is one of the best.  Notice that the product bills itself as 'Touch of Foam'--that is really true.  Unlike a lot of other foaming soaps, this foaming soap is not messy.  When you use the pump to apply this soap, the foam stays in one place on your hand-unlike other soapy products that mess up your entire hand, sleeve, pump, sink, etc.  The pump is easy to use, and has continued to work well despite being nearly empty at this point at my house.  My kids and husband love this soap. The scent is mild, the combination of lavender and vanilla is very likeable.  Lysol's Touch of Foam foaming hand soap is also very inexpensive-compared to say, Bath and Body works foaming soaps it is a much better deal. Not only does the pump works better, so you get more product but the soap is far superior.  My family highly recommends this product."
5054,took these to China_We took these masks to China but we never needed them there. The weather was fine and we didn't need to take them.
1427,Great product_I have bought many deep steep bubble baths.  I also like to use them as body washes.  They smelll great and have a great lather.
7452,"Good conditioner but poor packaging_I can't count the number of conditioners that I've tried and then thrown in the trash in an effort to give my fine hair some needed volume.  This conditioner does do what it claims to do--volume without weight and it smells good.I'll probably buy it again. However, I wish it came in a more friendly container.  It is difficult for my arthritic hands to hold the 12 oz bottle which has an odd shape.  The L'Oreal Ever Pure shampoo and conditioners are much, much easier to hold."
8248,"Works for dark circles_I'm 31 and have always had dark circles around my eyes, especially since having my son two years ago.  I've been using this product for 2-3 months and have noticed an improvement in the skin tone around my eyes.  It's much more even, now.  I use this twice a day, nearly every day.  I've not had any irritation but I do not normally have sensitive skin.  It has not caused any breakouts, either.It comes in a fairly large container for an eye treatment.  After almost 3 months, I might be about halfway into it and I've been applying it generously.  After dipping further into the product, the oil starts to collect on the surface.  It's not overly oily upon application.  When I apply makeup over it, it tends to become a little flaky at first but it seems to stay on for most of the day.I'm pleased with it, so far."
9571,"Fantastic!!_I use my Hyaluronic Acid Serum on a clean dry face. The serum has an airless pump that always gives me just the correct amount of serum. A small amount goes a long way. Within just a few minutes my face has a rosy glow. This serum doesn&#8217;t sting. There is no discomfort at all. That&#8217;s because there is no alcohol or SLS&#8217;s. Nothing that will clog my pores or cause any irritation. My face just looks BRIGHT!!!This really is an amazing anti-aging serum. I noticed a difference in laugh lines the first day I used this! The pump helps you to use just the perfect amount, which is a small amount! Which also means that this 1.7 ounce bottle will last a long time!! Also a bonus for me is that the airless pump extends the life of the serum. SWEET!!!I'd give this 100 stars if I could!!"
8832,"darker than picture_this polish isn't even close to the colour pictured when viewing with my monitor.  on the other hand, i was expecting a pure matte (don't know how people could think this is a gloss), so i was pleasantly surprised by the shimmer in it.  it's a bit darker and greener than how the colour appears on my monitor and it's very pretty."
8503,"I like it_Sometimes I need to freshen my hair but don't have time for a shampoo in the middle of the day.  I have oily hair and it can get oily looking really quickly.  This is a great product in between shampoos.  The foam goes on wet and made my hair look really wet, but once it dries, quickly, and you style your hair as usual it looks great.  It isn't quite as good as a shampoo, but it's really close.  I will buy it again."
9630,"Left me splotchy and orange_This felt food enough going on, and I thought I'd really like it when I first used it.  It has fragrance but it was very pleasant and my skin felt moisturized after I'd applied it.The next morning I woke up and looking down at my feet I just looked splotchy.  The color was a bit peachy but it was ok, but I was definitely splotchy looking.I put more one the next night but awoke to find myself downright orange.I'm a very fair person- I always wear the lightest shades of makeup for instance.  I have never had any luck at all with ANY self tanner, but I hoped this one might be different as they are getting better as  the years pass.  This color was just too intense for me.  It was not gradual enough on a very fair person.  I might need a fair-fair level but this was the lightest they had.On a positive note, it didn't discolor my palms or and my knees looked ok.  I did wash my hands good after use & was careful of my knees and elbows.."
452,"works great!_works great, easy to use and safe on hair. My hair does not feel damaged or fried. Very happy with this item"
8516,"Dove Men+Care Sensitive Scalp Shampoo and Conditioner_I like this shampoo because it works well, smells great and leaves my hair clean.  It lathers immensely and the tingling feeling I got from the menthol didn't irritate me scalp.  The fact that it is a shampoo and conditioner in one is definitely a plus."
6273,Dove vs Olay_I personally like Dove body wash better than Olay; it has a richer lather and doesn't dry out the skin. It's cheap through the Subscribe and save!
5583,"Love to hate it._It causes me pain, but I like it so far. It leaves my face red, but that means that it works. I&#8217;ve got it in perfect condition (some people here were complaining about it being broken) and so far I&#8217;m happy with it.It&#8217;s painful on some areas more than others (or that&#8217;s just with me), but I guess it depends on pressure as well; pushing it more into skin means more pain, but I might as well since I want to see the full results and take the full advantage of the device. I apply a lotion afterwards and my face is still a little red in the morning. I&#8217;ve noticed fewer scars in just a few weeks. I&#8217;ll see how it goes with this one as far as pain and maybe in a future get the 1.5mm&#8230;.but not yet."
3914,I am a make-up junkie and really like this concealer in the yellow_I am a make-up junkie and really like this concealer in the yellow.  It goes on smooth and is great for us sleep deprived mommies trying to hide some dark circles.
4868,"SHANY 28 color Blush palette - Blush it, contour it and shade it - all in one_I love this product!Some of the pink blushes are REALLY pigmented so be VERY  light handed with them otherwise your gonna look like a clown.The contour colors are wonderful too."
4598,Great Product_I really like this one.  I do feel like it really gets my skin super clean.  Clears out the clogged pores and does it with natural ingredients.
8575,color me happy_Nice smooth consistancy excellent for nail art designs. Here's a tip when using acrylic paint for nail art water down the paint till you can easily draw a linen it's strong in color and it don't run. They you are good too. I find this brand is the best and a little goes a long way.
5932,"A bit too long_All in all, I really like these lashes.  They're good quality (especially for the price) and look very lovely on.  The one gripe I have about them is that the strips themselves are a bit too long.  To be fair, most false eyelash strips are, but these are the longest ones I've seen and I'm no stranger to falsies.  They also all have a little section of the strip on each side with no lashes on them that has to be cut off before wearing.  I would buy these again though."
2440,"Works, but takes a little patience_I agree with all the other reviewers . . . it works well on a specific type of blemish (for me at least) - the kind that is raised and filled with goo (whatever you call what's inside of a pimple).  Clogged pores, whiteheads, blackheads - doesn't do anything for them - better to exfoliate and use a salicylic/glycolic acid combo to keep those clean.Only drawbacks are that you can only treat a few blemishes at a time and each treatment takes about 2 1/2 minutes.  That's a bit of time holding the Zeno to your face/body, but worth it to get rid of the blemish in a non-pinching way."
1357,Great moisturizing treatment!_Anything Mizani has my vote!  This product is no exception.  It provide intense treatment and moisture especially during the winter months when your hair is its driest.  Repeat purchase!
6749,Liked it a lot_Pretty awesome for being so affordable. I mostly use this to contour and highlight my nose. It's a little too greasy for all over my face but I have sensitive skin
6817,Nail Forms_I bought these because i couldn't find the YSNails ones...and these work just fine.  they are definitely not for plus sized nails/people because they are not wide enough..BUT for average people / average sized nail beds they work great.  my daughter has super tiny nail beds and these are her favorites to use.  they are super easy to use...just make sure that you keep your acrylic material from settling in the center of the form...keep pushing the material / acrylic up the sides and make sure to make the nail thick enough otherwise the nail will just come off or break off...they are good quality and the shipping was super fast in fact i do need to get more of these...
1782,"TOP NOTCH PRODUCTS_I've been using a panoply of Cellbone Technology products including this one. You can definitely spend more of your money without getting the same results from this glycolic acid peel. My regimen is: weekly peel, bi-weekly collagen masque with daily application of their excellent hyperpeptides liquid in combination with their stem cell lotion.I brought these products to my plastic surgeon and she was duly impressed with the potency of these products. I can tell you that it has made a huge difference in the texture of my skin and wrinkles? Well, a couple of friends commented that I keep looking younger and younger.These products are well worth the money!"
4794,"Curly hair don't care_You need to have this if you love curly hair, if you love to curl your hair and only have a short time in the morning this works great!! It curls in minutes and stays. Heats up very quickly and does the job. You can make small curls or larger curls depending how you use it. I'm happy with my purchase and will order the 1 1/2"
8509,"Love it_My boys love this product, they said it really helps.  Make sure you follow the instructions and realize this is not an every day type shampoo."
5152,"Eternal Rose is a winner!_I bought L'Oreal Paris Infalible Le Rouge Lipcolour in Eternal Rose after seeing it on Kate Beckinsale in Allure magazine last year. I've worn it off and on for months now and finally decided it was worth reviewing. Not only because the formula lasts through a lot but because this color is awesome, I really think it would flatter most women who look good in shades of rose.Ultimately, what made me decide I loved this lipstick was that I went out to a party where I ate saucy meatballs and drank wine and such. When I got home and got ready for bed my lipstick was still there! I've never had a lipstick last through messy foods and a couple of glasses of wine. I will be on the lookout for other great colors because this licolour really is infallible. :)"
1678,Great mousse blush maybelline all ways come though with great products._Iam so happy I found this  for some reason lately I have not been able to find the mousse blush any where it's not like they are not stocking this item where I live but I found it on here I got the pink frosting one I have two others that are half empty but different shades I like this blush cause it last all day and I don't have to retouch at all very fast shipping from web's best deals shipping was free will deal with this seller again cause they have this blush and what a great price as well could it beat it.
7125,"does a really good of reducing shine_Let me preface this review by saying that I've never really used primer before (for my face), so I can't compare this with other anti-shine primers. But I can tell you that my skin is really oily. Oil slick oily. Mirror reflective oily. After two hours of leaving the house in the morning, it looks like I've dipped my T-zone in a vat of grease.When using Shine Killer, I feel I'm able to cut down that oiliness by about 70%. My skin is not matte all day, but the shine is more reasonable/natural looking, (maybe manages to look 'dewy'?) like you don't have powder on, and I can live with that. I only blot lightly once or twice during the day to get it down to a more 'matte' look.I find this product affordable and you only need to use a little amount (for me, just to cover the T-zone). It also did not make me break out, but I can't guarantee that for all skin types."
6011,"Very disappointing_Very disappointed in this moisturizer.  I had the impression that it would not have a darkish  tinted color.  The tint is much too dark for January in Pennsylvania--just not natural looking.However, what really warrants one star is that it made me break out.  I do not get pimples--never did.  Funny that within a couple weeks after using this product, I developed two within two days of each other.  I have concluded causation is the Olay CC Cream."
910,This is great!_I love this shampoo! It has such a great smell and leaves my hair soft and shiny. I will keep this shampoo around. :)
1168,"Phytod Frisant Botanical Hair Relaxing Balm_Love this product!!! It works so well, that when styling my hairit comes out almost as good as when done in a salon."
4343,DISPOSABLE SHOWER CAPS - 100 PACK_Actually use them for dish covers as well as shower caps.  They work great when you can't find a lid for that bowl that you needed.
5864,"A better buy, then the 21 pc._I got both bundles. I must say I like this set better then the 21pc. Unlike the first set this one is nearly flawless. Plate BM203 has burns on two of the designs, I haven't used this plate yet but it shouldn't interfere with the stamping process. The full nail deigns are bigger but still leave a thin space for me.Pros:Many deigns to pick from.Cheaper, then other plates.Cons:They are dupes."
1802,"To greasy_When I think of a Gel Cr&egrave;me, I think differently then what the product was.  It is greasy and not recommended for oily skin!"
6622,"I thought this Suave Body Wash would smell better_I read the reviews on this and it sounded like something I would like but it is not for me.  I'm sure I can find friends and family members who may like the scent more than I do.  I love, love, love Suave products as a general rule and recommend them all the time but this wasn't one of them."
1361,mild enough to use on face -- excellent value compared to dept store_I've used more expensive oils before (Clarins) but thisis far more effective and pleasant smelling. The all naturalingredients are soothing and did help with cellulite somewhat.A great gift too!UPDATE: I now use 'Josie Maran Argan Oil' instead of this.
7971,"I love it - but use it carefully_I have somewhat oily skin - which is okay with me as I have always looked 10-15 years younger than I am.  However, after starting medication for ADD, my skin started producing MORE oil, which led to serious acne issue.  I tried a lot of  things, including honey (which has natural antibacterial properties), apple cider vinegar, etc.  But nothing was working.I went to a skin specialist, and she recommended this Clarisonic Pro.  I've used it with the Skin Medica acne wash.  And my skin is finally clearing up!However, I do want to caution:I was using it twice a day. I went to a new esthetician and she told me that my skin was becoming to thin with the use of the Clarisonic.  She said that I should only use it once or twice per week.  So, please be careful and make sure that you're checking in with your esthetician or dermatologist regularly.Recommend."
8777,Magic_I love this stuff. I don't know what it is made of- probably unicorns. But I am fine with that because it makes magic. My fuzzy snarly hair looks great. I did keratin treatments for a while but that got tedious and expensive. But when I use this I get the same look as my brazilian blowout. It leaves my hair silky shiny and flexible. It also lasts.Definitely a winner.
1328,Didn't like it_I bought this after using excuvience because of the price difference. Doesn't compare. I have moderate acne and this did nothing for me. Didn't help with my dry skin either. Now I'm back to excuvience.
5806,"AWESOME INVENTION!_If you wear mascara, YOU NEED THIS! This prevents mascara from getting on your eyelid, a problem that many mascara-wearers have faced.great invention!"
2267,Awesome pink grapefruit scent_This stuff smells great! I love the smell of grapefruit and few products REALLY have that fresh grapefruit scent. This is absolutely delicous. Thanks!
1649,"Great for Oily or Combo Sensitive Skin!_This product is a godsend in the summer; your make-up will stay on and shine is eliminated.Plus, it helps ease the redness and irritation in the blemishes while also helping to clear them up!I use it in the t-zone, only.Amazing!"
3545,"Good bar soap._I'm very happy with the Burt's Bees natural men bar soap. I prefer body washes (easier and faster to soap myself), but if I had to use a bar soap, it would probably be this one."
8904,"I love this funny looking thing!_OK, this looks silly and unnecessary, but I tell you: if you have hundreds of brushes to wash at the same time, this is sent from the heavens! If you have lots of brushes, buy this, you won't regret it."
282,Great Product_I have always been a fan of Mane and Tail products. They make th hair feel healthy and manageable. Hat is off to Mane and Tail!
1771,"Just OK_Overall, this product is OK for the price. However, the color selection is just terrible. The Medium 2 is one of the darkest mediums that I have ever seen. Any thing above 2 is very dark for white skin. In addition, many of the collections have a lot of pink undertones, such as the Light 5 - it's pink, pink, pink.All in all, this foundation is difficult to 'get right.' I was hopeful that this might substitute for my favorite - but expensive - Benefit foundation. It doesn't.If you are looking for pink or dark selections, you have found the right product line. Otherwise, keep looking."
3595,"NIce_I kind of thought it was going to be bigger but maybe that was just my misconception. It worked faster and better than the store bought brand. All in all, I like it."
4320,"An outstanding foundation_I've been using this excellent foundation for several years. Originally an over-the-counter product, it has disappeared from department stores so I was delighted to find it on this site. Although feather light, it achieves good coverage and the color itself is so natural that it matches my skin tone perfectly, which is diffcult for warm olive skin. It stays on all day and a bottle goes a long way, making it also economical. You will love this makeup."
3132,"Really worked for us!_Our teenage son had a pretty bad case of dermatitis on his scalp and we tried multiple different products without any positive results. Then we tried this Selsun Blue Naturals. This shampoo really helped after several weeks of consistent usage. We didn't see immediate changes, but after extended use, it made a huge difference. I don't think we even realized how much it was helping until one day I noticed him itching his scalp again and asked if he was still using his shampoo. He said that he had run out. I purchased another bottle off of Amazon and within a week or so, things were back under control. May not work for every case, but really made a difference for us."
696,Works wonders!_I use this as a hair mask when my hair is feeling very dry and it works wonders. I also dab a tiny bit on my lips when they are feeling chapped. There are so many uses for coconut oil. It's amazing.
1533,"Staying power_Once I applied this lacquer, never needed to touch it again.Absolutely stays on till you want it off. No bad smell. High shine, beautiful color .Lips look plumped and full of moisture."
6962,"Healthy Hair Plus .. GREAT SHAMPOO!!_I am loving this shampoo. My scalp was oily and had an odor as well as my hair. I could really smell it when I blow dried my hair. After using this shampoo, My scalp feels refreshed and clean, I have past shoulder length hair with hi lite's It was always difficult to comb through after shampoo and conditioner, With the Healthy Hair shampoo it combs through easily, I will definitely buy more."
1989,"First Time Able to Comb Through Hair Without Tangles and Pulls!_Review of: Motions At Home Deep Penetrating Treatment Conditioner, 10 oz Jar.My wife loves this product.  Her hair is very thick and long.  She claims that upon initial use it was the first time she was able to comb through her hair without tangles and pulls.  In short, she uses it to tame her mane!  She recommends using it approximately twice per week.  Any more than that she contends would weigh the hair down too much.  She loves it.  Five stars."
671,"So far so good_I recently cut all my hair off and went natural. Since then I have been trying different products to keep my hair moisturized without looking greasy. I was kind of skeptical to purchase this reading the reviews but decided to give it a try anyway and so far so good. It arrived a day prior to the scheduled delivery date in the pictured container and looked and smelled how I imagined. Unlike other reviews, I do not have a problem with the consistency, smell or any grit...it felt like butter...exactly what it is. I did put some on my face overnight and my skin already feels amazing so I will add this to my nightly routine. I do not suggest that you wear it on your body if you plan to go out of the house. I put some on my hair this morning after co-washing it and it doesnt look greasy or feel heavy. I've read that you shouldnt microwave these kind of butters because it takes away some of the benefits so I melted it in a bowl in a double boiler and it melted perfectly. I will update this review and let you know how it lasts throughout the day but for now I'm glad that I bought this."
7121,"Better than competitor!_This product is far superior to the other brand which makes a similar product, and cheaper. Medicine Mama's product had a superior consistency (creamy and easily spreadable) and has less of a beeswax smell. This &#34;bee cream&#34; is amazing for dry feet, nighttime face moisturizer, and general deep moisturizer.  It's best used in winter or for VERY dry skin. I love that it also comes in a stick for use on-the-go. Love it!!"
6448,Sticky? Dirty?_I'm not even sure how to describe this stuff once it is in the hair. I used different amounts and it all turned out the same. The product is really light and fluffy. It is white. This bottle is TINY! A bit bigger than a roll of quarters. Not a huge deal as I feel $10 is not much for a small product if it works. This one did not.Sprinkled it on to dry hair. Moved things around to fluff up the hair. Ok got some volume. 2 hours later I got the bathroom looks ok but has fallen a tad flat. Use my hand to puff it back up. Gross what is that feeling? It was a little sticky but felt a bit oily and dirty. I only used it on the back of the crown. I touch the front of my hair often. Glad each time I tried this product I did not use it towards the front of my hair.In a average day I had fluff my hair back up about every hour. Next day that area felt so gross. Oily and tacky. I had white stuff in that area.This product is not for me. The feeling alone grossed me out and then it never kept volume.
3443,Haven't really seen a difference_I bought this to help reduce the wrinkles around my eyes.  I haven't seen a difference. I have used almost the entire tube of deep wrinkle treatment so far around my eyes. No change...
3432,best blush_I love this product! Best blush ever! It smells great and goes on easy AND leaves my skin feeling nourished!
1812,NOT FOR ME_My hair felt dry and it was dull looking with this product...Its not for me...It may work good on someone else hair....somethings just dont work for some pple and this is one of these things that just dont work for me....but maybe for u it will...I heard great things about it...But like i said its just not for me..
564,Decent base coat. Nothing I couldn't live without._Pros:  keeps my nails from staining when using deep colors; applies easily; dries quicklyCons: none really. There just isn't anything so super amazing about this that made it deserve 5 stars.
5693,"just as beautiful and ruby pumps_This deep green reminds me of a field of evergreen trees in the middle of winter being struck by sunlight.The picture does this polish no justice, the glitter is so heavy in this polish that is sparkles effortlessly. A perfect winter polish."
2070,Do not buy from this retailer(Revised)_This is my first review on Amazon.  I love Amazon!  But go to the Kinky-Curly website to buy this product.  The price here is exorbitant to the point where it must be a typo.Revised:  Looks like the original price has been lowered to a more sane price point.  Kudos!
6364,This powder is almost as good as the Joan Rivers product_I think it's almost as good as the Joan Rivers product and I love that one.  This is a little easier to spread and I like to mix this medium Brown with Dark Blonde in the Joan Rivers product. This one is a tad lighter than the other.  I like it!
7194,"Good but goopy_Excellent top coat that dries my nail polish in seconds!  My only complaint is that it gets really gloopy even when I use the thinner.  I'm not even half way through it and it needs to be thinned every use.The base coat, on the other hand, does not get gloopy (at least for me) and it works well too!"
3739,"Junk_This does not work. No matter how many times i read the instructions and even look up tutorials on youtube, this does not work. Save your money. I wish i would of."
7385,Better than I thought_I thought I was just buying regular combs. I wear my hair in a bun a lot and these really help keep the shorter fly aways in place. These combs are better quality than I have bought in the past. Boy to they make my hair feel tight!
2601,"19 year old building up my collection_Prior to buying this I use to just use my fathers ck escape or his polo cologne. he got tired of me going into his things so i saw this and i remembered trying the scent at kohls so i bought it. man do i love it, its not overpowering and it lasts quite awhile, i showered and can definitely still smell this. I recommend this product, and the shipping only took 2 days, no serial code was tampered with, and the box was in great condition. Do yourself a favor and stop reading this review and buy this product. for the price, ITS A ROB!!!"
594,"Nice_Easy to use, nice color, good grey coverage. It's less messy than my favorite brand, which costs quite a bit less. I'll still be keeping with the other organic henna."
7136,Nice cleanser_Motions Naturally You Moisturizing Cleanser is a great cleanser for individuals with dry hair.  It cleans and moisturizes simultaneously and doesn't seem to leave a coating on the hair like some moisturizing cleansers I've tried.  It smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft.  I noticed I don't have to use a conditioner after using this product.
3118,"Smell like Angel..._I originally bought this at Meijer, sad to say it cost me about 33., bucks..its cheaper on Amazon.Anyway, if you like Angel, by Terry Mulger...you'll LOVE this. I have angel, I ran empty on that bottle had it refiled many moons ago, it cost me under 40 bucks. I can't remember what it cost then because it was a gift, but I know its pricey. This has a soft scent with a lasting smell. Not overpowering at all. I love it."
3455,love it_I love urban decay to began with! all of their products are really good quality and work! hence the price but it is so worth it! if your tired of your eye shadow running and looking like its not even there half way through the day then you need this! It helps to make the eye shadow stick out more and keeps it in place until you take it off! great buy and by the way I've had mine for 9 moths! and still have so much more left. you only need to apply a tiny dab! remember ladies a little goes a long way!
117,"Good Reliable Cream_Not greasy at all! No scent. Thank God. Goes on easily and absorbs just as easily. Last long, too. good night cream. Or day. But I used at night."
96,"Authentic Tommy Colonge_- Tommy Hilfiger name brand. Some reviewers seem to think certain colognes have been not authentic, but anytime I buy from Amazon directly, shipped from and sold by Amazon, I have always gotten a retail packaged item.- Smells great, fresh, clean, and not overpowering.- Price is a little high for what I like to spend, but this is a good size supply that should last long enough to justify the price.- Overall I'm pleased with the product. Will I buy it again? Maybe. I like to try different colognes and also look at which happen to have  a lower price at the time I need to order, but if the price is right I'll likely try this cologne at least once more.- Amazon delivered quickly w Prime."
9211,Definitely works and is easy_It does curl you hair but your hair must be somewhat smoothed prior to the use or there is still some areas near your scalp that will be frizzy.  It is definitely easy to use as long as you follow the directions and does not tangle your hair if used properly.  For long hair it will curl a fair length but you cannot have a totally curled head.  Right after curling a length it has to cool for a bit so the curl can set.  I have been using some of the same products I use when I straighten my hair with this curler.
6652,"Love it!_Great mascara overall!  Easy to put on, looks good, makes my eye lashes look fuller and longer.  Highly recommend this product.  Shipping from Amazon was fast and price is comparable to local stores."
6019,"Didn't think it would work_I have to be honest. I really didn't think this product was worth it. I knew I wouldn't see results in one day but I definitely didn't expect to see results after two! I'm an dark-skinned African American and after applying this to the hyperpigmented marks on my face, I can definitely see a difference. In fact, I think I may even have to be careful because the spots are already starting to lighten a bit too much. But overall folks this really does work. Best part of all no breakouts and no horrible burning sensation and this is coming from someone with extremely sensitive skin and eczema lol."
8697,"Removes mascara easily, yet is contact friendly_I was surprised how much I like these wipes.  I know they cleanse well because they took off my waterproof mascara without any problem.  Yet, even though I rubbed them repeatedly at my lashline, they did not make my eyes sting, nor did they make my contacts blurry.  And then I was surprised how nice my skin felt afterwards.  It wasn't at all dry and tight; in fact, I skipped moisturizing, which I have never been able to do with any other brand of wash or wipe. At first my skin felt kind of coarse, but later, after it had thoroughly dried, it was noticeably smoother than usual.My only complaints would be that these are kind of expensive (though not out of line with other name-brand wipes) and I don't like the smell.  The smell isn't unpleasant, but a very light pleasant scent would have been nice.  However, I know the manufacturer avoided perfumes to eliminate any unnecessary sources of irritation.  And since my skin gets red and blotchy at the least provocation, but did not with these wipes, I appreciate that judgment call.Another drawback is that the wipes left enough of a film that my nose strip did not cling as well as usual.  On subsequent nights, I quickly rinsed my nose with plain water, and then the nose strips were fine.  And note that the film eventually is no longer noticeable.  I can't stand the feel of gunk on my face, but I was happy with how my skin felt once it dried.I would feel guilty about using these every day (especially when I'm not wearing makeup), but I do prefer them to anything else I've ever tried.  Since the wipes are large, I will probably cut them in half, or even into quarters (something I've done before with other face wipes)."
6972,"No complaints here_First off, thanks to the reviewer who took the extra time to read the ingredients and list them here - my eyes can't handle the small print on product packaging :)That said, I did like this product as a facial cleanser - not sure what the detoxifying means. I don't wear heavy makeup, and no mascara (allergies), so I'm not too fussy choosing facial cleaners as long as they aren't strongly scented and/or irritate my skin. I like the packaging with the push dispenser at the top, I can pump right into my hand without lifting it off the counter or spillage (big plus). It comes out nice and foamy without being thick and gooey, and rinses off quite easily. I didn't pick up on any strong perfumes either, another big plus for me. Definitely a product I would consider purchasing."
232,"Just what I was looking for!_I have very fine hair, but a great deal of it, and needed something for the shower to comb through conditioner. There are a lot of these on the market, but many of them break, and do not do a great job of making this an pain and snag free task. This one is sturdy and made for comfort."
1062,"Great Detangler_It really does work great if you want to brush your hair afterward... great for chemically treated hair that is a bit more elastic when wet (it also has proteins that will make hair firmer).  If you are looking for protein--- you found the product you're looking for.Other than that, nothing special.. perhaps it prevents more than it corrects.  I've noticed an increase in how 'wirey' the hair was (not something desirable in my frizzy hair).My sister's rave about it.. they have noticed increased shine and smoothness... maybe they have no other product to compare shine and smoothness with, since I've seen better results elsewhere for my hair.It will make your hair healthier, maybe not so much aesthetically.  I use it for brushing my hair and maintaining it's health.At least this product CHANGES the hair texture.  There are many out there like Dove Moisturizing Sprays that have imperceptible changes.The effects of this spray may or may not be desirable (like mine--wirey).  It all depends on your hair texture.I will keep it in my closet for maintaining hair health and split ends though.  Oh, did I mention it was great on split ends?Overall, this product is a must have to keep your hair healthy.  It will not work as a shine spray, or frizz remover,  etc..."
6650,Good_I really like this mascara; there is almost always a tube of it in my make up bag. Even when I deviate to another kind I end up coming back to this.
7572,"It's ok._I didn't get much volume, but the brush is small and you can get the inner corners more easily. The cat cap is a cute touch."
9988,"A little goes a long way and works fast!_I am in love with this eye cream. I like a cream that I can see it working fast. With this one, I could! In a matter of minutes I could see that my lines around my eyes were fading! Adovia out did them self on this product! Fan for life. The best part is it doesn;t take that much!"
9041,I am gonna throw my comb away!_This actually really works! This brush glides through my hair without getting so much hair pulled out like with my comb! My husband was very skeptical too but when he saw how much in ease I was while combing my wet hair he was also impressed. He is very much used to me combing my hair after washing it which can be kind of a hassle. I also love that the brush is formed &#34;ergonomically&#34;- it lays in my hand as if it is made for my hand and it is very light weight. I am gonna throw my comb away cause this brush is doing the job so much better! Love it and recommend it highly!
1934,"Good product_I like this highlighter.  I use it under my eyebrows, on the inside corner of my eye and the top of my cheekbone."
6647,Must have!_Any pro artist should have a belt/apron for their brushes! It's a total must have so your brushes are close at hand.  No more searching counter space for them.  Great price!
2971,"Love This Stuff..._I love this Pro X Deep Wrinkle Treatment. I use it on my laugh lines and my forehead lines, my laugh lines are almost gone in about a months time. Honestly its quite amazing. I have been using the Deep Wrinkle starter kit and to me this is the stand out product in that kit. No scent, a nice soft texture and a little bit goes a long way. DO NOT use it around your eyes it will dry out your delicate eye area skin and make you look like you have even more wrinkles. Guess thats why they have a separate eye cream lol."
8707,"AGED HAIR_SAW ON GMA, PURCHASED, USED OH MY. GREAT FOR MY HAIR I AM 52 I NEVER DIED MY HAIR, BUT TEXTURE CHANGES AND YOU WANT WHAT YOU WANT.LOL  I USE NEXXUS  SHAM/ COND THEN PUT IN LOREAL COMB 7 PUT A PLASTIC ON YOUR HAIR LONGER THAN RECCOMMENDED, HAIR FRIST, SHAVE,EXFOLIATE, ETC 20MINS LATER WOW SLIKY, BLOW DRY FLAT IRON IF YOU DO. I SMILE. ENJOY"
4762,"Abit too abrasive for dry or acne prone_I wish I could like this product more! It smells amazing and feels good, leaves my skin smooth - unfortunately I have acne prone skin that dries easily and this product is a little too abrasive for my skin, usually causing me to break out. I originally used it once a week and then once a month, I only use it now once in a while when I need a good strong face scrub and am prepared to deal with a breakout. It works good for d&eacute;collet&eacute; (chest/neck/shoulders) and over scars or stretch marks!"
9408,"It helps_I dye my own hair at home since it saves me a ton of money. Unfortunately it also damages my hair, imagine frizzy straw ya it gets that bad.So I thought Id give this product a try because it couldn't hurt right? Thankfully I was right I do notice a difference in the amount of frizz and it seems to be a lot smoother. It doesn't take much and because I don't wash my hair everyday ( as your not suppose to) it should last quiet a while.I'm sure we all know a girl or two that could benefit from this product I know I do. I like it enough to recommend it to others, and I'll probably be picking up a few as fillers for gifts."
2699,"Love this one the best._Personally I love this Vaseline Body Lotion the best out of the four that I have tried.  I love the fragrance which is light and refreshing and the way it makes my skin feel so much softer.  I do tend to go towards Aloe products mainly because my skin is more sensitive.  But all in all this one just has to get my top rating for it's non greasy feel, absorbution, fragrance and knowing that my skin is being pampered like a babies."
9396,"Everyone should use Vitamin C Serum_I received this as a complimentary item for review.  This is one beauty product that I will always keep in my makeup bag.  The clarifying properties of the C Serum are amazing. I've been using it on my face, neck, back and even underarms.  Within one week I saw a significant lightening of my underarms and the irritation I get from using antiperspirant was almost all gone.Mystelic is light and easy to apply. The dropper comes separate from the bottle and each is wrapped well for shipping.  I was surprised they sent it in a padded envelope but it made it ok.  Five drops is enough to cover my whole face, neck and back of neck.  Even such a little bottle will last quite a while."
4153,"Maintains my upper blepharoplasty_I love this product!  It is one of the best beauty products that I have ever used.  I had an upper blepharoplasty in the early 1990s.  I am 51 years old now, and my eyelids are still lifted.  I have been using this product for about 8 to 10 years.  It is inexpensive too!"
6118,"They were 'okay'_It's nice that you get a lot of multicolor rhinestones for such a low price, but they were not all that great in terms of quality. They stayed on for about a day or two. I wouldn't recommend it much because I don't even use them anymore. They're just waste of money. Better to have a professional put them on with their special equipments."
8886,Pretty color_Nice soft iridescent color.  Very pretty understated color.  Like it because it doesn't show the nail growth line as much as darker polishes.
1872,"Need to develop a liking!_I had heared a lot about the perfume on Amazon and so i decided to buy this at macys, since i dont like to get into anythin new, without the gurantee that i will like it and go thru the return hassles.Anyways, Its obviously pricey, but it does give a good smell. I agree with the previous reviewer, that the smell doesnt last that much though.The smell is not very light and so it is more of a winter wear than summer wear, but it is a classic smell, so it may not be appropriate for the young. I would recommend starting it sometimes after 35.On and on, not bad, but buying it again...............i will have second thoughts"
2361,"great for dry skin_This winter, my skin has gotten so dry and I had to buy a humidifier, products for my skin as it starting peeling and flaking. I always apply lotion when I shower everyday so I got a little frantic this winter. This is a a great product to use in the shower."
1185,"PEDICURE TOE SEPERATOR_Wow a 12 pack of toes seperator, I ordered them because of their purpose when painting your toe nails. The product is just as good as a person would find in a professional nail salon."
3948,"Perfect, except for the strong scent_I tend to be the sort of person who just buys the cheapest soap with the lightest scent available rather than try to find something with particular qualities. However, after using this soap, I may have to rethink that habit. This soap really does seem to leave skin feeling both clean (with no film left after rinsing) and quite soft. The claims on the back about containing 1/4 moisturizing cream appear to be quite true. Compared to the sometimes tight, post shower feel that I get with my usual choice of soap (generally the plain Kirkland brand at Costco), this is clearly a superior bar of soap.The only drawback to this soap is the scent, which is the usual strong smell for men's hair and body products. If it were a little less intense, it'd be okay, but it is so strong that the paper box the soap comes in reeks of it. If you're okay with the strong smell and you want something which leaves you very clean but still with soft skin, this is a pretty good choice which is several cuts above the cheap stuff."
5855,"Great Concealer_I have tried many, many, many concealers over the years and this is one of my favorites.  It covers great, but it is a little difficult to blend.  Since there are only a few colors to choose from, color matching can be difficult.  I recommend going to Sephora and getting a few samples to see what color you would need.  If you fall between, get two and blend the colors.  I prefer that method so I can adjust color depending on how much sun I have or have not gotten."
7019,"Great eye color_This is fantastic! Really smooth, great color, great price, long lasting. It can be used as a lip color too."
213,omg im in love_i love this thing!!! it makes perfect curls!! they arent tooo thick and i love it!!! so happy' its a great buy!
8287,"Suave Moroccan Infusion Color Care Shampoo - Great Product For The Price!_I am a regular consumer of Suave products - lotion, shampoos, conditioners and most of their health and beauty line.I wanted to try out Suave's version of the popular Moroccan Argan oil health and beauty movement. I have previously used Avon's 'Techniques' Moroccan line and Organix Moroccan line.Suave does measure up to Avon's line and is certainly priced better. The Suave shampoo has a wonderful clean scent and super rich lather.  I also use the conditioner that is in the same line.For the price, Suave's Moroccan shampoo is a good product and is very comparable to Avon's line that costs double."
904,"perfect_The product of this brand, I ordered a second time and I'm not disappointed. At first use I saw the result. My skin around the eye began as a child. This cream is very nourishing the skin. I'm 42 and I have one little wrinkle eye, which began to diminish. The skin around the eyes is more taut. I recommend to all."
1708,"Great Product_This scent smells amazing and is a great scent for the spring and summer. It is light, airy and refreshing."
6089,"gift_i bought this item as a gift and she loved it, or so she says. i dont use these types of things though."
5856,"Good Stuff_I recently started using this product about a week ago.  I have used the Olive Oil conditioning cream which works wonders on the ends of your hair but was constantly having to add it for constant moisture on the scalp.  This one, though not heavy at all, provides lasting moisture once applied to the scalp and brushed through.  No more popping and breaking of new growth when combing through my hair.  I love it.  My curls last and everything.  No weighted down feeling but lasting moisture which really helped the manageability of my hair.  I have relaxed, colored hair which is currently not in the best condition.  I will continue to use this as I believe it will also aid in the growth of my hair and the managing of my new growth in between relaxers.  Seems that this would be really good for anyone trying to transition from relaxed to natural.  I'm seriously thinking about it."
2103,"The best!_I used Perfect 10 4 or 5 years ago and stopped because it was hard to get a good choice of colors and tones in store. Recently, I tried a non-amonia &#34;natural hair color&#34; and turned yellowish with a dull texture in my hair. I'm 50 years old, I have very fine hair and if I want a little volume, I really need amonia in my hair color. This 010 Lightest Blond is perfect! 10 min and I'm a blond :) The texture of the hair mixture is not liquid, not too tick...just perfect. It gave me a very natural look, shiny hair and more volume. The price is great because in store, it turns around 11.99...when they have your #color. So, I hope Amazon will keep up with that brand and that shade of blond. I recommend it to those who want to be blond, but not yellow. It's not a ash, not a honey, not a golden blond: it's a natural blond."
1853,"Great stuff_I really love this stuff. I used it on my ears where I had some dry/flaky/itchy thing going on and it cleared up after one use. I use it all over my body, even my face. It works great on my dry & cracked heels. I have super sensitive skin that is prone to breaking out. The only problem is that I have used 1/2 of the jar in less than 2 weeks. I'm going to order the cheaper alternative Medicine Mamas Sweet Bee Magic to see if it works just as well."
522,Love It_Purchased as a gift for my niece at Christmas to use with the PYT flat iron - she is happy and says it works very well.
2673,i love this_i love how its sulfate free so it really cleans my hair and make my hair so easy to brush and so soft
2708,"Wonderful Body Wash_Although I like the pomegrante verbrena version by Dove best, I really love the necatrine and white ginger variant as well. The scent does linger on your skin a bit, leaving you smelling nicely in addition to have clean, moisturized skin. I get really dry feet and hands in the winter, where my skin cracks and chaffes, but this body wash has really kept that to the minimum this winter. It's a nice thick creamy substance too, and it lathers nicely. This is simply an excellent body wash in all regards. It smells nice and works extremely well. What more could you ask for?"
9732,"Smells lovely_Caress Bar Soap, Emerald Rush, 6 CountCaressThis smells lovely and lathers up nicely. Looks  pretty in the bathroom too. Will buy this again."
9843,"so far so good_I just received my Embellash. I applied it right away. No stinging, not sticky, goes on easily.  I have very thin brows and lashes and have taken before photos to publish comparison photos along the way.  I have wanted to do something about my lashes for  a long time and am looking forward to sharing the results.  I am an vitamin/herbal enthusiast and this product has a long list of wonderful ingredients, including herbs, amino acids, vitamins, to enhance the growth factor and improve over all health of lashes, brows and skin. It comes in a little pouch, which is a nice touch. Terrific customer service that stands behind Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Beauty products with a money back guarantee for 365 days. If for any reason you are not satisfied, you will immediately be issued  a full refund. No questions asked. Don't have to return. You risk nothing by buying Embellash. Very good price. Fast fast shipping.UPDATE:  I have been using my Embellash for a month.  I have to confess, I havn't been using it both morning as night as directed, sometimes I have forgotten to use it...BUT..even given my inconsistency, my lashes are thicker.  Before I started with this product, if I didnt have eyeliner on, my eyes had no darker distinction where the lashes are, very sparse and very pale. now, without eye makeup there is definitely a dark line.  I am encouraged to see the results now that I have committed to using day and night.."
5557,"Great for (Nail Art) Stamping_I have not tried this as a standalone polish, but purchased it specifically for stamping. It worked beautifully. The colour is vibrant and it dries quickly. Add topcoat and it lasts as long as your mani-pedi does."
8074,"Watts beauty moisturizing hyaluronic acid/vitamin C-L-Arginine_Ordered the product not knowing anything about it.  Loved what I read about the ratings. This was an excellent choice and excellent price.  I do get positve comments about my skin.  I use it on my face, neck, upper body.  I will continue to use."
1560,"Covers well at a good price._This is a great product, and being able to order it online makes my life more simple.  This product covers well, has a very light feel, and I never have to worry about touch ups.  Thank you."
6520,"I LOVE it!_Great Price! Great deal, great brushes! I Love it all. I just wish they had labels on them. But its okay I love it anyways!"
265,"Samoan Sand_I like this colour a lot in the pic. It's exactly the same colour as my skin, so it looks a little funny. I like it though."
2458,"Great if you have a steady hand_This is a really nice opaque black, and it goes on smoothly. If your hand shakes, though, you can really tell with a liquid liner, so be careful and rest your pinky finger/edge of your hand on your face as you work."
6787,"Great Stuff_Love the bronzer in this product. Will be purchasing more of this soon. I usually don't like bronzer, but this product has changed my mind."
3934,"Makes eyelashes fall out_I bought this several months ago, and although it does do a good job tinting the blond ends of my eyelashes, I think it also makes more of them fall out.  I have used this kit about 3 times, and after each time I have used it, many more eyelashes fall out than the norm, and this continues for weeks.  The darkening of my lashes is not worth losing my lashes, so this product is going in the garbage :(The fall out never happened when I got my eyelashes professionally tinted, so it must be this specific formula."
949,"Noticeably Firms Skin_Update: 4/22/2011When I tell people my age, they invariably say: 'You don't look that old.' I have to agree that at 43 I should be getting some wrinkles but nothing obvious has occurred. My skin is fairly sensitive and has combination skin problems. But when I use this creme as I have for years I must say that I'm impressed with the results. I also use this on my neck daily. However what I really love about this creme, besides the anti-aging effects, is that it is 100 % vegetarian and cruelty-free. I have tried many of the DermaE products and have found them all to be superior to anything I've ever used. I think the results are wonderful and the price is one I can afford. Use this along with Derma E Pycnogenol Eye Gel. It now comes in a handy tube instead of a jar.~The Rebecca Review"
7791,"I like it but dont love it_I bought this product after seeing a lot of reviews on it on YouTube.  I have to say I was surprised by the quality. I was using it all over my face until I noticed that it was causing me to break out. Im not exactly sure if it was caused by this product but I noticed after I stopped using it all over, the breakouts cleared up. I still use it almost daily as a setting powder to set my under eye Concealer. It set Benefits Boing Concealer amazingly. I would give this product a 4 out of 5 star rating. It's a bit pricey but worth it!  It helps to brighten my undereye area a lot. :)"
9246,"Impressive Hair Treatment Product!_First of all, I originally ordered this product because it is all natural. The vegan aspect made me even more interested in it initially. I was skeptical, as I would be with any hair growth product. I have only tried one other hair loss preventative and the results were close to non-existent. I am sold on this treatment though. I have seen noticeable growth and also am not seeing my hair in the shower like before. Just maintaining what I still have is great, but the new growth has impressed me so far. I am anxious to see the improvement over a year's time."
4931,"Very pleased_I use this in conjunction with a processing solution......that solution starts with a 't'.....tresso?.....something like that.  Anyway, I use the 9 neutral to lighten my hair a bit........I leave it on 7 minutes, don't use a plastic bonnet, apply it with a brush, start underneath and work my way up to the top........wash it out and Voila!  Then, a few days later I highlight my hair with Revlon's Frost and Glow......my hair looks professionally done and trust me......I'm no pro!"
2343,"Good Value_These are a very good value. Previous reviews stating these 'run large' are not exaggerating. Not only is the cap area large, but the elastic is also much looser than average size caps. I have a huge head and tons of hair and I still have to clip the caps in front to keep them from drooping down onto my face. They are plenty roomy enough to accommodate most big styles, afros, curlers, etc. But if I could change one thing it would be make the elastic a bit more snug so they don't slip down or gap open."
6513,"Not for dark hair_I bought this product despite the reviews because it was cheap and I wanted to try dry shampoo. I also bought the Dove dry shampoo at the same time.Good: not an overwhelming but pleasant odor. The texture of my hair was if I sprayed light hair spray on it. Got rid of all grease. Gave my hair body.Bad: I have medium brown hair. I followed the directions and sprayed my hair approx 8 inches away. I used very little and went on my hair white. I brushed it as recommended but it did not go away. It made my hair look white/gray and I was so embarrassed I had to wash it. I would not recommend this to anyone with dark hair. I am terribly disappointed, but for about $3 I guess I should have expected it.The Dove dry shampoo works much better and it's just a few dollars more."
5550,Smells great_I love the smell of this.  It was a gift for my 17 year old son at Christmas.  He and his friends all love it and he has to hide it to keep his friends from borrowing it.
2635,"Blendable, excellent sun protection_I am very pale, and there is skin cancer in my family. Until now I have mostly been an indoors person who used sunscreen when I knew I was going to get a lot of sun exposure. I recently adopted a lovely dog, and I have been walking him twice a day around our neighborhood. I didn't think I was getting enough sun exposure to warrant sunblock. When I started seeing tan lines, I knew I needed to take daily sun protection more seriously.I useNeutrogena Ultimate Sport Sunblock Spray, SPF 100+, 5 oz.for my body coverage. For my face, I decided that the low SPF in most facial moisturizers and makeup wasn't enough. When I read about the benefits of Mexoryl XL, I decided to take a chance on this product.I think the benefits of UVA & UVB protection far outweigh the drawbacks, but your mileage may vary. It does go on white, and you'll need to blend it well. I can see how this might look pasty on darker skins. If you're very pale like me, this won't be much of an issue. It is thick, but it's easy to massage it into your skin, and I have no trouble using makeup on top of it. I was expecting a hard, wax-like consistency, but that's simply not the case.I am acne prone, but this sunscreen doesn't aggravate the condition. It's not greasy at all, but I do feel like I have a coating of some sort on my face. Most other facial sunscreens get into my eyes somehow, but this one stays put.This sunscreen is protecting my skin from the sun very well, and it's a perfect fit for me. This product is hard to find, and costs more than other sunscreens, but I think it is worth every penny. This product is for anyone who is serious about sun protection and doesn't mind extra effort blending, or a possible white sheen on darker skins. For pale people, it's a must-have for summer."
556,perfect color_I bought this after trying a friends. Was looking for that perfect inbetween pink and peach and this was it! Looks great on sun kissed skin and just the right amount of coverage.
6947,"Smooth, clean primer that can save you $$$_For the price, this is a great primer.  Often, I use it alone without any foundation or powder because it leaves my skin looking so smooth and even.  Best of all, it saves me lots of $$$ because using this as a primer, I can spend less money on pigmented products like eyeshadows and blushes because there's no longer any need for the ultra-high-end products.  The less expensive pigmented products look fantastic as long as this is applied underneath."
736,"Would of given it a 5 star if the handle were more ergonomic_This thing is still great even though it has a kinda awkward handle, but that's what allows it to fold, so it is a necessary evil. Never had a device with a retractable cord work so well either. If you want a compact well drying hair dryer, this is a no brainer. I would definitely buy it again."
2623,"Tingly skin_When my face needs serious cleansing, because it's oily, dirty, or just feels blah, that's when I reach for this cleanser.  This is without question a cleanser with kick.  Mud-based, it's got mint essential oils which give it a tingly sensation on the face, along with some small bits that exfoliate gently.  I wet my face, and begin rubbing dabs of this on my skin.  You'll want to start with less than you think you need- the mint is soooo tingly that too much is not a good idea.  After putting it on I let it tingle for about 15 seconds, and then rinse off.  My skin feels very soft, cleansed, and the remnants of the mint tingle.  For those with dryer or sensitive skins, I wouldn't recommend this product.  It's what I use as my strong cleanser, and I have combination skin.  I can't use this every day, it's a bit too much.  For everyone else, though, it's great to have on hand when you want your skin to feel really, really clean."
1686,"LOVE Now Foods oils!_I ordered this and received the new white labeled bottle instead of the old design. Definitely NOT disappointed about that.Also, this is not just ylang ylang oil, but ylang ylang extra. I wasn't aware of that when ordering, but was very pleased upon its arrival! Ylang ylang extra specifically is from the FIRST collection of the essential oil during distillation, making it of the highest quality. Each respective extraction of the oil (there are four total) lessens in quality/scent, so the first has the strongest scent.Use less than you think you'll need, no matter what the application. This is strong stuff!I bought this for use in my homemade cosmetics and perfume, as well as aromatherapy. Fantastic oil, I couldn't be happier with my purchase."
2793,"Been lovin this product for years!_I have been using Aussie's 3 minute miracle on and off for many years now. I love it! I forgot about it for awhile, or they changed the packaging or something, but just recently found it again in stores and started using it on my highlighted hair.  Each time I use it its like I just stepped out of the salon with fresh highlights. I cannot believe how much it makes it shine and how it brings out the blonde.  I loved it so much, I tried using it daily, and it didn't seem to work as well,...like my hair got used to it. So, I settle for every other day or every 3rd day and it works very well.  Smells nice, hair is shiney, easy to comb thru, seems to have more body and bounce, holds curling iron better, and appears lighter in color.  Other conditioners make my highlights appear brassy or bronze in color which I hate.I love this stuff and I love the price! Hope they never stop making it."
9552,"Cleans Well, Smells Nice, Gel Formula_This is a great facial wash for men and teen's. It has a light masculine smell which does not hang around after it drys. Its a complete smooth gel - so no scrubbing particles that can be harsh on some skin. My son uses this product and washes his face either in the shower or with warm water in the sink. He likes the way it smells, how smooth it is and how nice it leaves his face - clean and dirt free. He is 14, and he does use it every day and it does help keep his face clean, and pimple free too. You can tell when he &#34;forgets&#34; to use it, as a few days go by and yes he does start to break out. My son is special needs, so things like creamers and smells are quite particular to him. Axe is one of his favorite products!"
7843,white perl nail art_i love them on my nailt and my phone cases great complements on both i will be ordering again soon
2232,Good Goop_This stuff keeps my hair in place which is what it's supposed to do. It won't be called on anytime soon to hold a radical style in place but does a good job with my fairly short hair.
5318,Always the best_A good buy because this is one of the best products around. Love my sunscreen from Trader Joes too. Can't get through summer without them!
6196,"LOVE IT!!!_This is amazing!  I have very thick color treated hair and have tried so many different products over the years.  This is one of the best!  After I wash my hair,  I spray this on and it detangles it...  It protects it from the heat of blow drying...  and it leaves my hair very soft, silky, and shiny.  I really love that it seems to continue to keep it from tangling.  My hair feels conditioned and healthy!  On tv I had heard one of Hollywoods famous hair stylists saying this is just the best hair product.  I'm so glad I was watching tv at that time or I might not have heard about it as soon as I did.  Highly recommend!"
2922,"Nice_Really good product, apples very nicely, it won't length you lashes dramatically however it is the cleaner mascara one will ever find.... Comes off nicely with warm water like plastic, leaving no residue on the face.... Good for the day time!!"
301,"Great coverage_Although i have very good skin, I have a birthmark on my face that I like to cover. I've been using Revlon Colorstay foundation for a decade and like it. Upon recommendation, I tried this and find that it covers better than any other products I've used. It's on the greasy side, so I wouldn't recommend it for oily skin type. It's definitely not a &#34;light&#34; make-up, so unless you really need the coverage, I wouldn't recommend it. If you need a good coverage, I can't think of a better coverage than this."
4911,"Just received it....:)_I was looking for a new fragrance to replace my usual Marc Jacobs. I love Marc but it is pricey. After reading reviews, I decided to order this. Reminds me of Michael Kors, not as heavy or cloying as MK. After a few hours I can still smell it on my wrists and it seems to drydown nice. True gardenia scent. Very inexpensive alternative to my usual. I hope it lasts a few more hours!"
6396,"Does it's job well_So far this is the best dry hairspray I have used.  I love the added texture it gives to day old limp hair, and it smells nicely as well.  My only complaint is unlike some other dry sprays I have used, if you don't watch how much you are layering on then it will leave a powdery white residue, kind of like baby powder, if over used.  I can only get away with using this on day old hair.  Not a multiple days use product."
1910,"Don't expect a lot of moisture from this product_I have &#34;mature&#34; skin and am always looking for a cleanser that is effective and yet won't dry out my skin even more. CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser is NOT it.I would give it a 2.5 for make-up removal and a 1 for hydration. I will stick with my favorite cleanser/moisture in one, Abolene. Why I even try other products is beyond me. I have learned, again, why I use Abolene (sold on Amazon).I couldn't possibly recommend this product to anyone with dry skin."
9442,"mixed results_I diligent ly used this for 5 days following the instructions.  I put this only on one leg and one arm so I could test if I could really see a difference.  I couldnt.  There was no visible change between my treated and untreated side.  However it seemed like maybe the skin was softer... but no one else thought so but me.  I still think that I can tell my skin is softer on the areas I used the lotion.After putting it on, I can smell a faint odor of it.  Its not exactly a perfum smell... not sure what it was....slighly reminicent of self tanner but not that strong.  If you shower again within 8 hours of application you can definitely tell you had put it on because the skin slicks up, as if the product was recently applied... so it does &#34;last&#34; all day when you apply it in the morning.I like it althouth my visible results were non existant.  I do think that my skin feels better.  I will keep using it... but I cant give it five stars."
8309,"Great for detangling hair_My hair often gets tangled and has a life of its own. This product smells amazing, you can smell all of the different oils in this product (mineral, coconut, almond, Argan). It is great to put on your hair and take a wide-tooth comb to untangle. My hair feels smoother and softer to the touch when I rinse my hair with water. It is also at a very affordable price ($2.88 at time of writing). You can't even get decent shampoo anymore at that price, so I do recommend this product. The only thing I would change is that I wish there was more Argan oil in this product, its practically the last thing on the ingredient list.With all of that said, If you want something to help you untangle, and will make your hair smoother, then this item is for you!"
6140,"Nice shape choices_Lots of choices for your nails and still a good deal, I'm fairly sure there is not 1200 in the pack but I like them."
7274,Very Nice_This color is very beautiful! Its a Navy Blue with blue sparkles in it that you can see in the sun
205,"Best creme_Sensitive skin is a problem. This product works well with no bad reactions. It has a faint smell, but that lessened after a couple weeks"
3206,"Smoothest skin ever_As someone who constantly exfoliates their face, this cloth is a clear must have. This has helped fade my acne scars and eliminate breakouts significantly. It also makes your skin unbelievably soft and has replaced all my facial exfoliant products."
7526,"Best ever!_For real the best top coat and quick dry ever! Even over foil, doesn't crinkle it. Shine for days over everything. Try it you'll never use anything else."
773,"Best Ever Body Wash_Having skin issues, I have found that this soap is the only one on the market that works for me. It goes on smoothe, no soapy residue and leaves my skin fresh feeling all day!"
3067,"Best Flat Iron EVER_This flat iron makes my hair look so soft and shiny! I had spiral curls in my hair the other day and decided I didn't like the way it looks so I got my new straightener out, it was like my hair was never curled!! I have already recommended this to all the women in my family and all my girlfriends! Also, you can't beat the price!!"
4961,"Fantastic brushes for a super low price_These brushes are fantastic and the set is sold at a super low price. They're on the same level as my MAC brushes, which I know if MAC sold them the set would be above $50 or even $100. I liked them so much I bought the eye brush set too. I could careless if they're eco-friendly, but I guess that's a bonus too."
2252,A favorite_I have always found this product in a tanning salon which I never tan but loved the product.  They no longer carry it and i found it here! Yay!!  Arrived on time and product is great!
4527,"I think it works but..._I must start by saying that even though I think it works, I will not be buying it again. First, it smells great. My skin does feel softer and there is a slight improvement although I cannot say it is because of this product alone as I have started working out and going thru a home-made organic juice fast at the same time (Look up 'Fat, sick and nearly dead' online).But the main reason I am not buying it again is the price. The product only lasted about 2 weeks and I used it mainly on my tights, buns and stomach and it is not like a have a lot of it either (I am a size 4) but I cannot see paying so much for something that will last only a couple of weeks.If you can afford it, go ahead and give it a try."
3048,"Great Flat Iron_I love this flat iron.  I transitioned to natural hair (no chemicals), but still need to straigthen my hair for job interviews etc,.  I have the CHI and paid about $100 for it and the Remington works much better.  Plus the Remington has a digital temperature reading so I don't burn my hair.  Unfortunately that's what happened with the CHI, resulting in me chopping off quite a few inches.  Also since the Remington has wides plates, it straightens my hair faster.  I love that it's ceramic and has Tourmaline.  The Remington S-9400 is just a great flat iron and the price make sit even better.  It's a great buy."
6964,"odd smell, but feels good_The only negative comment I have about this product is that it has a medicinal smell that some other wipes don't have. But the smell wasn't so strong as to make me not want to use the product. I did like the feel of this wipe better than others I have used. It left my skin feeling clean and 'light.' Some wipes I felt like I needed to rinse after--these I did not. They work great. The wipe itself is soft. I'm happy with this product and definitely recommend it."
986,exfoliates well_This mask does exfoliate well and really degreases my oily skin.  It dries in way under 10 minutes and is comfortable.  It is messy to take off so I take it off in the shower or I use a washcloth at the sink.  The product arrived promptly and in good condition.
4925,"Ahhh! Finally a solution!_I have heavily bleached, bright blue hair. As such, I try to avoid using heat on it. These are the perfect solution. The hook is easy to use, once you get the hang of it (google a few video how-tos). I personally use Beyond the Zone mousse to make the curls stay. My routine is to shower at night, half-dry my hair, then use the mousse one section at a time, and liberally (I have very thin hair). These are very easy to sleep in. Caveat- You may need to buy another pack for your hair, as one set is not enough to cover your whole head."
9440,"Subtle_To be honest, I'm not sure if this product is worth it. This shampoo-in stuff is supposed to help extend the life of color. I tend to have more problems with hair growth and obvious roots, but my color certainly fades some too, so I was hoping this could help restore some life. I used in the shower as directed, and I'm not sure that I'm really getting much for results. I think maybe I see some brightening, but it's hard to tell. In other words, there may be some slight results, but if so, they're so subtle that it's hard for me to say for certain. Given the subtlety, I can't say with honesty that it's worth the money. I was somewhat confused as to whether I was properly a cool blonde or a warm blonde (I tried both) and I can say that the results are subtle enough that it doesn't much matter if you choose one or the other.Note: I used both the Warm Blonde and Cool Blonde formulations, and had exactly the same results with both."
4185,Nice_Love this....works great and seems to be of great quality...would recommend it to my fellow nail techs. Be sure to look at the ends in the pic...was more curved then what I had seen but I actually liked it.
8207,"Pretty long extensions_It took very long to receive the extensions. The extension was very pretty. I love the one piece, easier to place on your hair."
2938,Quality and ORGANIC!_Exceptional quality - smells like fresh roses!Organic - roses are heavily sprayed with pesticides so organic is best.I use this for wiping my son and my eyes in the morning upon awakening - very refreshing.
9116,"These are AMAZEBALLS_I was looking for a cheaper alternative for beautyblender sponges because I wasn't prepared to spend $20 for 1 sponge, when I stumble over these sponges on amazon. I noticed the great reviews they get and decided why not. I must say that I'm blown away at how good these are for the price. I'm for sure will re order these. Thanks beautyjunkees"
7603,Love it!_Lip stains are the way to go for minimizing retouching. This stuff is low maintenance beauty. And the color is beautiful and flattering to many skin tones.
8443,"Smooths Things Out_My hair is thick and can get a bit out of hand if I neglect it much. This did a decent job of calming it down and smoothing things out. I liked that there wasn't a strong scent to it. It was a little floral, but not the kind of overwhelming smell that I'm still noticing long afterward like some products I've tried. I did have to be a bit careful to thoroughly rinse, but it wasn't anything too onerous.The bottle size might not stretch over very many treatments depending on how much hair you have, but given that I'm only going to be using it about once a week I think it'll be all right for how long it lasts."
347,"Evocative and bold_I've been wearing Pheromone on and off since its introduction and consider it my signature scent.  Unlike another reviewer, I find it fine for daytime, though I suppose it may depend on your personality.  I had a lot of attention from coworkers (men) when I was younger and wearing this.  As long as Marilyn keeps making it, I'll keep buying it!I don't see why it's considered light, floral and romantic, though.  I always think it smells like mystery and gold."
8648,"E.l.f. Nail polish_Although I'm not in love with every single color in the set, I really like most of them.  I like smaller nail polish bottles because I never manage to use a whole regular-sized bottle."
4264,"Tried and True_Been using this product at least 5 years, never found anything better. Use with Prime-Time is a must. Goes on very easily with the brush with excellent coverage of blemishes ranging from light spots to darker acne blemishes."
3222,Right of the shower brush!_Ive never been able to brush my hair after a shower with out leave in products but this actually works incredibly well!
1724,"Creamy and smooth_This mascara comes in a lovely medium brown color that would go perfectly with light brown and blonde hair. As advertised, it has none of the clumps that so many other mascaras have; it goes on smoothly and looks more natural than most.  I have found, though, that it's easy to end up with a drop or two of it on an eyelid or under the eye, so I work on trying not to blink too much when I'm applying it. Multiple applications stay clump free, and once dry, the mascara won't smudge. Also as advertised, it's easy to remove. I like the case too--it has a nice little mirror on the side that's perfect for lipstick application. Try it!"
2112,"HOOKED_I can't live without this suncreen.  Live at the ocean, was looking for a high SPF&lt; a tint &lt; and a good safety rating on EWG.org.This gives me all three and a beautiful mat coverage to wear either alone of under make-up.  A total winner!!"
1210,"Makes my hair feel amazing_I would have given this product 5 stars if it weren't for 2 things. One, its really expensive, and two, it solidifies if the temp. drops. It is also a little on the heavy side, so I'd recommend switching your shampoo if necessary, I have been using it with a clarifying shampoo and my hair feels like silk. One of the most amazing things about it is the way it smells, LUXURIOUS! I'm a dancer and when I let my hair down it smells wonderful and that makes me feel good, given that I'm usually sweaty after practice or workout. It has helped my hair stay super shiny and when I put it up in a bun, I add a few drops of this and it looks perfect. I have also used it to the beach and it protects the hair from water and salty mist. However, it is hard to apply, I wish it had a pump rather than you getting oil everywhere, because once its liquid its super slippery. I live in a place where temp stays on the mid-60's and this product solidifies, so I have to put it under hot water to be able to use it. I do not recommend microwaving oil, ever! It can over heat and cause burns and I think it also affects the compounds in it."
6730,"Expensive, but it works!_I've been on a mission to find a light lotion that would provide the right amount of moisture for my combination, acne-prone skin without leaving an oily residue or causing breakouts. After trying several different lotions, I think I've found a winner! Initially, I was nearly frightened away the price, which is kind of steep for a drugstore moisturizer, but I am glad that I gave it a try. It just melts right into my skin. In the two weeks that I've been using it, my skin tone has improved, and I'm getting fewer acne breakouts. I also like that there is no SPF to irritate my eye area. The fragrance (which smells like synthetic orange creamsicle) takes some getting used to, but otherwise, I love everything about this product. It might just become my holy grail lotion."
7462,Works great!_I don't have much to say about this product other than the fact that it works great as a conditioner. It conditions my hair and leaves it shiny and smooth. I can't say for sure that it is strengthening my hair because I already have fairly thick and strong hair but from a pure conditioning standpoint it is working great.
7573,Nice set_I really enjoyed all the different colors in this set. The only thing I would have to say about the product was that the glitter pieces were a little large so I would sometimes have a hard time manipulating it to look right on my fingernail tips.
5421,lotion_Very good lotion with bronzers and a light shimmer to it. Smells great before and even after tanning. recommended!! awesome!!
6335,"*2013 Newest LED Models* USpicy SAVARIN USND-1201 12W LED Nail Polish Dryer... does great._I did my first Gelish nails and used the USpicy. It worked great. I dried each application 2 minutes. I also applied the alcohol wipe after each application. I used the Gelish foundation, my regular nail polish, then the Gelish top coat. The Gelish polish is rather thick. I placed all polish in a very warm water bath before use. This will thin it down. All applications were as thin as possible. One coat of foundation, two of polish, and two of topcoat. Super shine and strong nails."
872,"Classic fragrance but not for everyone!_When I first applied Cabochard, I had a what-the-heck reaction. What was everyone thinking? Herbs & citrus was not what I was expecting from this revered leather. Thankfully I waited, patiently waited. It was an hour before Cabochard began to peel back its layers. First, the beautiful floral heart that is not overtly femme. Then, a smoky, dry strapping leather to rave about. Later, almost a worn & loved suede jacket. It's love.I'm uncertain how wearable Cabochard is for me because it hasn't passed the DH (darling husband) test. However, I now have an appreciation for this new-found classic, and I better understand where citrus-leathers (like the lighter & well-done Cerruti Image Woman) may have got inspiration."
6128,"So cheap & fell apart!_I don't know HOW this product got so many good reviews?? The ball point tip of the dotting tool broke off just when I took the plastic off of it. So mad and it only came with one! After the first use of 3 of the brushes, the bristles came apart and they were completely worthless to try and use again. I've tried everything to take care of them, but you get what you pay for I guess. In the TRASH is where they went! NOW I'm on the hunt for QUALITY Professional brushes!"
495,Love this bouncy creme_I use this in combo with my hair gel and never have frizz and my hair is easy to comb through when wet! I've been using this now for years.
5063,Love it!_Feels fantastic on my eyes.  I can see a difference in eyes not looking as tired as they did before I started using this cream.
2727,"DO NOT BUY!!!! horrible!!!_OMG... this is horrible!!!! My baby doesnt have a sensitive skin... but when I put this on her face... OMG she broke out so much, received the worst rash I have ever seen! How is this possible and what in the world is in this thing... shouldnt this be sensitive towards a babys skin? What toxins are in there? Horrible. I felt so bad for my baby. Will send it back for sure- the company should definitley look into this...this shouldnt be happening. Will not purchase and not recommend to anyone."
3918,"NYX Red Cheeks cream blush review -5 stars!_This has become the #1 used blush in my makeup stash! (& I have A LOT lol ;D)I have 30yr old, very fair, warm toned skin for reference, but think that this blush is great for any season, outfit, OR skintone! It's cream, not powder & quite pigmented, so it's imparitive to use a light hand w/this or you *will* get the 'clown cheeks' look ;D Lol!For application I like to use a wedge sponge or a dense fndtn brush, then blend out with fingers or sponge. It's the perfect 'in from the cold, I'm naturally blushing' look, which is the look I prefer on a daily basis b/c I like to play up my eyes and/or lips. I highly reccomend this & will continue to repurchase :)The only issue I have is the way that Amazon packaged it to send me.. I clicked the option to 'send all of my items at once' but they decided to package this blush (and ONLY this blush)separately...It arrived alone in the largest possible size yellow envelope, w/no bubble wrap! Needless to say the lid was cracked&broken; in 3 different places & I had to pick pieces of plastic out of my cream blush :( I was able to tape it all back together but it's very flimsy now & I cant carry it in my purse or the peices of plastic get all through my product again...VERY DISAPPOINTING AMAZON!! I did leave Amazon.com negative 'packaging feedback' but didn't ask for a refund or replacement bc this was only $6. Had it been more expensive this would have been a *BIG* problem.. &I; will think twice before ordering cosmetics from Amazon again which is unfortunate b/c NYX products aren't available in my area which is why I purchased from here in the 1st place.. -This is just a friendly warning..If *YOU* are thinking of ordering this blush from Amazon, I'd definately call the 800# & politely ask that they bubble wrap this before sending :)Otherwise, I do very much *LOVE* this blush!! :D"
4256,"Heavy_The quality of materials is good, but for regular use it's kind of a hassle. I'm pretty sure it's heavier than my head. Ok, maybe not, but it's big and heavy and seems to get in the way whenever I use it. It seals fine and keeps my hair perfectly dry in the shower. It does tend to slip down to my eyebrows and over half my face, but hey my hair is dry. Kinda regret paying so much for a shower cap. I didn't want to create waste by using a bunch of the cheap drugstore shower caps, but I might end up doing that anyway."
7821,yes_Paid  a little more from the company and this was  a little dry but  I am happy with it and glad to have gotten it
1717,"AWESOME_My hands feel amazing and it's not greasy or overly scented - my go to hand lotion!! Love nivea cream, but it's too greasy for hands during the day, so I use this instead!"
242,Natural_These lashes look very natural. No dramatics at all. Great for daytime looks. I have very light lashes and these give me the lashes without anyone knowing I have false lashes on.
8547,"Wonderful cleaner!_I gave this as a gift to my wife.  Not that she needs to look younger or anything.  She's quite beautiful really but she said she wanted it so who am I to argue.  So, I suppose it works great since she looks amazing."
606,"Smoother & Younger! I'm in!_This moisturizer is awesome! It makes my skin extremely soft and I swear it looks fresher and younger looking when I wake up in the morning. It smells great and Oil of Olay makes amazing products at affordable prices. Buy this, you won't regret it :)"
7510,"Solid Comb_Nice comb for on the go. Solid in quality. Perfect fit everywhere gym, car, back pocket etc. Nice feel. Good price for comb."
9371,"Vitamin C Serum that Helps my Hyper-Pigmentation and Evens Out my Skintone!_First Impressions...I had received a bottle of Vitamin C Serum to review a few months ago, but was required to write a review on my first impression of the product and wasn't really given enough time to give you my thoughts after using it for several weeks. So I was very happy when I was given another opportunity to review this type of product, this time with Pure Body Naturals. Their Vitamin C Serum sells on Amazon for $29.95 , which on first impression may seems kind of pricey. But I've had my bottle for almost a month now, and it still has a lot left. You only use a little bit at a time, so this product does -- in my opinion -- end up being well worth the money you spend.Packaging...Pure Body Natural's Vitamin C Serum is packaged in a really cute dark-glass bottle with a white dropper used to get the product out. It has a purple label with the outline of a lady on it (which will appeal to us women! ;-). I really liked the packaging and have no complaints with the method they give you to use the serum. It works well!Product & Application...I began using this in my skin care routine at night. After I've taken off my makeup and washed my face -- and before I apply moisturizer -- I will take half a dropper's amount onto my fingers and then just pat it into my skin. It dries really fast, so I don't have to wait long before I can apply my moisturizer and hope into bed. :-) The serum is a murky-clear color and there is no distinct smell to this product, that I can tell. All around, applies very effectively!Results Over Time...I've been using this for over 3 weeks now, and while the hyper-pigmentation on my face hasn't totally disappeared, I can definitely see a difference! The dark spots left from my acne are very faded and the overall appearance of my face looks more smooth and even-toned. No complaints from me -- only praise!Final Thoughts...It's a wonderful product! I really do think that the benefits of applying all these vitamins onto your skin helps the cells regenerate itself and give you a more healthy glow to your face. I'd never tried any serum's on my face before using Pure Body Natural's Vitamin C Serum, and after experiencing the benefits of vitamin C, I think I'll be sticking to this product for the long run! I am really, extremely happy with the results from adding Vitamin C Serum to my skincare regimen!I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers."
7594,"Gorgeous color!_I love purple-ish lipsticks, and this is just a beautiful shade of purple with hot pink. It reminds me of the Lancome Rouge in Love lipstick in Violette Coquette."
5954,"Smells good_The smell is good and it lasts a long time, but it seems to make my hair fall out more."
6383,"Excelent_I like everything about this brush! Its perfect for apply shadow under your water line!! I recommend it 100%, perfect performance! I love it!!"
3602,ONE OF PROACTIV'S BEST PRODUCTS!_I PUT THIS CREAM ON NIGHTLY AND HAVE NOTICED MY SKIN TO BE CLEARER AND MORE EVEN TONED. THE SMELL IS VERY REFRESHING AND THE CREAM IS LIGHTWEIGHT. A WIN WIN!
120,"Good mask_i went to the drugstore looking for queen helene's mint julep mask, but i couldn't find it, so i picked this up instead. i really like this mask as well, it leaves my skin feeling really clean and soft and it's very easy to rinse off. i have sensitive skin and i haven't had any breakouts or adverse reactions to it after using it. the only things i don't like about it are that it makes my eyes burn a lot if i put too much of the product around them, and it's a little itchy when it dries."
506,"So natural I forgot I was wearing it!_I had to come and write a review right now because I purchased this product yesterday and am wearing it today for the first time with a new lip gloss.  All morning I have been at my desk obsessively sneaking peeks at a compact mirror to decide if I like the lip gloss.  But the tinted moisturizer blended so seemlessly into my skin I forgot I was wearing it until just now! Even with all that mirror time, I did not notice the makeup on my skin!I am all about sheer coverage.  I have reasonably decent skin but have some freckles and uneven color tone from the first signs of aging.  So I just need something minimal to even me out and give me a more polished look.  But I hate, hate, HATE to see or feel makeup on my skin.  I've never understood people who wear visible foundation or powder - it looks awful!  Also, men really hate it - I don't know if you know that, ladies!  But sometimes you need a little bit of coverage, and this product is perfect!  My skin is very sensitive and claustrophobic (not kidding) and normal foundation and powder literally make me itch.  My skin feels 'dirty' if I can feel the product sitting on top of it- I just want to go wash it off.  But I have had this on all morning and don't feel that way at all!  It provides just enough SHEER coverage. I think I may have found the perfect product for me.If you have more skin issues and need/prefer heavier coverage this might not be for you.  It's not foundation. But if your skin just needs a little even-ing out and you don't want to feel or see your makeup on top of your skin, this stuff is perfect!"
4698,"one of the best Vit C product on the market_Remember you need Vit E to absorb the Vit C  in your skin.  So do not waste your money on Vit C products that simply sit on the top of your skin and do nothing.  This is an amazing product.  It will protect you from free radical damage...sun, enviromental stuff etc.  That is the reason why you need a Vit C product for you skin  every day.  Here is the recipe for beautiful skin:1)Lumixyl topical brightening cream2) SkinMedica Vit C +E complex3)SkinMedica TNS Essential Serum4)Neocutis Biorestorative Cream with Psp5)Neocutis lumiere Riche Biorestorative eye balm with Psp6) sun Block"
5699,STYLISH_It WORKS...it holds my curls doesn't really tame my frizz but does wonders to my hair..like keeps my curls there gives a good hold without being hard textured..
510,light_It's light and gives the right amount of weight to my hair. It is a great leave in conditioner for my natural hair.
1300,"Excellent Liquid Highlighter_Such a lovely liquid highlighter. The color is a warm, champagne nude with the finest shimmers. It blends into my medium skin-tone easily and gives it such a pretty sheen. Oily skinned people may want to set it with a setting spray to keep it lasting longer. I like to use it on the &#34;outer C&#34; of my cheekbones/temple, the bridge of my nose, cupid's bow, and inner corners of my eyes. It makes my skin look so healthy and smooth, without looking like I have glitter sitting on my face. It does not break me out either (keep in mind that this is not an oil-free highlighter). The only &#34;con&#34; for me is the pump it comes with. It's very easy to pump out too much product if you only want to use it sparingly. I can't believe I found this on Amazon for less than $30. It typically sells at Sephora/Nordstrom for over $40. Beautiful, beautiful highlighter."
8703,"It works._This product does what it promises. I live in a very dry climate and right now it's dry skin weather. I used these for a week before writing this review and I can honestly say, those little dry white flakes on my skin disappeared. Do they give me a healthy glow? Hard to say. I'm not sure how I look when I glow. But my skin looks healthy.You wouldn't know they had mango in them though. There is no scent--as stated on the packaging, but I was somewhat surprised. I expected there to be something mangoy about the wipes. One of the reasons I picked them was the 'mango extract.'If I compare these to Pond's though, I have to say Pond's is my favorite brand of face wipes. They offer a better variety of scents and exfoliatations."
2955,shany_Hello I very much liked the brushes they were soft and very pretty; I love pink and black. It was great for my face especially since I have bad acne.
8033,Good deal_Well worth the money. At Christmas time I bought this as a small gift to go with another one and it made such a big difference.
4489,"Easy and effective_This alpha/beta peel works just as described, and it's so easy to use you won't need to pay hundreds of dollars for facials at spas again.  I use this once a week, and it helps to clarify and exfoliate my skin.  I really do notice a difference in texture and clarity after I began using this product.  It's an easy, two-step process that takes about three minutes (two minutes for the first step, one for the second), and I highly recommend this peel for easy and effective skin cell turnover."
7119,"Yuck_I tried this because I was trying be a bit more environmentally friendly and avoid using the aerosol can of dry shampoo I currently had (and loved). Well, this stuff was gross. I've tried it all different ways and it just leaves my hair oily and unmanageable. Back to the aerosol."
349,Roux Temporary Haircolor Touch-Up Stick Med Brown_Gifted this to my aunt. She likes it and says that this is a great temporary solution to touch up the roots (and cover up the grey) between color appointments.
805,Excellnet gift idea!_Purchased this as a gift for my sister. She loved the fragrance and said it was now her favorite.  The price was way lower than I owuld have paid elsewhere!
7850,great product_great product.....  just as described and i thought they were a bit pricey but they are not cheap quality so i think its good.....
5821,"ITS MY FACE TONER, FACE PICK ME UP SPRAY & DEFINES MY CURLS AND MAKES HAIR EVEN SOFTER!_I'VE been using only Wen products for 5 years and this 12oz is only available on QVC in a TSV kit or specials they have that sell out immediately! I cannot and will not live with this product!! I use it after cleansing, putting my Wen leave in and styling cream in. It makes your hair even softer, defines curls Luke no other product I used before starting Wen and I carry a 2oz bottle in my purse to spray on my face as a pick me up refresher and I use it as my face toner and it leaves your skin clean, soft and moisturized!!

5711,great color this is a must have polish_love the color. must put multiple coats though. overall I love this brand. Will recommend to anyone that loves the natural look
8254,"JUNK!!!!_I bought this product back in November of last year, so I decide to use it today  for the very first time, and I was so disappointedthis mess beaded up like crumbs...so I dipped again in the  acrylic liquid to make should that I was not doing something wrong,but guest what, the same thing happen again, and it was like `rubber it didn't get hard at all . THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!  good I had backup. And if I could give them a zero than I would, because that is how bad this stuff is.  You ask why am I just using this product, well you see, a friend bought me over $300.00 worth of difference products for my nails so that is why I am just getting to this one... I decide I wanted to wear pink and white nails for church Sunday, but I had to use my regular white tip and I put some blue gem stones on them they are beautiful. I wish I could add an attachment for you to see them. I save so much money by doing my nails myself, so I don't need bad PRODUCT. Thank you. Hope this help you on buying this product. Oh yeah I forgot all the junk products have difference names on them I didn't know that until today. I wish I could send this mess back.I pray I don't have any problems with my other products."
245,Cheaper than the name brands but works the same!~_Cheaper than the name brands but works the same!~Star Nail Pen-Style Polish Corrector...arrived super fast and a lot less expensive than the Cutex brand!~ I recommend these!~
2473,"Amazing!_I was initially disappointed when I opened the package ... the tool didn't have as much substance as some of the other buffers I've used.  I gave it try anyway and just like the other reviewer stated, I can't believe how shiney my nails are after less than two minutes of buffing.  There's no instructions, but you start with the darker colored side and work your way down to the lighter color.  I'm glad I bought extras to give as gifts."
2739,"Excellent make-Up  Brush Set :: Eco Tools ::_Wow, I am very happy with this set , the first thing , the brushes are a high quality not lose any hair , soft but excellent for my liquid make up , I think it was made for liquid and not mineral make up as mineral make up need more harder brushes, however it does the job wonderful , I use one of them for the powder and blush and also the other for eye shadows and canceler , this is so far my best brush set for so low price I ever purchased .P.S I used the big brush for the mineral powder and made a nice job , you will not be disappointed from the great quality ."
2219,"Shalimar by Guerlain for Women. Eau De Cologne Spray 2,5 Oz._Shalimar By Guerlain For Women. Eau De Cologne Spray, is one of the most wonderful fragrances ever created. It blends with ones' own body chemistry and produces on the individual wearer, a uniquely personal and beautiful fragrance. I have worn Shalimar  for years and have had so many compliments on it.

6198,"Best leave in treatment for dry, damaged hair._My poor hair is dyed and heat styled all the time. This product truly helps to counteract the damage. It is a bit heavy but not so much so that is weighs my hair down too much.  Really strengthens and protects my hair. Love this stuff!"
5875,"Interesting_Great to have. There's a long thin brush attached to the cap like those liquid eyeliner bottles. I have to apply more then a thin layer to the false lashes I'm using in order for it to stay on. The color black matches with the eyelash color as well as my black eyeliner.For the clear/white eyelash & double eyelid glue: If you want a double eyelid look, it's better to use the clear/white glue because it makes the double eyelid look more natural."
3929,"This stuff is AWESOME!!!_My hair is dry, and frizzy, if I don't put leave in conditioner in. So I sometimes have to put two different types, there are a few that I don't have to use only one, this is one of them. And I love that your protected from the outside elements. There are only certain products that I plan on continuing to use, this and anything with argan oils, of course everything has cones in it, but I'm used to it. I have long hair that's a little past my waist, I'm working on almost tailbone length hair. And this stuff will help!Update: I just cut all the damage off my hair from not using heat protectant, which I learned about after I damaged it, my friend never used it when she straighten her already straight hair. I have hair to my bra line and bangs, my bangs had to be cut after a year of the same length from all the damage. I don't look good with bangs. Anyways I'm going to try this stuff out again. And maybe they'll come out with a cone free version or maybe they have one out already? I'm planning on going cone free, I have wavy curly hair. I'll update later one."
2411,overall pretty good_you do have to be careful to not scratch your nail with this. Just keep it at a low angle.
1991,"Works OK_This stuff works pretty well. It's got a great scent and texture.  It goes on easily, but does take a little work to get it completely out.  I am not the target demographic for this product (I'm white), but I do have VERY long and thick hair that often needs treatment, especially in the winter time. I used about half of the recommended amount and then followed the rest of directions. It left my hair clean and sleek, but the next day I was SUPER greasy. Overall, it's a decent product, but I would guess it works better on hair for their target audience."
279,"Nail stregthener_The nail stregthener is suppose to be clear, mine has a yellow tint to it. Unfortunally I accidently throw away the returning label or else I would have returned it to the seller. I am sure the product is great but like I said my has a visible yellow tint to it. Also, it tinited my nails yellow. Seller look into why the product has yellow tint to it."
3910,"Too dark :(_I have light/fair skin, but my hair is dark dark brown and so are my (thin) eyebrows. I love that it's retractable and has a soft brush to blend in for a more natural look, but it's way too dark! I should have used a rule of thumb and gone two shades lighter than my hair color. I should say that I went running with it on and although some of it rubbed off it never smudged outside of it's area (like how eyeliner does). I would buy this brand again, but just not this color."
6443,pretty in pink_I have bought a nail stamping kit that comes with the scrapper being metel in the end. The metal caused my plates to sratch the designs so I have been searching for one that is all plastic and wont mess up my beautiful image plates this seems like the one. I havent ordered yet but just wanted to share with everyone that if this is going to be the first time they buy a set like this plastic scapers and better then the metal ones for this.
2577,good product_Have been using this for years. Used to put it on at night. Now use it in morning under sunscreen. Much better results.
1688,"Leaves my hair soft, sleek and bright..._After all the good reviews I read on this, I decided to give it a shot.First, it comes in a really cute bottle, and it's not too big or clunky, and I like how it's transparent.It leaves my hair looking really nourished and healthy, and makes it softer than normal.  I also experience a lot less frizzy hair throughout the day.  It also brings out the blonde in my hair and makes my hair look bright and sleek.This stuff just feels so great in your hair, and I use it every day!  It's a definite hair serum must-buy."
3434,"Smooth_This is a nice, light product that is very effective!  It is gently scented so it does not interfere with perfume or cologne.  It is absorbed quickly and leaves skin smooth and supple-feeling.  I really like it.  Not sure about the anti-aging factor but I do recommend it's immediate impact."
7982,This is a regular purchase!_I purchase this regularly now. I can't be without it. I add it to other products and use it on it's own. This product has more benefits that can be listed and I particularly like this company.
8479,"Great holding power and smells good too!_So I have relatively short, medium thick, straight hair and the Axe Spiking Glue Spiked Up Look, 3.2 Ounce worked pretty well. You're not supposed to use a lot of it and doesn't leave your hair shiny or wet. It's not greasy and doesn't get rock hard when it dries.So overall it works well, there's a generous quantity in the tube given how little is used each time and it smells great."
6403,"shocking quality for the price_Honestly, this is better than my MAC blush brush.  It is much softer and gives a very nicely diffused blush application.  I also paid less than half the price for this one.  I'll be back for more Sigma face brushes."
760,Four Stars_Really good for skin after a day in the sun.
826,"Always noticed_I've worn this on and off for about a year, and every time I wear it I get comments from total strangers about how much they like it. I love it because it doesn't clog up my head with its potency; it smells light and pleasant."
1003,"Hair godsend from Conair! :)_Two words: this dryer plus the pro styler flattening iron and brush all in one equals: Own them! I was due for a hair wash when this dryer arrived to my house yesterday. After washing my hair and of course applying the proper heat protection (Keratin Oil before blow drying and Olive Oil heat protection serum after blow drying), This dryer does the job of a salon style blow out and in under an hour!When beginning the process, I separated my hair as I do when I am going to flatten it out using my prostyler straightener and ran the blow dryer comb attachment through only two times on the low heat setting. The low setting was all I needed while the comb attachment was vertical and glided through my hair with ease on tension setting 4. :) Just like when my stylist does it, my hair came straight with ease and looked like a salon style blow out only without the salon price tag lol!All I can say is, if you're an African american woman with hard to manage hair like mine, you have to own this and the prostyler straightener and your hair troubles are over! :) Just make sure to get the proper heat protection before doing any of this so to protect your hair from the heat. After that, your hair will be hair everyone else will want to have :DTotal time using both tools: 25-30 minutes tops. Yes I timed it! :D"
3314,"&lt;3_Love it, looks like the same color and looks shinny and my lips look plump :) but then again I have plump lips to begin with lol"
5928,Great Oil_I use this mixed with my regular body moisturizer during the winter.  My skin has never been better.  I would definitely buy this again and will continue to use it during the cold winter months.
1874,"OMG - Awesome_A little pricey - but worth every penny not to smell like a - well, you know.  I discovered this at the beauty salon in one of those foldouts in  magazine - and first sent off on e-bay for a small sample.  Loved it so much I came here and bought the full size.  Good perfume that matches your body chemistry is hard to find!"
7340,Love my purchase!_It came before it was supposed to and the images are crisp and clear. Can't wait to use it and do my daughters Mani/Pedi's!!Love hello kitty and this was a great price and I would highly recommend to my family and friends. I will purchase from this seller!!!
5738,"I love it_This is one of the first Real Technique brushes I purchased and what began my love for this brand. This brush is amazing quality and is so soft! It applies my foundation so easily and gives my face a flawless complextion. Seriously! This is the best foundation brush I have used to date, and I have tried a lot ranging from really cheap, to really expensive high end brushes. It's very easy to clean and maintains it's shape which has been a real problem for me with other brushes purchased in the past. This brush dries quickly too - I leave this to air dry and it's good to use again within 2-3 hours. Excellent buy - I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this brush to others and the complete Real Techniques range."
7170,It's WEN!!!_WEN is such an amazing product! I don't know what hasn't already been said about it. My hair is in love with it. This item was promptly received in excellent condition. :o)
8816,"Amazing!_This is the second tube I have ordered.  I first bought this and tried it because I had heard so much about BB cream and how good they are.  I am always hesitant to use moisturizer or sunscreen because I already have oily prone skin.  This stuff is very thin liquid..thinner than I thought it would be. But it goes on AMAZING.  It is completely non greasy and soaks right into your skin very easily.  It is very nice and matte finish, which is very hard for me to find in a foundation.  I feel like I am getting decent coverage without using a thick foundation.  Also, most foundations give me oily skin as the day progresses, but this stuff helps my skin stay non-oily.  I am very impressed by this product.  And this also lasts a long time. One tube lasted me months"
5733,"Big, fluffy & soft!_I purchased this brush for $2. I received it today and the brush is incredibly soft! High quality product for less. Can't wait to use it. :-)"
7037,Love this stuff!_I use it several time a week. I like the results and it does not take but a few drops per use.
8959,"From time to time,_From time to time I find a product that does what it should. First thing that struck me was the smell, neither masculine nor feminine, great. Skin was noticeably less dry in a few days. I wish I was doing the review in the winter when we here in Delaware all get dry skin from the heater running all day. I will try to update the review next winter, we will keep using this for sure."
3591,"Works so well_I love Special Effects. It has major staying power, and is so bright and vibrant. My girls both love having bright colored hair, and it stays even through multiple pool visits."
6680,"Hives_If you have sensitive skin, this is not for you.Within about 36 hours, every part of my skin that had contact with this lotion broke out with hives.I am going crazy.I have sensitive skin, and eczema. However, of all the lotions and sun screens I have ever used, none have given me such a reaction.I can barely function right now. My entire arms and legs are covered with red, small swellings of bumps, and itching like crazy.I've tried washing with mild soap and lukewarm water, taken antihistamine, and 1% hydrocortisone cream to no avail.Don't buy this if you have sensitive skin. I'm just thankful I didn't put any more of this anywhere else - I am already losing my mind.It has been over two days of itching.I'm going in to see my doctor first thing Monday...Update on June 24, 2013: took me 2 weeks of oral steroid prescription pills to begin the healing process. After 2 months the itching had finally become not so bothersome. Thank you for those passing concerns my way."
7863,Cute_I loved these bows they are so cute and perfect for when i go get my nails done. I can use one or two for each hand. I would definetly buy again.
6138,"Satisfied!_This actually came a week and a half earlier than expected, which certainly made my day! Some of the shapes will take some extra creativity to think of designs and others I'm already coming up with ideas instantly. There aren't any round rhinestones in this pack which is ok because this isn't the only rhinestone pack I ordered and for the price compared to going to a local beauty store, I'm definitely not going to complain. Can't wait to play with my nails!"
5256,"This Stuff is Amazing!_I stumbled across this brand here on Amazon and decided to try a few of their products. I have had health issues for the last few years, which have caused hormonal imbalances with my skin and its overall appearance. I have tried many high dollar products on the market, and none of them have worked. I saw that this was a vegan product, (I myself am a happy carnivore), and thought I'd give it a whirl. I'm so glad I did because this stuff is great!I was a little disappointed upon opening the product, as a good deal had leaked out, but I will definitely be ordering it again. I have used this in conjunction with 2 of their other products, and my skin looks great. It has drawn out so many of the impurities, and literally shrunk my pores. I can honestly say this is the best stuff I have ever used for skin care, and I will not be using anything else. I truly recommend this brand!"
9256,"Liquid Basic starter Kit Acrtlic powder Brush for 3D nails_got this for the grand daughter and she is loving it, just learning the art."
3189,"My Second Choice for a Leave-In Treatment_I have long (a little past mid-back) hair. Very curly, full of loose curls, wild twists, and tight, bouncy corkscrews. And it's pretty thick and fluffy textured (think Rogue from the 1992 X-Men cartoon and that's basically my hair). About a 3A/3B cusp. As such, I'm prone to split ends and tangles. This is my favourite leave-in after Curl Junkie's Beauticurls leave-in conditioner. It's easy to use. Simply spray it into wet or damp hair and gently comb it through. My hair is definitely softer after using it, and has very few split ends (the smell I also like and don't find it repellent)."
4810,Great_I really like the size of this bottle of perfume.I love the way it smell.Ladies this is a must have trust me you are going to love it.
9761,Great!_This serum works great! It makes my skin look great! I highly recommend this item! You will love it too!
5676,"Soft, Silky, Straight!_What I love about this is that is comes with temperature settings. I'm not big into beauty products, and the instructions didn't explain to me how to use the settings, but it was quite easy to figure out. Fine hair probably only needs the lowest setting, while thicker, harder to curl hair will need a higher setting. I have medium hair, the ends are a bit dry after years of dying my hair (but finally back to my natural color!). Because the ends are dry, I rarely used my old flat iron. It was a cheap-o and I know how much damage flat irons can do.I was totally excited I had the opportunity to get this iron. The first day I used it, I used it after washing and blow drying my hair. I used the lowest temperature setting because I already used a brush to straighten my hair and needed only to use the iron to make it sleek. Wow. It totally left my hair sleek and shiny and my usually dry ends looked great. The next day, I woke up and as usual, my hair had lost a bit of the sleekness and my natural wave came back. So I used the medium setting to straighten the curl and again, it left my hair silky and soft (and straight!). The temperature setting starts at 160 then goes to 230,300,370,and 410.It heats up SUPER fast. Within about 2 minutes. When you turn it on, a blue light blinks until the temperature you dialed is reached.There is a comfort grip on each side for your fingers and on each side of the iron, there are raised bars so you can place it on the counter/dresser without worry about it burning the counter/dresser.I feel comfortable I can use this on a daily basis without worrying about drying out my hair."
2074,Amazing!!!!_First of all: I LOVE the Korres line. This particular Facial Gel has a pleasant scent to it and it lathers nicely but not too much. You do not need a lot of product for each use so it will last a long time as well. It is also moisturizing too. My skin is combination skin and this cleanser is perfect for me because it moisturizes my dry areas and is not too moisturizing for my oily areas. I'm so pleased!
7358,ok_Love tjis product I use it a lot so no complaints would recommend this to someone else who needs one
2502,"If you have thick hair, you must try this......_Best product for my hair. I have very thick 3c, 3b and a little 4a hair so finding something that I can comb through my hair smaoothly without hassle is a big job. I am African American and recently had a ancestor dna test done and found out that I am sub Saharan( near Egypt and Moroccan part of Africa) European and Asian-answers a lot of questions about my hair, but also makes it harder to be natural and really hard to find good products for my hair. It is easy to find this product on amazon, but it cost a lot more on amazon so do your research. Once you try it, you will be hooked."
4599,love_love the smell and aroma and the bottle is a great decorative item on my dresser andit is great priced and packages right
7762,Excellent_GREAT PIGMENTACION GREAT COLORS GREAT PRICE PROFESIONAL LOOK I ADORE IT THISEYESHADOW PALETTE HAS ALL THE INGRIDIENTS  FOR EYE MAKE UP PERFECTION .
2235,Good Treatment_I bought this for myself and then for my niece.  She loved it so much that we went to Deva to get her hair cut - and she loved that too!
5710,"Snow Bunny_Beautiful color, cures beautifully and no shrinkage. Takes a few extra coats for opaque coverage when worn alone, but makes for a great french tip. It isn't a stark white, but a beautiful creamy white. Gelish is the only polish I will ever wear.  2-3 weeks on fingers and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth. Perfect for the busy mom who doesn't have time to polish her nails 4 times a week!"
6347,"Awesome!!!'nn_Wow and wow.  Makes my skin look totally rejuvenated after use!  I only use it 1-2 x per week bc I have sensitive skin and though  generally oily, if I use this too much I get dryness and some peeling at the corners of my nose and my chin.  Otherwise, this is Must-Have in your skin are regimen.  The lactic acid in the product does WONDERS for your skin.  It's amazing!"
1004,"Great Nail Product..._This is the second bottle of Jason Tea Tree Nail Saver I have purchased and it lasts a long time.  It instantly moisturizes my nails and cuticles and my nails look healthy.  It smells like tea tree oil, but is not super strong smelling; good stuff."
9445,"Nice smelling moisturizer but no miracle for hiding imperfections_I received this as an on the vine purchase and have used the bb creams made for the face before so was hoping this would be great.  It rubs in easily and is not greasy at all and does leave your skin feeling moisturized. I love the smell of it.  I know some people said how strong of a scent it is, I didn't see it as being strong at all. It smells good while your putting it on but it's not like you can smell it the whole day, it does dissipate. Also, I noticed on the box it says to allow to dry before getting dressed.  It really doesn't take long to dry at all and I have never had it come off on clothing. Since it is tinted I wasn't sure if I had to worry about my hands turning orange if I didn't wash them right away or streaking if it wasn't applied correctly, but that is not the case. There is no streaking or orange hands to worry about. The tint is so slight you can barely tell.  I am fair skin and do have freckles on my arms and I can't say this did any miracle as far as reducing the appearance from imperfections and really haven't noticed as to where I can say it visibly firms skin.All in all, I can say it is a nice smelling moisturizer that does moisturize. If your looking for it to hide imperfections, I would have to say keep looking. The other downside is the tube is not that big for a body cream so you do end up using quite a bit and the tube doesn't last all that long. I probably wouldn't purchase it again unless it was much cheaper."
1370,"Very strong grapefruit scent, gets the job done_Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash, Pink grapefruitI didn't think much of the pink grapefruit extract until I used this for the first time. Wow, I can almost taste the grapefruit in my mouth when I washed my face! The grapefruit extract is very powerful, but in a very good way. The scent doesn't linger long, and the vitamin C is supposed to help clear the skin and prevent acne breakouts. There's 2% salicylic acid to treat acne, which is commonly found in many over-the-counter acne face washes.I found that this acne wash clears my skin very well but I haven't experienced any signs of over-drying. I have used it for several days without any side effects or complaints. The grapefruit extract scent makes it seem like someone just cut several fresh grapefruits and squeezed the juices all over my face. It is very invigorating.Reading some of the other reviews, I'll have to point out that my face is quite oily. After washing my face thoroughly, I will have a layer of oil within 1-2 hours of just sitting inside my house not performing any physical activities. So if your face tends to get very dry in a short amount of time, I'd recommend using this product sparingly (e.g., once a day instead of twice a day) and to use moisturizer. I've never had to use moisturizer on my face unless it was an extremely dry and cold winter.Overall: 4/5 stars, kind of pricey, very strong grapefruit scent (some people are allergic to strong scents), but the salicylic acid does help a little with acne breakouts.If you're not a fan of grapefruit, I'd recommend looking for Neutrogena's regular acne face wash which has the same 2% salicylic acid."
3440,"Good product_This is the first time I have tried this product, and in few days I could see my skin looks smoother and younger. I also use this product in combination with Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream to get the best result. I would recommend this product to everyone."
2827,"Works well_Now that I no longer live in Southern California, my opportunities to burn aren't as high. But, this cream was useful over the Summer on our faces and arms. It doesn't have that too antiseptic-like smell that some after burn or post sunburn products have. I will use this cream again and suggest it to others."
8345,"One of the best shaving creams I have used_The Dove Men+Care shaving cream is a great for those who have sensitive skin. After using this my skin was the softest it has ever been after shaving. Usually my skin feels irritated after I shave but with the Dove shaving cream it felt soft and refreshed. And comnined with the Dove Men after shave balm, my skin felt and looked great. I highly recommend this product and others like it in the Dove Men+Care skin line."
3839,"Great_Fantastic product! Very natural colors without reddish/orangey shade many brown brow products have. The only thing I don't like is the brush that comes with the kit, so I use a different one, but that is a very minor thing. I will keep repurchasing this brow powder, it is PERFECT, and is very affordable too."
2130,AWESOME_This rates right up there with Urban Decay primer potion. I actually like it better than the UD primer. It works really well maybe even better. You won't disappointed in buying this product. I will buy this over and over again!
1714,"Great price for the brushes_I prefer the softer, sensitive brushes on my skin with my Clarisonic as opposed to the Normal pack. Every three months, (like a electric toothbrush head), the brushes become old and not as effective. New ones ensure that the Clarisonic continues working efficiently. I'm careful to use this brush once a day, since twice a day seems to be too much now.The only other quip I had with this set was that the seller who sold me these new brushes did not include them in packaging.  Other than that, it's a good deal."
5445,"GOOD SIZE BOTTLE, GOOD VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY_I like this product and I've purchased it at least twice. I like the color that it produces and especially like it because the bottle contains 10 ounces. It has gone up in price lately so I've purchased other similar products with regret. I will definitely purchase this product again in the future."
9622,Best curling iron for long hair_Love this My grandaughters hair is long and straight and I was able to fix her hair and it stayed curly for the longest time. Never happened before :)
5587,"Skin care enhancement_Nowadays there are all sorts of skin care products and services that offer making one's skin feel better and look younger.  I came across this product by accident.  Unlike many high tech solutions (LED light, micrtocurrent, lasers) this is mechanical device with little needles that one can roll arond the face (my device's needles are 1 mm long).I was thrilled when I received this product.  It is small and very handy to use.  Needles are very small but very sharp.  Despite their sharpness, they will not hurt your skin, device will invirogate the top layer of the skin and one will feel tinkling on the parts that roller was used on.  I typically use this roller in the evening.  After I remove makeup, exfoliate skin, clean it with cleanser and tone, I use roller for a few minutes on my chin, cheeks and forehead.  I finish up by applying eye cream, face serum and night cream for face and neck.  It is still early for me to say if there are any significant results, but for now I just like the tingling effect that tool creates.  This tool comes in a handly little plastic container.  I wish there are better instructions on the box how to keep this tool desinfected after certain number of uses.  I guess, I will just emerse it in alchohol for a while and continue to use it in a manner I am using it now."
2373,"Great...If used correctly_This product is great for acne.  BE AWARE that this product contains only THREE ingredients: Salicylic acid, Lactic acid, and Ethyl Alcohol.  When you apply it, yes, it will sting.  You are only supposed to apply a small amount. I place a cotton ball over the top of the bottle, turn in upside down, and then turn it right side up quickly.  Whatever amount I have on the cotton ball is good enough.  I then quickly wipe my face with it.  It burns, yes, but look at the ingredients.  You are only supposed to use a small amount of this 1-3 times a week (more if your skin has gotten used to it).  I've had this product for six months and I only use it 2 times a week.  There have been many reviews saying that this made their skin peel.  If you use too much too often, YES, it will make your skin peel. If you use a lot of it too often, you are harming your skin.  You must use a small amount when applying and only apply it 1-3 times a week.  If your skin starts flaking, you've used too much too often.  Bottom line-this is a miracle worker for tough pimples and blackheads.  You need to give it time to work (I didn't start seeing results until 2 months in), but you need to use caution and be smart about how much you are putting on your skin and how often you are applying."
549,"Aubrey is NOT the best, but it sure is the most expensive!_We bought this directly from Aubrey, along with a conditioner of theirs, and not only is this shampoo not as good as the Nature's Gate herbal shampoos, it is more than twice as expensive per ounce. This Aubrey shampoo cost us $11.48, but that was only for a small-sized 11 ounce container.  I had heard that Aubrey was over-priced, but I believe it's both over-priced and of lower quality than other brands. It certainly isn't nearly the good deal that Nature's Gate herbal shampoos are. This is ridiculous..."
6538,GREAT DEAL for the money!!_This is an amazing deal!!!!!! You get all of those eyeshaddows in literally any colour you will ever want orneed for such a cheap price!! The eyeshaddows are nicely pigmented aswell so i woild happily pay more for this set.
7605,re:_I LOVE THIS STUFF..... This stugg works so good for my skin...I would recommend to any one with bad skin
9922,"Needles to say, this is a great needled roller..._This is my second derma roller. Once you get used to them they are great. You have to train your skin and then if you keep it up you start to see healthy skin benefits almost immediately. It really is a great product. This one is a little different than my previous version with smoother rolling which I really enjoy. It is also a smaller surface which means it takes longer but is way more functional on countour areas where you need a slim approach. Really glad to find this option to complement my other roller and love the feel and the benefits for my skin. Your skin is the largest organ and also the one most susceptible to damage...Take care of it!!"
4200,"Wonderful Bottle_I'm glad I got it. I've noticed a significant decrease in the amount of nail polish remover I use now with this bottle. I enjoy the fact that it doesn't leak or drip....that's a huge plus for me.  Best purchase, wish I'd gotten it sooner."
3580,"Doesn't last long_We like a moderate amount of bubbles in the bath and this doesn't last that long (maybe 10 baths). However on the up side, it doesn't leave a soap scum ring around my tub."
8266,Pleasantly Surprised_Dove Men Care Hydrate Face Lotion is better than I expected.  The lotions absorbs very quickly and does not leave feeling sticky or oily. I also like the scent which is fairly light not to overpowering.  The dispenser is a little gimmicky but it works so far.  The sun screen is a nice bonus (this appears to be in the Hydrate version only).
1315,good eye cream_great eye moisturizer for sensitive skin. fragrance free. best use in night time since it's a little oily under makeup.
1325,"Super brush!_I have long, thin hair...  but I have a lot of it and it has various textures...  this brush has helped me defeat my hair!  It is light, but powerful!  I am happy to say that this brush has helped me defeat many bad hair days! Highly recommend."
9428,"Will Likely Purchase_I have used this product several times, starting about four weeks into a highlight. It seems to have improved the color and kept it fresh. Enough so that I will continue to use it and probably purchase another when I run out. It doesn't take much, and after using it twice per package instructions, the bottle is still almost full.An update: two months later, I haven't had to highlight my hair, because this product is doing a great job keeping my hair highlighted."
8805,great product_absolutely love the product can't wait to use it can't wait to do my friends nails so I can make them look even more better than now
1961,"Fantastic_I was skeptical, but I figured for the low price it was worth a try. I LOVE this mask. I use it once a week with the apple cider vinegar, and it's made my skin softer, pores smaller, and kept away breakouts. I did get a bit of skin redness immediately after use, but it goes away in a few minutes after I toned and lightly moisturized."
3566,"Makes your skin glow_I've been using this serum for about two years now, and really love it! I have oily skin with large pores, but I usually only break out around that time of the month. I was worried, however, that this serum might be too oily for my skin, but it's not at all.The serum has a medicinal/herbal scent that may be too strong for some people at first, but, after a couple of minutes, the scent not noticeable at all. (I happen to really like the scent, but my husband can't stand it.)Since it's pretty thick, I use it only at night, and usually use it maybe two or three times a week (on the nights when I don't use Retin-A). I usually apply this about 15 minutes before I go to bed so it has some time to sink in -- I use two drops to cover my face and undereye area, and two more drops to cover my neck and chest. The bottle it comes in in small, but it lasts awhile, probably about six months or so.It also doesn't leave any residue on my pillow case. When I wake in the morning after using this, my skin has a healthy glow and my fine wrinkles (I'm almost 39) are smoother and less noticeable."
7584,love_i love how this set comes with many sizes you can do so much with each brush and so easy to use and clean
3311,"Glossy!_I'm liking the lip gloss so far idk about other Ppl but these gloss make my lips look injected hahahha like I had surgery and I like it, it's kinda sticky but it smelled awesome!!"
8679,"Another great Tresemme product_Tresemme has a knack for creating great , great product. The wife was very pleased to receive this item , and the bottle lasted a very long time , as only a little is needed at a time.Great value for the $$$$$$$$$$$"
8668,"Smells great, works great_As the title of my review suggests, this shampoo both smells and works wonderfully.  The formula is quite thick and rich, but it lathers up easily and nicely on the head, and rinses clean. I used this shampoo with the matching conditionerTresemme Keratin Smooth Keratin Infusing Conditioner, 25 Ounce, and my hair felt amazingly clean and soft.  I'm also loving the scent of fruits with a slight perfume.  The scent isn't an easy one to describe, but it is lovely.I'm generally a user of cheap shampoo and conditioner, and my hair usually does just fine with that.  Using this shampoo is a pleasure, though, and this may convince me that there's something in buying more upmarket hair products."
3927,Wow_Wow what a pro make set! And I think it is at a great price! Love the case it looks great!
6732,Neutrogena_Brought this for my daughter.  She loves it.  What do  expect from all Neutrogena products?  They do what they say.
2838,They came to me fast_I love the fact that they came to me in the mail almost 3days later there was no fuss and they look awesome. to be honest i thought they were smaller but i see why they are so big. But i love my order and I'm looking forward on ordering more.
6872,One of the best purchases on Amazon_This brush shet is perfect for nail decorating. I have purchased a set from Sally's and this one by far exceeds those. I would definitely purchase this set again when mine need replacing. Why spend so much when this is cheaper and a superior set.
5838,Great_I love Tarte Cosmetics.  This mascara makes your eyelashes stand out. I also like their lights camera lashes. Helps lashes to grow.  This is better than Bare Minerals volumizer by far.
7436,"Excellent_I recieved some sample packets of this product and the matching shampoo in the mail.  I was extremely impressed.My hair gets baked and beaten almost on a daily basis since I swim outside every day in the tropical sun.  Often I swim in the ocean.  What a tangled mess it can become.  There are times when no brush or comb will begin to go through it.I used this conditioner as I showered outdoors after coming out of the pool.  My hair immediately smoothed, softened and turned to silk, and a comb could glide through it no problems.When my hair dried it was full, and shine with tons of body.  I was amazed.  They have a great product here.  I plan to get a bottle of this to take to the pool and beach with me, and coat my dry hair with it before I enter the water, to protect it from damage, as my stylist recommended.  This is a fantastic conditioner."
2124,"Sulfates_Would love to try but all shampoos have sulfates which are well known to strip color from dyed hair. What a shame because they insist some of their shampoos are good for color treated hair, not if they have sulfates."
9867,"Inexpensive Botox!_I really love this Hyaluronic Acid Skin Serum.  It has worked wonders on my face, dramatically improved my skin, this is such amazing product, I feel and look younger every time I use it."
3347,"Suave Kids 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner Cowabunga Coconut_This is a very good shampoo/conditioner combo.  I've bought this many times before for my kids (and myself) because it lathers up easily, rinses out nicely, hardly has a scent after blow-drying and it makes it so EASY for my kids to shampoo their hair.  They only have to apply a small amount and rub it into their wet hair, scrub around a bit and then rinse it out.  No need for conditioner so there's fewer bottles in the shower, less mess and saves on water.  And it really helps with untangling their long hair.  Great product at a great price."
2794,"Pretty good product especially for price_I had read lots of reviews on this product and went to my local grocery store to find it and it turned out it wasn't in stock so I bought a different deep conditioner for the time being but 4 months later I was browsing through th hair care isle looking for fun new products to try as I often do, when I noticed they had it, I don't like it as much and my other deep conditioner (triple moisture deep conditioner) but it was very close call on a plus it has 8 oz I think and my other deep conditioner only has 6 and is a dollar more."
6350,Excellent Fun for Halloween_This is a fun little treat for Halloween.  The product is thin which makes it easy to apply neatly but requires more than one coat.  First coat looks a bit like your nails are sickly and will not provide sufficient glow power.  With 2-3 coats the color and glow intensify.  We used this under black crackle polish by Mia Secret and nails still glowed.
4992,"Great lashes_I love the Ardell lashes, they are very natural looking, the band is very comfortable, not like other brands where the band is so thick and pokey.  would repurchase!"
5065,"Wife loves it and she is staying with it... that is huge!_My wife loves this. It is her favorite shampoo and that says a lot for a woman who switches shampoos, hairsprays, and things like this faster than The Flash can stand up."
7803,"great for a play_My teen daughter is participating in a play where she starts out with long hair and then after a short trip, she comes back with short hair - she purposely sells her hair.  Since she has naturally short, wavy, dark brown hair, we ordered the dark brown wig.The wig looks more like the girl in the picture that is wearing the light brown wig.  Our dark brown wig has no bangs and it has a burgundy shade.  It is soft and manageable.  We have brushed it several times and used serum to keep the frizz down.The length of the wig is between 32-35 inches (32 without stretching the curl).  My daughter is a gymnast which means she's not very tall (maybe 5&#8217;2&#8221;) so the very end of the curls (without stretching) reach all the way down to her waist, that's exactly what she needed!The top of the wig has a very unnatural look, you can see a little bit of the net under the wig, but she'd be wearing a wide lacey head band, so far it works.  She has to treat the wig as her natural hair during the play, she brushes it, makes an updo, and puts it down again.  This wig does the trick as long as it is well fastened on the inside.  Good for the price and purpose."
4773,"I'm keeping this forever_This is the answer to my prayers.  Originally I bought the Revlon titanium flat iron but that was cheap. This is the best flat iron that has ever touched my hair. I don't know why it has bad review because I absolutely love it. Between the products that I use and this, my hair is silky smooth. I normally have coarse thick hair. This is just absolutely amazing.If you have short this will not work because of how wide it is. Duh! And if you have thick hair like me and not using the right products then you can't expect the flat iron to do miracles.Bottom line, I'm so in love with this flat iron. Dork why people say you can't read the temp. If you have it side ways then of course it not going to see it. Do you hold it phone side ways to text? I love this and i would never spend $200 on a flat iron. This is AWESOME!!!!!!!"
311,"Good Product_Good astringent, smells terrible though like dirty socks! [...]Check out all the ways you can use it and try it out."
2487,Does nothing for me_I can't scream fake because I have no clue. It is the same label as sold elsewhere. I am not a Moroccan fan of anything.  It is suppose to be great for split ends and adding moisture. I'm not seeing it! No more Moroccan anything for me!
3466,"Great Variety and Quality for the Price_You would be hard pressed to beat the price for this product. The product is fairly decent quality, definitely above bargain brands. The unit shipping quickly but a few of the eye shadow rounds broke in the shipment. This, of course, did not affect the use of the product as all the material was still there. The case is even pretty nice for the size and the included mirror, although we don't use it here, is fairly nice to have as well. The selection of colors really does make for endless possibilities and I highly recommend this product at five stars."
542,"All-natural, non-irritating, moisture-rich conditioner_This conditioner is perfect if you have dry, coarse, frizzy hair - I do and it makes my hair soft and smooth.  I have been using it for a few weeks now and my hair just keeps getting softer and shinier.  It is also non-irritating (I have extremely sensitive skin) and protein-free (protein tends to make my hair feel crunchy).Just be warned that it is extremely rich and doesn't fully rinse out.  Some people can use it 'as is' but I get the best results when I mix 2/3 White Camellia conditioner with 1/3 California Baby shampoo and use a small amount of that mixture as if it's a rinse-out conditioner.  That way it still leaves a tiny bit of oil in my hair but not too much.Edit May 2011: After some diet changes my hair became fine instead of coarse (same amount of hair, different texture).  I still like this conditioner with fine hair ... but only in very small amounts.  I use a pea-sized amount of it as a leave-in if my hair is looking too big and fluffy.  Mixing it with a different conditioner helps it to rinse out if you want to use it as a rinse-out conditioner."
3887,"great stuff_I use this styling paste for when I put my hair back...I use it almost daily when I put my hair into a pony tail for the gym.  I have fine, blonde hair...holds my hair in place without giving me a wet, crunchy hair look.  Love this product."
5879,NICE PRODUCT!_This mascara is very nice. It made my lashes look very long and very dark.  There was minmal flaking when I wore it for more than 15 hours but none on shorter days.  It went on smoothly and easily.  I used 2 coats for every day and 3 coats for evening.  No problems with clumping!!!  And that's a real plus.
6235,"Five Stars_I love it, it goes on smooth and looks great!"
4250,"Way too small_This is called a travel kit, but its more like an overnight bag. There is not enough here to last through a week's vacation. Plus its kind of pricey for such small quantities. What gives?"
5090,"Fabulous for fine hair and synthetic wigs!_I love that you can set the temperature on this wand very low. This means I can style my costume wigs, even the ones that aren't traditionally heat safe.  The ceramic rod heats up evenly from base to tip and the box contains every size I would ever use.Pros: No crimp marks from a traditional iron clamp.  Curls last all day and then some, even with the large barrel. Hard-to-curl hair is easily curled as long as the layer is not too thick."
8650,"Glitter_I am very happy with this product.The glitter is a little larger that what I thought it would be. They're about 3mm wide.I didn't get all of the colors which were shown, however I did not get any duplicates so I'm happy. The metallic colors I got were Silver, Magenta, Brown, Yellow, Gold. The translucent colors I got were Neon Yellow, Blue, Purple, Hot Pink, Orange, Green, and Light Pink.When it comes to the glitter staying on I apply it by placing a drop of clear polish on my nail where I want the glitter to be then I place the glitter on the drop and push down so that the clear polish comes up and over the edges of the glitter. I then apply a clear top coat immediately after. This process keeps the glitter flush with my nail so it doesn't come off until I want it to.Over all I am very happy with this product. If I ever run out of glitter I will defiantly be ordering more."
9022,"My Favorite Roller_I've used dermal rollers before, and generally stick to the cheapest versions since I replace them after 3 months use (I'm a slight bacteria-phobe, even after dousing these with alcohol after every use).  The Dermal Roller SGF is by far my favorite version!  No sticking or pulling and it's super comfortable to reposition (and the 1.0mm length really isn't painful for me).  Love love love this thing!Dermal rollers in general:  I was skeptical that puncturing my face repeatedly with needles would lead to noticeable improvements, but 2+ years of use has made me a firm believer.  Fantastic results in clarity and texture!  I generally try to roll 2x a week, and that seems to be enough to maintain impressive results.  I occasionally fall out of habit, but as soon as I hop back on, am continually amazed to look as if I've spent a long weekend receiving ridiculously expensive facials at a BevHills spa."
6704,Ideal nail art brushes!_I have been staring a pretty nail picture on Pinterest for too long - I finally got some tools so I could do it myself! These brushes let me recreate any nail art I've ever seen. They are super small which lets you get very detailed. Perfect for those that are into the nail art trend!
4114,Soft and eco friendly_I love the regular sized EcoTools brushes and this travel sized set of eye brushes does not disappoint. The bristles are soft and there is quite a variety of different brush styles to fill all of your makeup needs. I highly recommend this compact set of high quality brushes.
1040,Holds em in place!_Love this stuff. Works so well at holding my brows. An essential step every women needs in their beauty routine.
1948,"Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay - 2 lbs_Very happy with this product, a little goes a LOOOONNG way. Mixed with Apple cider vinegar and really cleaned out pores."
9632,"It does okay with some patience_This kind of product can get tricky and annoying at times. It was easier because this isn't the first time I've used self-tanners and I've gotten used to the fact that it tends to look more blotchy for a while and then you can even it up a bit over time. Some of it's a matter of paying attention to where you might have used not used enough on previous applications and try to touch it up a little. Over time, most areas average decently well.I'd go with the lightest version of the product that you think might work for you, because then the mistakes are less visible and you can blend things in more slowly. Results definitely tend to get better with practice, so don't use it just a few days before a big date or interview. You might even want to try it out initially in an area you usually keep covered, so that you feel a little more free to experiment without worrying that you'll look odd."
1737,"Love it_I love this facial moisturizer. I can use it in summer and winter. It even keeps up with the super dry, harsh Montana winters we have and keeps my skin feeling soft and not dried out. Plus, you can't beat the price and you get a huge tub!"
5148,"Must have for color treated hair_I buy this from my local store. I will never use another shampoo or conditioner on my hair.I LOVE this product.  Every styling issue I have ever had with my hair is GONE, and I see a major improvement in my hair from a year ago.I always get compliments on how healthy it looks and people are astonished I dye my hair every month and it still looks his way!Cant beat the price for perfect results.Highly recommended!!!!:)"
2185,"I love Cococare Cocoa Butter Sticks for moisturizing!_I am moving towards using natural products on skin, hair,etc. One step I have taken is to stop using Vaseline and other petroleum products. The only problem I had was the fact that Vaseline was the only product that kept my feet moisturized while I wore sandals.One day I saw the Cococare Cocoa Butter Stick at CVS and decided to give it a try. I rubbed the stick on my feet followed by a touch of olive oil. The mixture kept my feet supple and moisturized all day while I walked around in sandals! The mixture absorbed into my skin wonderfully. I'm so glad I've found a natural alternative to using Vaseline to moisturize my feet. I'll be a loyal Cococare Cocoa Butter Stick user for life!Ingredients: Cocoa Butter"
3631,"Fantastic Product!_Originally I received a generous sample of this shampoo in a gift box. I wasn't expecting any special results.Also, I was skeptical because the shampoo does not foam up like the regular commercial brands. I use hairspray, styling products, and go several days between shampoos. I was so happy with the results that I purchasedthis full-size version. The shampoo cleans every bit of hair spray or any other residue from my hair. It does notstrip out the natural oil and leaves my hair almost tangle-free and easy to manage. My hair is highlighted, so ittends to be dry, yet this product works perfectly for me."
1331,great quality for an inexpensive brush lasting over 3 months ..._great quality for an inexpensive brushlasting over 3 months so far and no bristles falling out or wood looking badgreat product
1807,Cute_I like these ...they are not huge like some scrunchies ...but if u have thick hair may not work for you . I can wrap them 2 times for a pony tail and i have thin hair . But great price and free shipping !!!
9601,"Works great on color treated, senior hair and no fragrance!_What little fragrance it does have did not bother my asthma/allergies and that is a priority for me.I am a new user of Tresemme products and I love this conditioning spray!  It is easy to use - a little goes a long way!My hair is colored strawberry blonde with gold highlights and wow, does it look great now!  I have healthy hair, but the Tresemme makes it look even better!The cost is great for anyone, especially those of us on fixed incomes, because it's a quality product for a reasonable price.Would definitely recommend!"
143,"it's ok_i would have loved it if it was my color. it makes my face kind of white so i just added it to my Aveeno daily moisturizer, which made it come out ok."
6421,Great product_I purchased these for my step-daughter to help her speed up the process of preparing her nails.  She loves them and helps to quicken the process.
8721,"Deep Space_I have tried several shower gels in the past few months. The best so far has been theAxe Shower Gel Apollo, 16 Ounce. I liked the sudsing action, the small scrubbing solids in the liquid, and the menthol-like scent of the soap. I also liked the easy rinse of the gel off of my skin without much residue, that slick soap feeling. This time, I am reporting on the Axe Deep Space 'Chill Out' Shower Gel. It has the good features of the Apollo of great sudsing and scrubbing solids, but it has a concentrated pine scent instead of menthol. Also, the Deep Space has a clear bottle so you can see how much of the Milky Way colored gel is left. The formula used for the Deep Space is even better than the Apollo for rinsing off the skin. One result of this is that the pine scent does not last quite as long as the menthol scent of the Apollo. That's fine with me. Both Axe shower gels are excellent, but I prefer the Deep Space."
6494,No noticeable difference_I have been using this product for a month and have noticed no changes in under eye puffiness or darkness. I think that any moisturizer would do the exact same thing as this product. Will not repurchase.
6333,"Fantastic!_My daughter was thrilled to receive these as part of her birthday gift. She loves playing with her nail polishes and nail designs during the &#34;off' season, and these grippers help her place her little jewels perfectly."
8607,"What a Disappointment_I was hoping this would be a keeper, but it really isn't. It's cheaply made and rather bulky.The pros:- There is a convenience outlet on the mirror's frame. This allows other appliances to be plugged in if the mirror is taking up the only outlet available.- The stand is adjustable, allowing for different angles that will accommodate the user's position.- The mirror is two-sided - one side is 1x and one is 5x.- There is a slider to change the lights' hue: Daylight (the bare fluorescent bulb), Office (+green), Evening (pinkish lavender, Home (full pink - flesh)The cons:- It's just cheap-looking and not terribly sturdy.- It's too big to fit on most bathroom countertops or dressing tables (if anyone has those anymore).- The color choices are minimally effective.- The box indicates that there are three options for magnification: 1x, 5x, or 10x. There are only two mirror options, so I'm not sure if they are referring to one's distance from the magnifying mirror, which, frankly, doesn't work because of the issue with limited focal point of the concave mirror.- There are instructions on the frame: 'Rotate flat mirror up to close side mirrors.' Since I couldn't find any side mirrors, I couldn't figure out what needed to be  closed. Then I realized 'close' is an adjective not a verb. It's simply stating that one needs to turn over the flat (1x) mirror and rotate the magnifying mirror (5x) into position. Well, duh.- 'Florescent' is spelled wrong on the box; it should be fluorescent. Oh yeah. I take off points for spelling.- There are two 6 watt fluorescent bulbs that, according to the instructions, 'should never need replacing.' This is followed by instructions stating that should they need replacing, the unit must be returned to the factory or installed by 'competent electrical appliance personnel.'In short, this might work for a young girl who's playing with make-up, but really doesn't seem to fit an adult's lifestyle, at least not as a product that is prominently displayed. Perhaps it could be used temporarily, placed back in its box, and put in the closet."
5981,love it! Great scent and works really well_I love this shampoo. It really does smell like bananas and imparts a great scent onto my hair It is sort of thick so I was worried that it would be too moisturizing. But that's not the case. It works up into a nice lather but doesn't dry out my hair. It gives it a lot of body and just enough moisture to not weigh it down. Rinses out easily. Now I understand why this is one of the Body Shop cult favorites.
1918,"Product Works, the Scent Doesn't_I wrap my hair to stretch my natural curls/waves. Wrapping requires less heat and hot tools on my hair to keep it straight. Hair wrapping uses your head like a roller to keep your flat-ironed hair straight overnight too and minimizes the need to flat-iron it again. (To get more general info on hair wrapping go to You Tube search for 'wrap your hair and keep it straight overnight' and watch the video.)Wrap lotions are similar to setting lotions for wrapping hair, wet sets, blow drying, and up dos. I am used to wrap sprays. This is the first time I used a foaming one. This foam is like a medium hold light mousse.The Foaming Wrap Lotion didn't make my hair crispy or sticky like some other products. It made my hair shine, not as good as the commercials, but better than usual before applying shine serum or shine pomade. Overall the product is good BUT I don't like the scent which did die down but lingered.My Directions:- Start with damp conditioned hair.- Part hair in 8 sections and clip each- Apply one pump of mousse to a section combed it through until all sections were completed.... use more if desired!- Proceed with the wrap process using hair clips, paddle brush and wrap scarf.Stay On Satin Natural Style Wrapping Scarf #1170- Let hair completely air dry OR use a hair dryer- Flat-iron hair as usual.* Wrap hair overnight to maintain flat-ironed straight style and reduce hair breakage and tangles."
2299,works great_This brand of hairspray and also Adorn are the only 2 brands that really work in my opinion. I've tried the other brands.
9917,"Love it!_Super easy to use!  Just mix up some goo, slather it on and wrap your self in some plastic wrap!"
3265,great eye pencils_I love them and I intend to buy more. Colors go on really smooth and vibrant.Nice size for holding and using.
1009,"Pretty expensive for the size, but who can argue with results?_I love this stuff; it is really one of my favorite acne products. just put it on a couple times a day, and it will reduce the size and redness of a pimple that you just popped. Another reviewer has mentioned that it is used on movie sets and by actors. I don't doubt it, it can take down the size of a unpopped pimple pretty quickly too. If you're thinking about getting it, i would suggest you try; It may be pricey, but i bought a tube months ago and I've still got half left. A little goes a long way with this stuff."
2199,"Love the scent!_I've always loved the scent of earl grey tea so when I saw the bergamot oil on Amazon I knew I had to purchase it.  The Now Foods brand of bergamot oil is a quality product at a reasonable price, and the citrus scent is a winner."
9729,"A great body wash_I like everything about this body wash and I love the scent. The scent is supposed to be &#34;sun-kissed lily and pink grapefruit essence.&#34; I don't smell much lily, but I love the grapefruit. The body wash foams up easily and a small amount produces plenty of suds, even in my very hard water. It rinses off easily, but leaves your skin feeling soft.I will definitely purchase this product in the future."
4194,Great Cheap Entry into Lash/Brow Accelerator Market_Glad I didn't buy the 3-pack because I think after using 1 bottle the effects plataeu but its also an excellent lash primer if you want to keep it around. DO NOT GET IT IN YOUR EYES. It stings sooooooo bad! Just be careful in your application and you can avoid this. I def' saw results by the 4th day and now I can go to the 'beauty bar' at the Benefit counter and get movie star brow shaping and I could not have grown my brows out for that without this product due to over waxing my brows on the part of my former nail salon. Yeahhhhh!
4824,Gooey and gloppy_I agree with the other reviewers. I have used the CND Shellac and love it. Like the Gelish color and top coat but the foundation is a gloppy mess that made my nails look lumpy. Too bad. I guess I will have to go back to Shellac . . .
7694,"Amazing_I just got mine today and started using it right away. Wow, it is by far the best I have ever used. I read several of the other reviews and was glad I did. You do need to be gentle.....lay  the rasp on your skin and g-e-n-t-l-y  use it.  I can see how you would be asking for  days worth of pain if you get too aggressive. Work over a towel, and have a very rich cream or vaseline  and pair of clean socks ready . After you are done, and your feet are nice and smooth , slather the jelly or cream on liberally , put on your socks and  rest or go to bed to let it do its thing. I like to use my Emjoi  foot &#34;sander&#34; for  parts of my feet I can't use with the rasp, and to  make sure my feet are completely silky smooth. I have always had a terrible time trying to keep my feet callus  free, and this rasp is  a wonderful product.  I also like that you don't have to soak your feet. It's my new favorite beauty tool, if it works on my feet , and makes them so nice , then it will help you  :)  Just remember...use it g-e-n-t-l-y ."
9875,Works like a charm_My face is looking amazing! I'm so happy I got this and that it's working so well. Fully intend to buy more when I need it.
8831,"Decent full spectrum sun screen_I'm not a super huge fan of the shinies, but that's my only real qualm with this moisturizer.  It's light weight, smooth under makeup, and it has a very light fragrance that reminds me of rose petals.  I have SLE with photo-toxicity, which means that sunscreen actually has to work, or I break out in a rash and get sick from being in sunlight or fluorescent light.  This lasted long enough for me to do errands in bright daylight and lots of fluorescent store lighting.  Which is good.I just wish they'd gone a little less heavy handed on the luminous part."
5809,"Not recommended for sensitive skin_I have sensitive, acne prone skin. I wanted to like this sunscreen but unfortunately it broke me up and so I returned it after a week of use."
9627,"Love it, wrong color_Love the product but it's the wrong color. I purchased ebony when I should have gotten dark brown or chocolate. Should've swatched before ordering online."
5750,"Great brush set_No shedding, good for all sorts of basic face makeup application.  I've used the contour brush for powder highlighter (excellent), the pointed foundation brush for liquid foundation (very good), and the buffing brush for cheek-apple blush.  I haven't used the little brush yet, but I'm sure it would be excellent for concealer.  RealTechniques are really the best brushes for your money, bar none."
8065,Great_I bought these as a birthday gift for my little sister and she says she loves them because they go on so smoothly. She had to give the light pink one to me because they were so pale. It suited my dark skin and small lips tho.
8759,"Already broke in half...._I would definitely not recommend this to anyone,  the comb broke in half on about the third use....lovely.  Seller was a fast shipper tho... lol"
5249,"my favorite_First time using it.. and it is now my favorite mascara. I like the fullness it gives my lashes, without clumpy mess that some mascaras leave behind."
9462,Refreshing . ._I don't have dark circles but I do have puffy eyes in the morning.  I keep mine in the refrigerator and when I use it in the morning I can feel it tightening and I know the ingredients are natural and contain vitamins and it seems to be working for me.
1716,NICE PRODUCT_I like these because they really do hold your curlers in well. Glad I purchased them and the price was great.
9576,"Works like It says!_Wonderful product! I use it ever week to treat my hair and allow it to heal from what damage I put it, from my styling products, heating tools etc.. This product does what it says and I am glad got one!  It makes my hair feel so soft and adds a great shine."
7007,"Works for my hair_I straighten my hair using a flat iron spray, then after that I rub this in the palms of my hand and smooth it down my hair especially on the ends. I then take the hairdryer and comb through it while drying for a second. I think it works great!!!"
8418,It's pretty good._This stuff works best when you mix it with other indoor lotions such as Designer Skin Bombshell Tanning Lotion 100XX.  It reallly gives you great color.
1885,"Great_I have been using this product for a couple years now and it seems to be getting harder and harder to find.  I am glad you carry it, I wish it was offered on subscribe and ship."
3416,"love it_I used have really nasty break outs and I tried everything in the drug store. It was really bad. Then I started learning about what they put in those 'miracle' cleansers, toners and lotions. So I realized that problem is not my face, but in what I used. So I searched for toxins free cosmetic and I tried different things. But Burt's Bees cleanser works best for me, so now I'm stick to it. It works great for me. I recommend to try it."
5537,"Really amazing leave-in product!_The reason why I say 'amazing product' but only give it a 4 is because it does help a lot to smooth and soften your hair but the smell goes off way too fast.I can really feel the amazing state of super soft and light of my hair after spraying this product, but the smell goes off after 20 minutes.So yes, I would definitely recommend this leave-in conditioner to people but I would also hope the producer improves its fragrance time."
342,"Favorite body lotion ever_I just love this lotion. It smells great, sinks in fast, hydrates well, and doesn't irritate or break out my skin. Perfection. I always get compliments on how soft my skin is, so i know it works!"
851,"Mmmmmmmmm!!!!_Totally in love with this smell!! It is sexy and I always get compliments on it. A little goes a long way, so you only need one spray! You will love it.. buy it!"
7398,good price_i buy and wear to pair for a natural look look real will buy more of these they look very natual
1241,hair straightener_it's a fine line- style and damage hair or have unruly healthy hair.  I have a tendency use a straightener more often than I should.  I don't know if this is 'therapy' for your hair but I do feel that it is 'damage control' for my hair.  I takes a bit to get used to the feel of you hair sliding through the Teflon plates but after that it's a breeze.  I still have the same complaint about the buttons being poorly placed.  Most Remington straighteners have that problem. As you are using the iron it's difficult not end up with your fingers changing the temperature. You have to hold it further up and try not to burn your fingers.
8475,"Works Good for Mustaches As Well_Much to my chagrin, my husband decided a few months ago to wear a mustache with a slight handlebar and wanted a bit of wax to shape it with. I couldn't find anything mustache specific that wasn't expensive, so I got him a sample size container of this Axe Spiking Glue to use. It has worked out great both from the sample size and from this larger tube. He finds it shapes well but loosens up and rinses quite easily with water for removal at the end of the day. Until his mustache fad passes, I know this will be a staple."
5110,"Yes, purple lipstick_I really wanted a purple lipstick. This brand purple has great pigment. I have tried it in the house a few times but have not worn it out yet. I am sure it will look great with the right outfit."
1926,Dryness begone_This hair lotion does to the hair what a good moisturizer does to you skin. Protect hair from the harshness of the daily grin with Motions at home oil moisturizer!
5974,perfect_I recommend this product for people with thin to meduim hair.  Hair does not get tangled in it. I've used several similar products and recommend this one.
1781,"It really works!_I was skeptical to purchase this product because I've never tried anything like it. After using it for about 2 months, I must say that my lashes are longer! The only thing is that this product did not thicken my lashes or eyebrows just lengthened them. Either way, a difference was noted and I will continue to use this product!"
7289,"once you get the hang of it...._i like nail art. i am a fan. and with nail tape i can get a proper straight line. yay!now, i have tried just using the tape itself for details and having it do accents, and i will admit that the tape peels after about a day or two, even with mass amounts of clear coat on top. it is possible to keep it on for longer, you would just have to trim it the perfect size (overhang will start to peel, and once it starts that piece of tape is done for) and put the tape on while your nail is wet from the original coat. then top coat the s*** out of it.BUT, using it to do details and then peeling it off? perfect! paint your nails, put the tape on, then do an accent color over top, and then peel the tape off. it will give you a straight line and will look awesome. i promise."
1394,Does exactly what it says!_Bought this buffering lotion after purchasing the drying lotion and having great success. I alternate them nightly. There is a complete difference in my skin after 2 weeks! No longer getting regular breakouts on my chin and my skin looks markedly clearer. I use the drying lotion on any bumps that start to appear and they are literally gone in a day. I alternate every other night with the buffering lotion to keep the area clear and bacteria free. My chin has given me problems for years due to hormonal breakouts and this line has been a miracle help!
2292,Love this Item_I just started to use this product and I already have noticed a huge difference in my nails. Love it!
1721,"you won't regret it._i've been using this mascara for decades. it never hurts, it comes off with water, never runs or looks gross. it just evaporates. never hurts my eyes. it's a must. and the mirror on the jar is handier than you think for touch ups"
2432,"Pretty, dries fast, nice finish_Last season I found this at a beauty supply store and loved the color - at the time I didn't know it was a matte finish (non-glossy) polish.  I put it on and was befuddled by the flat unshiny appearance until I realized it was one of those newer matte polishes I'd heard of.This dries to a deeper color than pictured- I have it on now and think it is very close to a rich raisin color with a lot of purple in it.  Three coats worked for me - you might get by with two, but on two finger tips I could see some white shining through so I went with one more coat.If your nails are nicely shaped, this color will look terrific.  Without the high gloss you're used to in polishes, there's no shiny distractions, the focus falls right on the nail.  I have slightly ridge-y nails and the ridges are more pronounced with a matte polish.In an effort to smooth the ridges and get the color to last, I used a clear coat after each layer of purple.  It did lessen the ridge-y appearance.  That was Saturday night.  It's Tuesday morning now and the ends of each tip are beginning to wear so the life of this polish isn't very long, even with some protection.  I'll touch it up, but it's funny - without the gloss, somehow the tip wear is less visible.I love that this dries fast and looks very neat, an edgy color that's not loud.  If you don't mind keeping up with it a little, this will be a nice addition to your collection."
451,"Absolutely amazing!_I have no words. These are truly a must have. I like to do a lot of the vintage pin up hair and these give you that look in literally minutes. They are super easy to use, they heat up in just 5 seconds, and they come with a large variety of sizes. The best I've ever used. No complaints what-so-ever."
4507,Nice_No clumping so far! Very happy.  Just the right consistency.  Slightly rounded applicator.  Nice and dark.  Made lashed look goodHappy with purchase.
5898,"Great for about ten minutes._It's a beautiful color and I love it. Maybe I just have a saliva issue, but the bright color goes away literally after about ten minutes. But if you don't mind reapplying it a lot, then it's a great buy."
4971,excellent customer service_Love this stuff! Amazon  is excellent to deal with as well! I had an issue and with one email all was handled with ease and speed. Love this company!
3053,"Does the job_Full disclosure -- I don't use this myself, however the recipient of the straightener tells me that indeed, it straightens hair. Taking only a few minutes to reach optimal straightening temperature, it's well formed for easy gripping. Nice large heat area to get the job done swiftly. After regular use for the past few months no problems reported."
9510,"Affordable and mild_Suave is known as an affordable option that still has decent quality. This 2 in 1 Anti Dandruff Classic Clean is very similar to Head & Shoulders. It is almost unscented and seems very mild, yet my scalp felt clean and itch free. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that my hair did not feel very conditioned and was less manageable than usual after using it. The Clear 2 in 1 did seem to moisturize better."
4469,"Gorgeous shimmer!_I am totally amazed at this eyeshadow.  You definitely need to use over eyeshadow primer to get the fantastic shades and shimmer.  The  difference between using with primer and not are like night and day.  I'm so pleased with this eyeshadow I plan on buying all the other sets available.  The case is very nice, too.  I use a brush to apply.  Stays on all day and does not crease, which may be attributed to the primer.  So many colors it's hard to decide which colors to use, and they are gorgeous. I use up to three colors at once and they blend just perfectly with each color staying true.  I get many compliments."
4728,"Can't Live Without It_I got turned on to Too Faced products when I discovered their phenomenal liquid foundation line, and this compact just continues to prove their line is the bees knees. I bought the powder to try as a lighter option, and was thrilled to find it provides excellent coverage with just one application, and, like its liquid counterpart, lasts all day. It's very lightweight and goes on smooth and even right on top of my moisturizer - and I'm good to go.Sometimes I use it to set the liquid after application and it really creates a perfect matte finish. There is no way to go wrong with this stuff - it's just amazing. I never leave the house without it.On top of all that, the packaging is adorable. I feel cute just carrying it."
4980,Just as good as Mac_I love coastal scent cosmetics after a friend turned me on to them I usally use Mac but hey change is good and CS has beautiful pigmented colors and the cost of it is definitely lower than Mac try it and see for yourself
3991,"Love Olay Regenerist_I've been using Olay Regenerist Daily Serum on my face for years, so it was a no-brainer to try this trio.  I really like the cleanser.  My skin tends to be dry, so I was worried that it might make me feel dry after use, but it doesn't.  I just feel clean and smooth.  The eye serum really does seem to help with little lines and I think the bags are less with regular use.  The regenerating cream is a little heavier than the daily serum I've been using for years.  I've stuck with the regenerating serum during the day and the regenerating cream for use at night.  GREAT combo!"
1138,"TRESemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Protective Spray_I like this product.  It gives body while protecting my dry, highlighted, thin hair.  My granddaughter has thick, long hair and it works wonderful for her too.. I would recommend this product."
9934,"Skin feels Incredibly soft and tighter real fast!_Incredible!  I wash my face and wait for it to dry completely.  Then use this acid which is a kind of thick clear gel and feels very refreshing.  Once it dries which is very fast, I immediately feel my skin tightening and incredibly soft.  Sometimes I use moisturizer over it but my skin already looks much more radiant and the pores smaller. Will definitely be a part of my beauty regimen from now on."
4848,"Barney Purple and takes a lot of work to apply......._If you are new to Gelish or gel nails, or need some tips and tricks:http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VWRFDI073BON/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R3VWRFDI073BON======I had my nails done at a salon while traveling, and Gelish was the only brand they had. Their selection of colors was limited; I was looking for black or grey but settled on what appeared to be a deep dark black purple in the bottle. You know how the Gelish bottles are, it's hard to tell what the ACTUAL color is.As the tech applied this, I wanted to throw up. I knew I'd hate it, but she had already started and I didn't want to deal with starting over. She had to apply three coats of this color, and even then I'm not happy with how little opacity it has. Her bottle was also quite thick, I was going to attribute this to the fact that it's a huge bottle of salon product and has probably been used a lot, but I see other people unhappy with the application so I will make mention of it. In general the tech didn't seem to truly know what she was doing (she did the base at 3 minutes, really???) but looking at this color and seeing her struggle with it, I don't think I could have gotten any better results with it. She actually persevered through this, whereas I would have given up, thrown out the bottle and maybe asked my client to pick another color.This color is like....someone threw up Barney on my nails. I *loathe* how this looks, on my pinkish-pale skin tone, this looks garish and cheap and disgusting. It looks like I don't know how to do my nails and just bought some ten cent polish at a garage sale and went at it. There isn't an outfit IN MY CLOSET that would in any way match or coordinate with this radioactive waste color!The color shown onsscreen is so pretty! But what's on my nails is like its far-distant nuclear-tainted cousin.UPDATE: So far several strangers have commented that they like my nail polish color, however....it wasn't surprising considering where I was. That's all I'm going to say.I have had this on a month now and I'll give it credit, despite the problem the tech had applying it, this still looks good and is still sticking. I have had to take nippers and clip the top, as it lifted near my cuticles. I will say that after a month, the color has kind of grown on me, though once in awhile I notice just how bad it looks against my skintone and have a moment of regret. It's just so---not for me. But I am thinking, if you had some nice effect topcoats, it COULD be salvageable."
920,moisture and shine_Philosophy has wonderful lip shines they moisturize they shine they sparkle and they taste good. Although I don't suggest eating it off! Bad for your lips. I wear this alone or on top of my lipglosses for that extra pop of shine. A really wet look thats oh so hot!!!!
6909,Best false eyelashes!_These false eyelashes are a great way to make your eyes pop!  They are the first set of false eyelashes that I didn't have to trim down!  I will definitely be buying these again!  Amazing price for a bulk purchase!!
9659,"Love it!!_This set is spectacular. So much to choose from, at this price point. Keeps my clients entertained and overwhelmed. If you want to see something really funny, take a close up look at plate #5...the small designs down the middle. One of my clients was looking through the plates and said, &#34;Who would want old people?&#34; I was like, what? So I looked at it, and sure enough, there's a design of two old people, hunched over, with a cane. Hilarious!!"
8907,"Best lashes!_This lashes are flawless! They are dramatic but look natural. They are easy to use, I recommend to anyone who wants to try lashes. I get compliments on these all the time and people think they are real."
3247,"Nice big, soft scrunchies!!_I liked the fabric, it's velvety.  The colors are nice and the elastic is soft.  They don't snag or feel too tight in my thick hair.  They seem versatile, like they would be good with formal or casual clothes."
9323,"Awesome brush gives flawless coverage_LOVE this brush. It's my new favorite for my mineral powder. I'm not even sure what about it makes such a difference, but when I put the mineral powder on with this brush, it looks almost like I've used concealer/foundation. It gives me a really smooth, even finish. This is now a must-have in my cosmetic brush arsenal! :)"
5845,"Great Brow set_Got this yesterday & i try using it, it was OK i like how my brow look like now more.Just doesn't like those lil tools stuff on it. But you get what you pay for. Still recommend this."
694,Yeah..Smells Like Musk_dont like the smell has a strong musk odor.. yuck if that what they mean by smell like a man.. then keep it.. other than that delievery was on time as projected.. but dont like the smell i wouldnt advise it unless your a fan of musk.. winters coming how about some deer musk
4447,"SUFFERING FROM STRAIGHT HAIR_I HAVE STRAIGHT HAIR, MEANING EVEN IF I TRY TO CURL IT WITH A CURLING IRON THEY WILL ONLY LAST ME ABOUT 2 GOOD HOURS. I READ SOME OF THE REVIEWS AND WAS SKEPTICAL BUT IVE BEEN WANTING TO TRY IT FOR SO LONG THAT I FINALLY GAVE IN AND BOY AM I GLAD I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! I RECEIVED MANY COMPLIENTS ON MY HAIR AND EVEN SOME CO-WORKERS WANTED TO PURCHASE IT. DOES TAKE SOME TIME AT FIRST TO GET USED TO BUT AFTER SLEEPING ON IT OVERNIGHT IT LOOKED GREAT IF NOT BETTER. VERY HAPPY WITH THIS."
2492,Confessions_Soooooo excited to use this in the summer!! Have not used it yet but I usually love anything from OPI!
2705,Excellent lotion!_This lotion has restored my dry skin to a supple and soft texture that I haven't had in many years. No other brand of lotion has been able to restore my skin the way the Vaseline Total Moisture lotion has. This product is almost to good to be true. I cannot recommend it highly enough. There is no overpowering fragrance here either. I am very impressed with this lotion.
1787,Great Brush_I use this to do french tip on myself by dipping it in alcohol and swiping the line clean and it works wonderfully.
4042,Yummy!_I think this is my favorite perfume ever!!! I love it!! So yummy! I get compliments all day long when I wear it! I keep smelling my own wrists! Can't wait to try their other scents!
6933,"Fantastic!_These plates were far better than other stamping plates that I have used.They arrived sooner than expected, Iwill be ordering again from cheeky."
6939,Sweet Details_I just had to order this one because these kind of remind me of those Samoan tattoos for some reason. Love the details in every image.
4186,"Perfect cuticle tool._They got this right. Only one word of warning, it's VERY Sharp which is not a bad thing, but don't slip while pushing back or cutting your cuticles."
5001,"Sexy, Alluring, Long Lasting_This fragrance is sexy smelling, alluring, and everyone tells me I smell so good when I am wearing it. The bottle design with the lady face is so unique. Thierry keep making good fragrances like this! This fragrance lasts a few hours. Worth the money!"
9304,"My mother's treatment....._My dear sweet mother has been my model for this Regrowth Treatment.  It appears as if she has a slight patch at the temple that periodically thins out.  This has been applied for about 30 days, and there is not a sign of regrowth as of yet.  It may take a little more time, we understand that.You have three tubes each for 30 days.  One of the things that may be understood in the healthcare business is that you lose hair during the seasons.  There are times when she notices more hair thinning, regrowth, then thinning again.The product supply is similar to Rogaine.  You get three tubes of liquid and a small dropper to apply it.  It is advised to apply it twice a day, and she has been doing that, probably missing a few times.You can rub this into the scalp, or merely drop it to the scalp.  Keep in mind that much of the liquid lands on remaining hair, rather than in the scalp.In comparison to Rogaine, this is not as strong of a smell.  That is the one difference.  And, I firmly believe that the results of Pantene are not as effective as Rogaine.  Will update laterThere have been no side effects noticed.  Her scalp is clear, nothing to indicate disruption.  Rizzo"
1362,"Love this goo_Best semi-permanant dye I've tried. Love the color you get from this even on untreated hair, hair doesn't get dry feeling, and it's not got that super chemical smell so others many do. And it glows under black light, fun at raves."
4071,"Sweet scent_This perfume smells so good! I sprayed it at the store, walked out, then had to go back and purchase it because it smells so good! Smells sweet with like a citrus/peachy note.This is for an older woman or a sophisticated young lady. Definitely wouldn't recommend it for ladies under 22, there are many other fragrances for younger ladies (like D&G; light blue, Coach, Juicy, etc), this is not one of them. (If you're planning to give this as a gift)"
3883,"Will continue to use_Hold is fantastic. A little use goes a long way. I do think that it builds up on the hair over time. That is the reason for the deduction of a star. However, a stripping shampoo or a couple of washes with baking soda and you are good to go. The nozzle on this NEVER clogs, by the way."
9365,Great Quality!_This Argan Oil is the real deal! It is wonderful for my long hair and I use it instead of conditioner. It also is great for acne and have been using it on my skin and nails as well. This Argan Oil is superior quality and has a nutty scent. I love that it is non diluted and has no additives or preservatives!
833,"not sure about the pheromone part..._I was looking forward to the arrival of this product, imagining the men flocking to my side&#8230;laying coats over puddles, carrying all my kids stuff for me, mowing the lawn to offer a little help to my awesome hubby...etc. I eagerly opened the box and took a big whiff of it. Whoa! My first thought was that it smelled very strong. It wasn't my &#34;usual&#34; scent style, but I still had visions of masses of men flooding towards me, so I powered through it and applied. To my surprise it ended up being a nice smell on me. And while I've stepped in quite a few puddles, carried my kids stuff like a sweaty pack mule, and the lawn hasn't been mowed&#8230;I've seen quite a few women behind me at the checkout being asked out on dates&#8230;weird."
1018,"Creates Awesome Waves_I love this wave iron so much! It creates really nice natural looking waves quickly. I have had mine for about a year now & everyone always wants to borrow it. I have naturally straight long hair & when I use this the waves lasts all day & look great the next morning even & I don't use any gel or hairspray on my hair. I use it on about the medium setting, its huge & a little awkward to hold sometimes but it doesn't take long at all to use on your hair so its worth it. Like some of the other reviews said, you have to find something safe to set it down on since it doesn't have a stand of its own, I actually set mine on a cookie sheet so it doesn't burn anything. I don't know how I ever managed without it, it creates such an awesome look."
1522,"Loved KONAD Nail Art Polish_Loved using, this polish, made especially, for nail stamping, with my Konad Stamping Plates.Easy application, right consistencyDefinitely , will be purchasing more."
7004,Great Nails !!!_My daughter got these in her stocking and she loved them. she actually did her nails right after opening presents.  JUST PERFECT !!  arrived on  time and in perfect condition.
4416,"Perfect for my skin type_I have dry skin that can get greasy throughout the day. If I put powder on it, my face looks flaky and icky. This stuff on the other hand is God's gift. Seriously. I'll put my primer, foundation, and concealor on and then just go about my day. By mid-day if my chin or forehead gets oily, I take a dab of gel and pat it OVER my greasy spots. At first it feels wet (don't rub it in; you will rub off your foundation also) but after about 30 seconds it will completely suck up the oil and your face isn't shiny anymore. It's in a little tube, but it will last forever since you don't need that much at all. I also like to put it on even if I don't have make-up if my face feels greasy. :)"
5564,vivo per lei eye treatment cream 0.5 fluid ounce_I RECEIVED THIS IN A TIMELY MANNER BUT YOU THINK YOU ARE GETTING IT IN A JAR AND IT CAME IN A PUMP THAT DID NOT WORK...I THINK ITS TOO THICK TO PASS THROUGH...AND YOU GET A VERY SMALL AMOUNT...SINCE ITS A PUMP ITS GOING TO BE HARD TO USE THE LAST OF IT....AS FOR HELPING AROUND THE EYES... I DO NOT SEE MUCH IMPROVEMENT BUT IT IS NONE IRRITATING....I AM USING THE DAY LOTION AND REALLY LIKE THAT.... IM DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ONE....
9730,"Helps with dandruff_I've been using this shampoo for over a week now and I can say that it has controlled my dandruff as well as more expensive and more well-known brands of shampoo. I especially love that a very little amount of this shampoo lathers up and goes a very long way. More product for the dollar is always a good quality for a product like this. The citrus scent is great, not too strong but enough to give your hair a clean smell. I will purchase more of this shampoo."
5929,"Not as good as Josie Maran_Got this based on good reviews, as a less pricey alternative to Josie Maran.How wrong I was. It's thicker and not as smooth as Josie Maran... and not as lasting...It's too thick for hair (makes it look greasy), and too thin/rough for hands and nails (so no lasting effect)Many other oils (including OPI's Avocado Oil) work much better."
4302,"Hidden Gem In the Acne Market!!!_I have tried all of these Acne kits, Proactiv, Clean & Clean, PanOxyl, Neutrogena, Clearasil, Aveeno, and even tried several PRESCRIBED Acne medications and kits and had so much frustration after time and time again seeing little to no results and an empty wallet! Finally, I had enough and went out on a limb and bought Burts Bees Acne two week kit. I was full of doubt and about to except the fact that I will always have Acne (im 22 now and have suffered from the condition ever since i was 14) Only a few days later I was already starting to notice the difference! The biggest change I saw RIGHT AWAY was the redness was disappearing! And after two weeks I have no new break outs and can see a HUGE difference in my skin! If you were or are like me and tired of thinking you have to live with post-teen/young adult acne you MUST try this kit! Good Luck!"
8629,"Feels light going on, cleans and moisturizes, and doesn't leave residue behind_I really like this product for a few basic reasons - the consistency of the formulation is easily used.  It doesn't come rushing out in a wasteful way, but also lathers easily.  The fragrance is pleasant but unassuming.  I feel like it cleans my hair well, and I can go for a day without using conditioner and don't feel like my hair is straw.Also - this may seem like a small thing, but the shape of the bottle is very easy to handle.  There are times that with wet/soapy hands, I've found other shampoos a challenge to grapple with, but that is not a problem with this product."
1402,Great for my daughter_My daughter has dry patchy skin and this is really helping seal some moisture in. A little product goes a long way. Great product.
3360,Great for a workout!_Love the Buff headbands and half-Buff. Keeps my hair in place and keeps the sweat off my face during vigorous Ashtanga practice. Doesn't stretch out too much like other headbands. They are worth the investment!
4558,"love love love_perfect quality. we make a point to have amateur 'cupping' nights & try new areas or running cupping. light the candles & turn on the massage music - have some fun! as with anything, i think it does help my intense pain with immediate help, but for long term help... time will tell. i just keep trying. don't be afraid of this - it's great for problem areas or chronic pain.edit: the suction connector on this set did break with normal use. we're still able to use it, but it falls off easily. i haven't found a replacement part yet or i'd link it."
4777,"Love the size_I have a lot of hair, and its frizzy.  I straighten it in 3 layers, and with this iron it takes maybe 10 minutes.  I'm amazed.  I've had the Chi before and ones after that took longer because of the smaller ceramic clamps.  I also love how you can control the temp and how fast it heats up.  So glad I bought it."
5918,Fantastic_This is the last curling iron I will ever use. I love this curling iron because of all of the different goodies. First there is the warming pad woohooo sometimes I have to leave quickly and now I can wrap my iron in this and not worry :) second is the temperature control. Looooveee it My hair is so fine I burn easy so this way I can control the temperature :) And the one most important feature is the auto off because I forget to turn it off :(
9486,"great serum!_I love this serum, the bottle looks really high end & the pump makes it easy to use, the serum is great, gets easily absorbed & makes the skin soft & supple"
4147,"This Product Along With Agadir Conditioner, and Masque Is A Great Combo_The Combo repaired my hair as far as it became more manageable, and seemingly even better looking. And I seen positive results after the first usage, and continued results after more usages in which I really didn't need any more treatment after about 3 usages."
7468,"Does what it says it will._The Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm does exactly what it says it'll do; it moisturizes and protects hair, it has a pleasant scent, and the scalp feels better after it's been used.The only thing to warn you about is that this product does not seem made for my particular type of hair; instead, I think if you have much coarser hair than I do, this product would be much better for you than it was for me.  Mostly, I believed this helped me some, but I think it would help someone with very coarse hair far more.But it works, and it does what it says it will, which is why it deserves a four-star rating.Barb Caffrey"
4179,Innovative!_I love the packaging so much! It's adorable and perfect for a young girl just learning makeup. It has everything you need to start out and take with you on the go. Love it!
8817,Lives up to the hype!_The reviews on this all over the net talk about how amazing the color club holo hues line is & they aren't exaggerating. Incredible rainbows with this polish! I can't recommend it enough & I can't stop staring at my nails!
2676,no bubbles_not a fan. the smell is great but sadly this stuff doesn't hold bubbles long at all! I also have to use TONS of it just to get any kind of bubble. Again the smell is lovely but not worth the money for no bubbles
3205,great product_I read collagen and vitamin e oil is good for a facial cream and I have been using it I  like it
4497,Intense Pink_I love NYX lipstick.  The colors are so bold and intense even with a thin layer.  This color is amazing.  It is so bright and bold and really stands out.  It goes on smoothly and evenly and stays on for hours!  The price is great for the quality I almost think it's as good as my MAC lipstick.
4945,Five Stars_Nice color
5630,"Yea_Received the polish today, it's a little darker than what's pictured, otherwise it's perfect! I can't wait to get all the colors."
691,"Beauty_I absolutely love this fragrance.  It is soft, romantic, and feminine.  My husband really enjoys when I wear it! A lovely gift to receive. The bottle is beautifully designed. A welcome addition to my perfume tray. I also enjoy Elizabeth Arden's 'Pretty'!"
1332,"In love with ths product!_What a life changing product for regular or leave in use! Light, but thick enough to quell the frizz, smells great and changes the stexture of your curl in a positive way! Use w no poo conditioner when needed to reduce build up. Simp,y incredible and worth the cost as it is not full of alcohol, chemicals, or water. Lasts a while and it is a product uused daily by two people! Wotks on African Ametican or thick Italian hair."
2572,wierd color_I bought this with high hopes after reading all the 5 star reviews. It made me look weird like a yellowish tone. It did last all day I usually have to reapply I have oily skin but when I looked in the mirror It was such a strange color like I was sick.
4537,"a typical shampoo with a suggestion of green apple fragrance_This is a rather typical shampoo using typical surfactants to cleanse the hair. It has a fragrance which I like...but is reminiscent of less expensive fragrances in cheaper shampoos. Conclusion: a typical shampoo that does the job, but leaves hair no different than others I use"
820,"Fresh out the shower smell, for both F or M_My absolutely favorite CK and has been for quite a while. It's neutral (no overpowering flower smells or anything heavy) and it smells like &#34;fresh out the shower&#34;. Also season-neutral, so it can be worn all year long. Can be worn by either women or men, as it changes when absorbed by the skin."
8186,"Not impressed and bottle too small_Used it during 3 weeks twice a day, it makes skin firmer yet no improvement compared to cheaper brands. Don't recommend it"
9614,"Best wipes for face_I use facial wipes every day and have tried every brand out there.  I tried these Cetaphil wipes and really like them, I like the way they seem to really clean your face and not just wipe the surface makeup off.  When I use these I can feel the tingling on my face and it feels really clean.  With other wipes I sometimes have to use 3 or 4 and with these Cetaphil wipes, one did the trick.  I would recommend these and will buy them again.  These are also great for travel."
1936,Love this stuff!_I got some of this as a gift a last Christmas.  I used it and could see an improvement in my skin after using it for a short time.  I am on the second jar and this product seems to be helping with firming up my skin.  Thumbs up!
8801,perfect for nails_these are perfect for nails!  So many designs can be done if you have the imagination.  I will be back for more of these.
4511,"Konad S10_This plate is adorable! I found that after some practice, I became pretty decent at nail stamping, and I am addicted to it now. I have used all the designs and they look great. I love all the animal designs on this plate."
202,"Great product!_After trying multiple cleansers, scrubs, matte cleansers, and other fancy products,  I tried this soap.  It cleans my face and smells great.  This is now my go to facial soap."
4879,"light moisturizer_Recommended by my dermatologist for my rash-prone skin.  Doesn't leave a sticky or heavy feeling on your face.  Comes in both AM and PM formulas, but I only use once a day so my skin can breath.  Also has SPF protection."
7346,Love_LA Girl Pro Conceal concealer is a great product. It is recommended by a lot of makeup artist. Now I can see why.
7576,"Beuatiful for covering up when highlights are growing out!_I really don't understand the other negative review. I'll tell you, I think this stuff is terrific to spray on my roots when they are growing out...I get an extra couple of weeks between touch ups by my hair stylist. The trick with this product (if you use it as I do for this purpose) is to spray it on your roots, make sure you wait a minute for it to mostly dry, then gently pat it a bit so it looks natural. This actually works very well. From what I read on the can, you should also let it dry before brushing out if you simply want to use it as a dry shampoo, but most people are too impatient to wait and their hair comes out flat rather than fluffy. Be patient, people. Sheesh."
129,very good no sulfate shampoo_A really good shampoo. I have tried other non sulfate shampoos but they either have a smell or don't really lather. So I did not expect the luxurious later of this shampoo. The scent of the hibiscus is very invigorating. Would recommend tis shampoo to daughter for my grandson who has a sensitivity to most shamoos she uses on his hair.
6698,"I love it_This product makes me want to stop shampooing, I love it. I love how it smells and my hair is very clean after using it. I use this as a shampoo, then I put in Giovanni's protein treatment, and then I use it again as a conditioner. I don't use it as a deep conditioner though, no steam cap, just wash it out. I used it once every other week"
954,Rich moisture and smells great._I love that this is dual sided and one side has more of a lotion feel and the other a body butter for those days when a little more moisture is needed. It does take a minute to absorb into the skin so keep that in mind if you are looking for a rub in and go type lotion but for my dry skin the extra minute of absorption time is well worth the wait.
9121,"Surprisingly Pleased_I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  The razors themselves give a smooth, close shave, unlike any disposable razors I have previously used.The trimmer works by gently pulling the hair up, then trimming it, instead of shaving it next to the sensitive skin, thus eliminating the razor burn, prickles or uncomfortable bumps that usually accompany shaving &#34;personal&#34; hair.  My husband used it as well, and also had good results.Overall, we recommend both the razor and the trimmer and would not hesitate to purchase them again."
8939,"works for the average zit but not totally invisible_These work great on a small or even average sized surface acne, but forget about it for the deeper, larger cystic type acne. I used them for a few smaller blemishes and they annihilated most of them over night and even the larger ones were flattened and the redness was almost all gone. My husband used them on his cystic acne and they were not quite as successful... the redness was reduced but it was still bad and would take several covers over several days.They stayed on for a few hours before turning white and falling off. Certainly kept me from picking at it and I couldn't feel the cover while it was on. I don't think they are very concealable under makeup they are just too thick and the edges are obvious, but wearing them at night is perfect."
3593,"Bleaches really well, but note that there's only a small amount in each box_If you're needing to bleach a lot of your hair (going for an all over color), be sure to pick up several boxes. Each box makes a small little bowl of bleach. So even if you have very short hair, you'll probably find you'll need several boxes.I bought this to prep my 13 year old daughter's hair for some Manic Panic colored streaks. We had initially had some colorful extensions put in at the salon, but some of them started falling out the very next day. So we decided just to color the streaks in. She has medium brown hair and in no time at all this Flash Lighting turned her hair into the perfect light blond color. Her hair must have been just the right shade of brown because she had no yellow tones at all in it. I however have super dark brown hair and when I get my hair bleached each month at the salon, I have the typical warm tones in it.I sectioned off a portion of the underside of her hair and applied the Flash Lighting, then folded it up into a foil to keep it separate from the rest of her hair. 10 -15 minutes later she washed it out and she had the perfect non-yellow light blonde section of hair ready for applying color. I applied a dark pink, a violet color and a turquoise blue and wrapped them up in foils. She washed them out later and the color came out amazing. Looked 100 time better than the extensions (which were real-hair extensions too).This Manic Panic Amplified Flash Lighting works really well and fast. Just be sure to get enough so that you don't run short if you're bleaching a lot of hair."
9672,"Great for younger, healthier looking skin._Love that this came with a tiny little jar of Vit C Serum to try with it. Love it! My skin feels amazing! Younger and brighter and I feel like my fine lines and crows feet are disappearing before my eyes! Makes me feel younger and healthier every day that I take it! Great product!"
4180,"Maybelline Mascara_This mascara is great! Does not clump, makes my lashes look longer, and is a great price. Would buy again!"
8482,"Family Fun Testing Axe Gel_I gave this to my handsome 16 year old grandson to try.  He tried the product and his sister said it made his hair look good. My 9 year old grandson decided to join in the fun, and used some gel to make a unicorn horn.  The horn held really good even while sleeping. :)  It took a thorough shampooing to get the gel out in the morning before school. The gel has a noticeable scent so be careful not to use other products with a scent at the same time."
1941,Decent_It's kind of greasy but does the job. I'm a nail biter and this doesn't keep my cuticles in shape as much as I'd like but it's ok. A little goes a very long way so this one ounce size should last for years.
3113,"Aboslutely awful_OMG, this is the worst product I've ever used in my hair (AA, relaxed hair). It doesn't detangle, so in addition to pulling out half your hair after you come it (while it's wet), your hair feels terrible. It was awful. Used it three times and then threw it out."
6414,"Great buy!_I bought 2 of these little guys and they work great, plus they are very affordable. I no longer worry about the kids doing their nails at the table."
4935,"Hair Savior!!_This is truly the best deep conditioner I have used in my life. I half damaged, curly/thick/frizzy/coarse hair.. Basically every woman's nightmare. I use Japanese thermal straightening every 5-6 months, which adds to the damage. My hair is normally extremely dry with tons of split ends. I am also surrounded by Florida's hot and humid weather.. This product turns my hair around. Smells lovely.. Zero build up. Eliminated my dandruff. Softened and moisturized the hair follicle. I barely need to blow dry and the frizzies are all gone. What a deal!! I reccommend this to anyone, especially those with thick or damaged hair. Thank god for WEN!"
7282,"Good Product_I like this product because it is very curl-enducing, but it does cause some dryness and crunchiness.  Make sure to use some good oil like emu or coconut, something really thick before applying this product.  It is good for curl definition and enhancement."
5749,"5 of 5_These have become my go to set of brushes.  You can create and endless amount of looks with this starter set.  The brushes are good quality, clean easy, and can withstand daily wear and tear without any issues.  Slowly but surely these are replacing the others I have in my collection at a fraction of the price."
6855,Perfect for my princess_Look better than the picture! Came within two days and fits perfectly on my one month old. I never write reviews but had to for these. Iam truly happy I brought these after searching for the perfect headbands.
2333,"Ohh La La omg_I love this stuff. I don't do a lot of stuff for my self, but this was the perfect treat for my hair and self confidence. I was thinking it was going go be a small bottle for the price but I was wrong, its a large and tall bottle. The smell is amazing, it smells like a candy shop. My husband (when hugging me) commented on my hair smelling good, and just for that I will forever buy this stuff. Its a lot like palmaide, but better. It smoothes out my mommy fly-aways and regular fly-aways. It makes my hair shinny and shimmery. Its smooth and lightweight, best of all it doesn't over do it in my hair like other products do. My hair never feels greasy, but does feel soft. It comes with cute charms attached to it, you can use them on a charm bracelet or necklace, or like me a keychain."
2326,"Yonka Products - All WONDERFUL!_I came across Yonka during a spa weekend a few years ago and have been using their products almost exclusively ever since.After a serious injury some months ago I was parked in a rehab facility with no chance to go home first so I had absolutely nothing - no clothes, not even my wedding ring. Getting things from home was a challenge as I had to accurately describe what what needed, what it looked like, and where I 'thought' it would be found, then send my husband on a scavenger hunt after a 12 hour work day.Given all this I could only bring myself to ask for one skin care product - so no contest. I opted for the toner as it can be applied after a shower or any time during the day and it leaves anyone's skin glowing, fresh feeling, with no dry or pinched feeling. I started dabbing it under and over the eyes as well. It has a light, pleasant kind of lemon grass smell and just feels good to use.As soon as I started using it, the staff began complimenting me on the improvement in my skin's appearance. They said I look fresh and clean and youthful. I brushed it all off completely as I was gravely ill and assumed the idea was to encourage. However, my husband not only noticed the same things but actually commented about them on his own volition. This guy is a hard care pragmatist so if he doesn't think it he doesn't say it.Bottom line- If stuck on a desert island with only one skin care item, clearly this would be it. I would not suffer from dry, pinched, uncomfortable skin, even if know one were around to appreciate the aesthetic improvements.Truly this is a great product."
1254,"Great Color_I was very skeptical at first with this product at first. I decided to stop spending so much at the salons and getting average results and just do it myself (I consider these fun and exciting weekend projects). After passing this up in the store and contemplating for weeks I finally went for it. The base/all over color was very nice and the conditioner left my hair really soft and silky. It was a little darker than expected at first but over the past few weeks it has lightened up very nicely, especially when you see it in the sun. The highlights I did myself since my mother fell asleep on me, which was scary but not too difficult. I didn't find any of the tools useful and just used my fingers. Next time I will get one of those caps. I think it was left on too long tho, because they came out very orange. But I went to Sally and used an Ash tone semi-permanent to tone down the color and now the highlights look just like the box. I think this will be my new fall color."
3640,"Waste of time and money_I purchased a 3 month supply of this product when it was new to the market back in 2008.  I bought them in England and it was recommended to buy a 3 month supply in order to see any results.I really had to have a good long think about it as it cost 150 pounds, which at the time with the exchange rate was $ 300.  I was desperate, I have such thinning hair due to stress, yo yo weight loss and gain and menopause, that after trying chinese herbs, biotin, Nioxin, etc with no help, I spent this enormous amount of money for a final shot at having some hair again.Nothing.  Not a solitary hair has returned.  I had no side effects from the product at all and they were easy to swallow, but what was not easy to swallow was losing $ 300 and my dream of not being a bald woman before I was even 50.Worthless product for me.  God bless you if it helped you, I am only telling my own experience with it."
9443,"Love this Body Cream!_I generally do like Jergens products, but I really love this BB Body Cream.  It smells very good, and really made my skin feel soft and smooth.  I have seen a slight difference in skin tone, just an overall evening in tone, which is why I only rate it 4 stars.  The skin tone, and other anti-aging effects are hard to see until a product has been used for a while, for me at least a month or more, and I've only used this for about 3 weeks now.  However, I love the way this cream makes my skin feel and smell.  I would definitely recommend it to all and will continue to use this product myself!"
9357,"Best Foot File I've Owned_This foot file is great!  Just as it says, didn't take long to take care of those calluses on the sides of my big toe and on my heel.  I used it both dry and wet, and both ways did well - the dry was best for the worst callused areas though.  This product is flexible and shaped well - it gets to all areas of the foot without strain.  It feels like a really firm sponge if squeezed, but seems to clean easily.  I would definitely buy again if something happened to the first one I received!"
5069,Great Iron_Great iron. Hair is shiney and smooth and I don't burn myself as often with this iron as with other irons.
9921,All natural_my wife has been using this for about 10 days now and she loves the fact that its 100% natural.  she also likes the fact that the softgels are easy on the stomach.  She hasn't noticed any side effects and her skin definitely has a glow to it...she's looking forward to see the long term results.
2485,"Decent lip balm, but disappointed in the scent_I purchased this because I was a huge fan of Shadow & Light's 'Black Tea & Orange Blossom Honey' scent.  The company went out of business and reopened as The Naked Bee, and claimed that they were using the tea/honey scent in their new products.Not so much.  This lip balm smells like bubblegum, and nothing at all like the luscious Black Tea & Honey scent they used to make.  I'm very disappointed."
2413,Boots No7 Night Cream_This cream feels nice and smooth and absorbs quickly.  It's a more scented than I wanted which is the only downside.  I tend to like things unscented or lightly scented.  My skin feels great in the morning.
8863,"Great for fine hair_I love this flat iron- It is a fatter unit and for my thin hair it holds it much better then thinner units- Straightens my hair fast, very impressed with this unit!"
8326,"Teenager a likes It_I was afraid he would not like the child-centric package, but apparently he doesn't care. This has a light kind of fruity scent that he says makes him think of his old nanny ( he still loves her like family) so I like that it gives him pleasant associations.It holds his little faux-hawk perfectly. It looks like it washes out easily, as he isn't the most thorough of groomers and I would know. Great price."
3407,"Excellent Body Lotion For Very Dry Skin_My first thought when I received this lotion was 'What the heck is a sheer infusion body lotion mean?'  I still have no idea but what this bottle doesn't say is that this lotion is excellent for very damaged skin.  I pick at my cuticles until they bleed, tear off the skin and it seems like I constantly have an infection.  After two days of using this lotion my hands have almost completely healed and there is no dry skin to pick at.  My next test is to use it all over my body after my shower because it did such a great job on my hands.I only gave four stars to this review because I do not like the scent.  The scent is a strong floral/musky combination that does not appeal to me but neither does it repulse me.  Scent preferences vary from person to person so I'm sure it will smell fine to most users.My summary:  Buy this lotion now to help you get through the winter months and your skin will be nice and soft when spring arrives."
6413,"Heals my KP, winter itch, and cat scratches... read on!_There are a lot of love it/hate it reviews here and complaints about a formula change. I have a middle of the road view and can't address the formula change since I've never used the lotion until a week ago. So here's my take...for whatever it is worth...I don't generally buy 'drug store' lotions. There are a lot of ingredients I like to avoid and I gravitate towards brands that at least make an effort to use organic ingredients and skin/body friendly formulas. I came across this St. Ives Skin Renewing at my local grocery that was restructuring their store and had this on clearance for two bucks. The ingredient list is largely inoffensive and contains no parabens or pthalates and I was in the middle of a battle with prickly winter skin so I bought it. I've been using this almost daily for a week now and I am *so* close to absolutely loving this lotion. I'm not wild about the scent...it isn't bad, but a little strong for me even though it does dissipate in an hour or so. This healed my winter bumps within 24 hours, something my slew of natural and organic lotions can't seem to do unless I religiously slather it on twice daily. So, hooray...my legs have finally stopped itching. This lotion also leaves my skin BABY SOFT up to and including the keratosis pilaris bumps on my upper arms. The bumps are still there but are significantly less red looking and scaly feeling.Now, this is all very wonderful but not ultimately what compelled me to write a review. I have a couple of cats. One of them has an annoying issue referred to as 'petting induced aggression'. You'll be sitting there with him in your lap, he's purring while being loved on and then suddenly he turns into a flailing bunch of claws and teeth and your forearms are mincemeat. Mostly I can see an episode coming these days and can avoid being scratched but once in a while he still gets me.What is the point of this little story? Well, as I've gotten older (I'm 37) the little kitty scratches, even shallow ones, take longer and longer to heal and are more likely to scar. Our most recent session of 'hey mom, meet my claws' ended with quite a few scratches on my forearms. This happened right about when I started using this new lotion. Now, just a few days later, the scratches have all but disappeared!!! There are some almost imperceptible red lines, but they are just about gone. In less than a week! This is absolutely unheard of for me and I will definitely keep this lotion around because it is clearly doing some good.I'd like to address one more thing: the texture of this lotion. It is a little thick, so if you slather this onto completely dry skin you'll feel somewhat sticky. I put it on after I shower without drying off and then pat myself dry about 10 minutes later. This accomplishes two things: no stickyness and you use less lotion. I come out out of this perfectly soft and happy.Update: Mere hours after writing this review I have to give an update. I think I am now in love with this lotion. I am a Pharmacy Technician and I mix sterile products in a cleanroom. Whenever I go into the cleanroom I have to scrub my hands and arms like a surgeon...past the elbows, harsh soap, etc. I had to do this TWICE today and my arms are STILL SOFT. My hands are somewhat dry because I wash my hands more frequently than I do my cleanroom scrubbing, but they are still in far better shape than they usually are. Love, love, love!!! Am upgrading from 4 stars to 5!!Come on... it only costs a couple of bucks. Maybe it will work this well for you, too."
9594,"Nice shampoo!_Can the effects of this shampoo last for seven days as advertised? In truth, I will probably never be able to answer this question, because I just can't wait that long in between shampoos. However, I did use it every other day for a while, and found the results to be quite nice. In essence, this is a quality product that did (somewhat) reduce the fuzzyness my hair can develop after a while. I used it pre-flat ironing it a bit, and the smooth effect lasted. I did not use conditioner with it, in order to give a real test to the shampoo. Definitely recommended!"
1805,Best Eyelash Curler_It's the best eyelash curler I've ever used.  Does not pinch your eyelids and provides a perfect curl in a short time frame.  Love it!  Don't know why they stopped selling them in stores in the U.S.!
2179,Great lotion_I used this in combination with Paint It Black. I would alternate between the two and I got quite dark. These lotions work well and leave your skin feeling great. I didn't think they were working as expected and felt kind of pale but people kept telling me how dark I was. So I decided to take a picture of myself and wow they were right. I was extremely dark and didn't even realize it.
2442,"A little time consuming, but worth the effort._I haven't read what anyone else had to say about this product. I wanted to write a review on its own merit, especially since my first impression was that this is kind of a 'gimmick' item sold to the image obsessed.  While there may be some truth in the latter portion of that statement, let me simply list the pros and cons. You can decide if you fit into the 'obsessed' category.PROS:It worked, and it did so in only a couple of treatments.The treatments take only a few minutes, but it also takes a few minutes to warm it up, first. Not a big deal if you turn it on before you brush your teeth.It is not painful, but somewhat uncomfortable.  It is a significant amount of heat, but not 'burning' hot. I have very sensitive skin and it left me a little red for only about 15 minutes after treatment. I could easily cover the remaining redness with a thin layer of foundation and powder, no cover-up.It makes large pimples disappear quickly.  I'm talking about the bumps that start out small and stick around for weeks. Usually in inconvenient places. The ones that seldom respond to acne medications.It is small and convenient. Would fit easily into luggage for travel.Could save your face if you had a major event coming up and developed one of the aforementioned blemishes.This is far more comfortable than the shock treatment used in facials and spa settings where blemishes are 'zapped' with low level electricity, feeling a lot like a minor electrical shock.CONS:It isn't exactly 'cheap' but does cost far less than spa treatments and injections by dermatologists (not including the pain of making an appointment and waiting to get in).The replacement cartridges are around $15 and the device can only be used around 75 times before you will need one.If you have a low tolerance for heat, or burn easily, this is not for you.It will cause irritation if used simultaneously with acne medicine.If you have many blemishes, the treatments of 2.5 minutes per blemish could take a significant amount of time, daily. Something to consider.Finally, it tells you on the label that it cannot be used on 'white head' or 'black head' pimples, just the 'headless' kind. For those, it proved to be rather effective, for the others, chemical treatments are preferred.Overall, I gave this 4 stars because it delivers what it promises. I listed the cons/drawbacks and withheld one star because the advertisements don't really tell you in advance what kind of blemishes it does not treat, so someone buying this to treat chronic blackheads (which, by the way is simply very clogged pores and should be treated with an acid-based cleanser) would be disappointed."
4383,Good to Have_I was watching a youtube video on how to keep second day curly styles looking good and I saw that the young lady used a silk scrunchy to put her curls in a ponytail before bed.I've decided to try this to keep less stress off my hair from twisting every night.Really glad I got this scrunchy because it keep my hair in place and it doesn't pull any out. After multiple uses the scrunchy will stretch as my hair grows and have yet to break. I love it!Will definitely recommend this product!
5158,"jo jo baltimore_This lasted a pretty long time, I use it during the daytime on dry areas, and was surprised how effective, but light it was!"
375,"natural blush_this blush is the most amazing I've ever used.. it makes your cheeks look naturaly blushed, very good quality, long lasting"
3482,"Elf Eyebrow Kit_I was extremely impressed with this kit when it arrived. I ordered the kit in Light, and I have naturally dirty blonde hair. This kit for me is just as good as the more expensive brands and pencils you may purchase at Sephora, at least in my opinion. I will say my eyebrows are not sparse, I let them grow out quite a bit before using this and it works great for outlining your eyebrows and filling them in to look fuller. From what I've noticed, it doesn't seem to fade unless you're in the pool where of course it will start to rub off.If you have sparse eyebrows and are trying to draw a good amount to make them fuller, I would not recommend. When I last tried this I noticed it won't stay as well where there is no eyebrow and it ends up just not looking natural."
1887,"Protects color from fading and very gentle on your hair_A few folks on a haircare forum (Curl Talk) recommended this to me when I was asking about moisturizing shampoos. I've been using this now for about a year, and I love how rich it is and how healthy my hair feels after using it. It has a lovely, rose-like scent, and you need just the smallest amount to clean your hair.It's also sulfate- and silicone-free for those following the Curly Girl routine.I have red tones in my hair and red is notorious for fading very quickly, but this definitely extends the vibrancy of my color.Be aware that this is now a newer formulation that has a few different ingredients than the previous version. It still is gentle and works well to protect your color, but it lathers up a a bit more than the older version."
5617,"Lavender sea salt soak_This bath salt contains natural sea salt with lavandin essential oil, glycerin, vitamin E, and aloe vera leaf juice to condition and protect the skin.A handful added to a tub of hot water fills the air with the natural lavender scent, which is very calming.  A long soak soothes tired muscles and leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated.One of the indirect benefits of using bath salts is that they serve as a reminder and encouragement to take the time to soak in a tub for pleasure rather than having a hurried shower just to get clean.  Light a candle, turn down the lights, and listen to music for an experience that soothes the soul as well as the body.A review sample was provided by the San Francisco Salt Company."
4847,"Where is the glitter?_I have almost the whole gelish collection. I am a huge fan of glitter. I love vegas nights, water field, and june bride. Plenty of glitter and sparkle in those but what happened to tumberline violet. I have the same complaint about silver sands but I will write a review on that one. This polish has almost no sparkle. When you put the polish on you only get clear with maybe a few sparkles literally. I do not recommend this at all."
8930,"Headache Inducing Patchouli Explosion_This is a review of the scent of this body mist, not the seller or anything else.I absolutely *hated* it. Based on the notes and positive reviews I read online, I imagined something tropical, coconutty and lovely. Instead I got a heavy, overwhelming and sickening sweet patchouli bomb. I donated it to my local Goodwill the very next day.I have to say, for a body mist it is incredibly strong and long lasting - it wouldn't go away no matter how much I scrubbed.. so I suppose it has to get some points for that. A definite try before you buy."
7288,"Thinner than you think!_These nail tapes are VERY thin, and not all of them seem to be holographic which could be because they are so thin that the effect can't be seen. But given the price they can't be beat. Great for when you need thin, perfectly straight lines."
4888,Love it_This is my favorite straightening cream. Leaves my hair smooth & shiny without weighing it down. The scent is just incredible too.
7033,Must Buy_Great SOAP. I love the smell of the soap. This item isnt HARSH but very creamy that can be used daily.
8584,5 nail glues_Shipping took 3 weeks so if your in a rush I would not recommend.  The item was well packaged and nothing was leaking or damaged. It does what it's suppose to. I use on tips when doing full sets and it's perfect.
2389,There brushes_What can I say they are brushes.  Was I impressed with them no.  I realized that I need a better quality for what I want to use hem for.
8540,Salon Quality without the Salon_I really liked the way this rich shampoo made my hair feel and it had a very pleasant smell. The purpose of this shampoo is to specifically repair damage in hair after 5 uses. This shampoo does rejuvenate hair and make it look more healthy the more you use it. Unfortunately I had no damage to really see if it could be repaired by using this product. It is just a great high quality shampoo with restorative abilities that reminds me of the ones that my wife buys in salons. I recommend.
1487,"Beautiful!!_This blush has become my FAVORITE!!!It is a beautiful, natural peachy/pink color. It looks shimmery in the packaging, but on the skin it's actually not shimmery. To me, it looks like natural skin.The packaging is okay. It's a in a plastic/cardboard container that flips open and close with the help of magnets. It is very thin, but has a lot of product in the container."
6709,WOOOOW!_This makes doing your gel nails at home a breeze! So easy and simply to use and they give the nails a nice shine when they are done drying. This is a must buy!
5351,"Does not show up as green! (phew)_I love anything by e.l.f really so I was excited about this stuff! It really helps you to smooth on makeup and gives you a nice finish, however, it does feel a little slimy when you put it on at first. the feeling does go away but it kind of surprised me. as far as not letting your face get too shiny it isn't amazing for that but i have noticed that my makeup stays put longer with it on than without."
3833,"This is NO Argan oil !_Surprised see ratings close to 5 stars, by so many people!It was the first time that I ordered Argan Oil products. Based on reviews, I ordered this (spray) and (oil) both by Agadir. I also ordered couple bottles of 'pure' Argan oil from another brand.Luckily that I ordered the pure one, along with this Argan by Agadir. So I can say, with certainty, that Agadir products have nothing to do with any Argan oil. And if they do contain Argan, probably no more than 5-10% of the ingredients!I used the 'pure' Argan product, and my hair was transformed from dry, brittle texture into smooth, no frizz, mane of hair. And I only needed to apply 2 or 3 small drops, that's all. That's how strong and effective the pure stuff is.After a week, I put the pure one aside, and started using Agadir spray. What a huge disappointment. This total waste of money, product is not only useless for hair, wish it was!, but actually made my hair look as if damaged. Dry and so brittle. Why? No idea. May be it contains many industrial chemicals! I wonder if the manufacturer can produce certificate showing how much natural ingredients in this spray. Bet you very little, or close to none. Not looking for organic, but anything that is natural, not chemical!Major brands like Garnier, L'Oreal, etc, one finds in any good supermarket, drug store, works wonders on problem hair at fraction of the price. And won't damage your hair. Trusted source!Recommend: buy Pure Argan Oil. Anything else is waste of time/money."
5727,"RUN DON'T WALK_This is the most amazing brush I have found....and believe me I have looked.  It gives great coverage, has never lost hairs on my face (had it for at least a year) and it just smooths out make up perfectly.  I couldn't even begin to put on my make up now without this brush.  I don't actually use tarte foundation, I just love the brush.  I use it with my laura geller balance and brighten or my mally poreless perfection...shhh."
8200,Rc brushes_Good brushes work well very sturdy sheds a little wich is expected of any brushes they r a little long but I like that I wish the smsll white blending brush hsd more bristles yet its s good set I would recamend these brushes 2 u guys and shipping was super fast I recieved them in two days
2662,creamy and smooth_A great bar of soap.  It feels creamy and smooth and makes the skin feel very happy (especially in the winter).  The only thing I don't like is the size of the bar!!  7 oz. is a large bar to hold in a not so large hand!
5294,"Keeps face feeling fresh and clean_I really like this wrinkle repair lotion.  I bought the night lotion and eye lotions as well and they are all fantastic.  I never have the greasy feeling when I am wearing it, and it applies well under make up.  The results are apparent right away.  As mentioned on the bottle, it does make your face tingle.  I could see this as a potential problem for those with sensitive skin.  I will definitely buy again."
5778,Warning_Slimquick products may cause liver-failure...I bought the bottle and found this out and have not touched the pills since. Losing weight may seem like the most important or one of the most important goals of your life at the moment but it is absolutely not worth liver-failure.[...]
4311,"Great moisturizer for every day!_I've been using this moisturizer for years and it has never let me down!  You get a nice big healthy 22oz jug (for under $15!) and it lasts me two to three months.  It has a really nice kiwi scent to it, which is beautiful in spring and summer.  Your skin soaks it up nicely, and there is absolutely NO greasy or oily feeling to it.  I put it on when I get out of the shower at night, and again before I leave for work in the morning and my skin love love looooves it!"
1698,I love it!_It keeps my skin moisturized. I even apply it at the bottom of my feet after shower while my skin is still damp. I will reorder again.
612,"works pretty good and smells nice_but tends to leave a bit of a heavy feel if too much is used. plus its a small bottle, goes quick. i think that my fine curly hair is too picky for this mild product, but its still a good product for different hair, like baby hair or the like."
6432,"I'd give it five stars if I knew..._...that they are going to be making different washing formulations for this. I only have acne when I eat too much chocolate, which is not very often, so I can't see myself keeping this permanently filled with acne cleanser, but I really do like the convenience and sleekness of the dispenser. Yes, there are a lot of soap dispensers coming out now. The company that recognizes that people only want one dispenser (or, at most, two) but they want to be able to change out the types of liquid it dispenses could really have something going on.I've tried the Soothing Plant Extracts one so far, and it feels good on my skin and really cleans. I can tell, though, that it would be a lot better for younger and less dry skin than my sixty-year-old face sports. How nice it would be if they'd release a formulation of cleanser/exfoliator/toner for older skin, too. Or perhaps a third party would make refills for this product.I hope the batteries that came with it last a good while. That would be my only reason for not using this dispenser on a regular basis, if it eats batteries. I can't see that it would, though."
4495,"Love Honey by Marc Jacobs if it's the real deal_I absolutely love honey by Marc Jacobs. I'm hoping it's the real deal. I have been buying, seeing, and reading too many unauthentic perfumes being sold by Amazon. And, frankly, I'm tired of it. If I pay for something I should get exactly what I pay for. Amazon really needs to fix this problem."
3773,"New favorite_I discovered this after a transition to more natural products. First, the smell is amazing. Second, it does wonders for your hair. It is pricey, but oh so worth it."
4754,"awesome_i mix this one and the big sexy hair and back comb my hair and it stays awesome until i was it. during sleeping, working, nights out... its amazing"
3276,works_It works great but does have an unusual smell.  A lot of people complain about it but I actually kind of like it.  I usually use every man jack thickening shampoo and conditioner after I use this so the smell doesn't stay anyways.
7494,"Light_I like this product. I just cut my hair, and I have a teeny, weeny afro (TWA). Since I co-wash my hair daily (some people don't), I put this on my scalp using the tip. I drag it across my scalp in different places while I apply light pressure on the bottle. That way only a little bit at a time comes out of the bottle.Even if you're not black, or don't have 'ethnic' hair, you can use this too, You can use it directly on your scalp the night before you wash it. That allows the oils time to sink into your scalp. OR, you can apply it to the ends of your hair to help prevent split ends. I taught my (Caucasian) roommate this in college. Use it on the ends or use it on your scalp the night before.I do find the oil to be light, but that a little bit goes a long way. I don't use it in the mornings, since, although I have a short haircut, I'm not looking for my hair to be oily - just moisturized."
8267,"Pleasant smell_This lotion smells great and it works quite well without being greasy.  My husband loves it because of these two things.  The pump is nice and does not dispense too much of the product, easy to control quantity.  Dove has changed their look and I have to say I am impressed."
942,"Disappointed!_I researched like crazy and came across this top coat. I agree that it dries fast and looks great, but my nails always chip when I use it! I don't think it protects your color and keeps it for days. I to Essie no chips ahead, which has worked great. I wish this topcoat just didn't make my nails chip!"
8876,"A Good Hair Dryer_This Remington hair dryer works great.  It has three heat settings and two speeds.  I like the feel of the slightly curved handle and my hair dried faster with this hair dryer than with my old one.  With curling irons there is a lot to like or dislike, but with hair dryers if they work, that's all that matters.  I even use the hair dryers supplied in hotel rooms and find them to be okay."
6971,gets some out_this was a great deal that why i got it... it works fairly good it won't take all of the cloged yuky stuff but it gets some out. then the pores are open to clean.
2515,Love this._It's a really great tool. Since loosing this one I bought a kit with a few different types of heads and the ones on this tool are the only useful ones anyway.
5147,Great for smoothing_I love L'Oreal's line of sulfate free shampoos and conditioners. That's an absolute must for me. I have thick hair that's prone to some frizziness. This product definitely helps to tone down the level of frizziness and leaves my hair feeling soft.
2792,"Great for those who don't condition every shampoo_I have middle aged, curly, fine hair that tends to go flat if I use a conditioner with every shampoo.  I like this Aussie Moist shampoo because it gives just a touch of moisture to my hair, which prevents static and flyaways.  I alternate this product with Suave Daily Clarifying shampoo and do a deep conditioning about once a month with Aussie 3-Minute Miracle.All of the Aussie products smell wonderful, are reasonably priced, and give my hair great results.  This 6-pack is a lot less expensive than buying individual bottles at Walmart, and it comes with free shipping."
9406,"Works well on long hair_This works very good on my long hair, as long as I keep it away from my scalp.If I put it too close to my scalp, it can look oily and heavy.  If however, I just rub some of the white creme between my hands, and ONLY apply down on my hair, away from my head, concentrating on my roots, it's one of the most effective smoothing products I've used!It really seems to condition dryer ends and it does a great job with smoothing out frizz and fly-aways.  It leaves my long ends shiny and manageable, and doesn't weigh my hair down at all.The hair on my ends is rather dry and a bit damaged.  Up towards my scalp the hair is in great shape, so that leaves me to suspect that this product is going to be most beneficial for dry or damaged hair.I like it a lot.  I would just caution anyone NOT to use it on their scalp or close to it if that hair is fairly normal.  You might try it before a bit event or important outing.  The first time I used it, I ended up with what looked like an oily patch on the side of my head and I had to rewash my hair.  It does wash out very easily."
9727,"Caress Body Wash, Juicy Escape_This is a nicely scented body wash.  It lathers nice and rinses off well.  The scent on my skin is not too strong and doesn't clash with any perfume or scent I might wear during the day.It's a nice big bottle, which is easy to open, and will last for a while.  Nice product!"
5674,"A Little Dab Will Do Ya!_If you remember that jingle, chances are you might have the need to check out this wrinkle cream...This is really interesting stuff to check out. If you have fine lines and problem areas under your eyes this cream tightens the areas up and for lack of better words, puffs it up. The first time I tried it was at a friend's house and I kept getting the residue after effects that the cream can create if you use too much or if you already have some type of product on your face. For this, I just put some water on a cloth and dabbed it off. I got some and at home, I put it on right out of the shower when I don't have any face cream or make-up on and I just used a tiny bit around my eyes and also a couple of other places. One of the tricks to the product is to not move your face when you first put the cream on. If you have ever used lip plumper, you'll recognize the feeling of the cream. It tightens and seems to plump up areas much like a lip plumper. That's what I thought anyway. After I wait 5 or so minutes for the cream to dry, I put on my make-up as normal and the cream seems to last most of the day.I haven't tried to mix it with make-up but this is a product you can play with and learn as you go. It did get rid of fine lines around my eyes. If you get the residue build up, what I've found is that you've already got some type of product on your face, or you have used too much as it only takes a little, tiny amount, which means your tube will last as well, as long as you just use a little bit. I also used it on fine lines around my mouth and it worked great!This product requires a little patience, well, maybe more than a little, but you've got to work with it a bit to learn how to use it properly and get the best results, but the results are pretty pleasing! It's really an amazing cream. You do feel it tightening and plumping up your skin and it stays on under make-up. Like I said, once I got home and began to use it after I washed my face, I have not experienced the white residue at all. If those fine lines or under eye areas are troubling you, this is definitely worth a shot."
9544,"good body, texture enhancer_Conditioners affect hair differently based on hair type so I will state that my hair is &#34;normal&#34;, very long, thick, wavy, and tends to be soft rather than coarse. My main issues are that my hair can be dull-looking (because I'm 49), have frizzies, and can either blow up to epid bad-hair-band proportions or flatten out so that I lose body and waves depending on the product.The main reason I wanted to try this conditioner was frizz control. I realized that the price I might pay is that it'd flatten out my waves and I'd see less body. Fortunately, that was not the case. It held the natural shape of my hair (which is actually very good and doesn't require curling irons or other assistance), kept good body and seemed to damp down frizzies. I don't have tons of split ends, but I do have some flyaway hair which this seemed to tame.The only points on which this did not excel were shine enhancement (this neither enhanced nor diminished my remaining shine) and combability. I used a fairly modest amoutn on my hair working it into wet hair from the mid-point to the tips and then squeezing the conditioner onto my scalp. Mainly, I'm looking for easier combing near the ends and this didn't quite do as well as I'd hoped on that front. I did have easier comb-out, but I could not smoothly detangle the tips. All in all, especially for the price, this is a solid performer as a conditioner. I'd like to give it 3.5 stars because I think it's not quite as good as Suave's Moroccan Oil infusion (which is my currently low-end favorite), but I think it does rate 4 stars for overall value. It also have a good scent which doesn't linger (whereas the Moroccan Oil is overly perfumey and does stay with your hair all day)."
864,for men_I really love this pedi 2 for gifts and get well looked fast and I love I will continue buying perfumer
944,So long yellow_This really works.  My formerly yellowish salt and pepper hair now looks whiter.  I've tried other products that do not work as well and would highly recommend this product to tone down brassiness and yellow.
9665,"Not Just For Faces_This works really well.  It seems to have a powerful little motor and it does the trick.  I've only had one set of batteries so far and it is still ticking.While I used it on my face, it also worked well to help scrub the dead skin off of my heels.  I used one of those callous removing gels and then after letting it sit, I used this and voila!  Baby soft feet...they still look like Barney Rubble feet, but at least they aren't gnarly anymore.I received this item for free with no obligation to write a review."
4251,for the price!_its a good palette for the price! great for a gift and traveling! eyeshadows are pigmented which is a plus!
4172,"Invigorates Your Skin!_Steam Activated Cleanser by Biore is a good cleaner that works with the steam from your shower. I put the Biore cleanser on my face and washed it off right before the end of my shower and my skin felt so invigorated after I using the cleanser. The only issue that I had with this cleanser was that if you used too much of this cleanser it can cause your face to have a minty like feeling all day. I made the mistake of using too much and when I used my skin toner my face started feeling hot almost to the point that it stung a little, so after that I only use a small amount and haven't had any problems since that time.I love that my skin looks and feels great after I use it and I can tell the difference in the texture of my skin. My pores look better and the Steam Activated Cleanser doesn't dry out my skin. I like that this cleanser cleans my face without drying it out and making my face look much more vibrant a plus for me."
3877,"I use it every night_I've been using this every night for 6 months now, and my skin is softer, firmer, and all my dark spots (from sun exposure and aging) are gone. I couldn't be happier. I use it on my face and hands."
5784,"Palmer's scrub_LOVE the cocoa beans :) they feel so smooth to the skin and it really works! will buy again! also, it moisturizes the skin properly."
1951,"wife ordered this._my wife ordered this and loved it... she was using it a lot because she said her face just wouldnt stop breaking out. she said it was so amazing and it really worked. she said this despite her face breaking out the entire time she was using it. one night after i get home from work she tells me i have to try it with her because the stuff really works... i have naturally good skin and rarely ever break out and if i do its just a couple at most little zits. so i try it and the next day my face is a wreck, like a real break out. it was a disaster... this stuff was breaking out my face, because i tried it again after my face cleared up and it broke out again. it was also breaking out my wifes face but shes such a fan girl of the &#34;healthy alternative&#34; trendy stuff that she swear the gimmicky stuff is doing somethng. made the wife happy but upset at the same time... she was upset that her face was broken out but happy that she had just the product to fix it... although the product causing it was also the same product she thought was fixing it."
6600,"A great range of brushes, but..._I've recently gotten into the trend of doing my own nails and thought this would be a great way to do some fancy accent nail designs. There are a LOT of options in this bundle - different sizes of brush styles and different bristle strengths. I only have two complaints about this product:1) No instruction booklet - how should I care for these when cleaning? What is each brush used for? Unless you're a nail technician already, you'll have a learning curve with this product.2) No angled tweezers - now granted, this is a brush set, but don't you think someone who's buying a product like this would be using other design tools too, like rhinestones or decals? It'd be nice to have a set of tweezers to use here.Other than that, it came quick, is of a decent quality, and appears to have what I need."
1387,LOVE OPI_Almost every product I have purchased that is O.P.I. has been wonderful but this top coat takes the cake. This Top coat is the best of all the top coats I use with wonderful sheen and great drying time.
5503,Love this Conditioner_I also bought the shampoo and I love it. I love the smell of it and how soft it leaves my hair. I also like the fact that I got a big bottle so it will last me a while.
2686,"Not as thick as expected_I had some Neutrogena cream in a similar container several years ago and was hoping that this would be the same thing. It is not. This cream is NOT what you would expect to get in this sort of tub/container. It isn't thick like body butter from The Body Shop (which is more like a soft solid). It's closer to regular lotion from a pump bottle that has been put into a different container. Other than that, it's good. I am sensitive to fragrances, and this does have one. It isn't overpowering though and doesn't bother me unless I put it on my hands right before bed. It does dry quickly and is not greasy. I wouldn't really call it 'deep' moisture, but I have other things to use on really chapped skin."
9663,"Very nice, natural mask_You can really feel the eucalyptus oil when you use this.  The entire time I am wearing it I feel the comforting tingle stimulating blood flow.Bentonite clay; awesome for drawing out impurities.  Glycerin; great for adding moisture.  Shea butter; nourishing to the skin.  Cucumber; relieves inflammation...no cancer causing parabens like some cheap products.This is a really, really nice mask.  I went through an extremely stressful period recently -- my son leaving home -- and my face broke out like a pubescent teenager before the big dance.  This mask soothed and reduced the inflammation and eased the ugliness of the pimple farm I had going on.  My face cleared up and I can feel the elasticity improvement.  I am a fan.It goes on wet and thick but dries pretty quickly and thins out to almost transparent before you wash it off ten minutes later.  It doesn't make your face so tight you can't move your lips like some masks.I received a free sample for trial. I was not compelled to write a review. This is my honest impression of this product."
700,"Does the Job_I had a conair flat iron before this and it was horrible. This one actually makes my hair look like I have super silky glassy smooth &#34;asian&#34; hair (got wavy latina hair) :P I did burn the top of my ear though, and kind of annoying, when you close iron, it only touches at the first half. It also stays super straight until you wash your hair, and I live in Miami! Humidity is not match for the infiniti pro."
9884,"Another Wonderful CeraVe Product_CeraVe makes numerous high rated skin products that it sells at reasonable prices (cleansers, creams, lotions, sunscreen).  I fill everyone's Christmas stockings with these products.  Paula Begoun specifically recommends CeraVe as a good option for baby products because they offer fragrence-free products.  Thus I was anxious to try out the CeraVe Baby Wash on my youngest grandchild.My grandson has thin, light, pale blond hair.  The unscented shampoo cleaned without lathering and left his hair and skin soft and clean.  I will definitely buy again.  Amazon, please add to your Subscribe and Save store."
1221,"Does the job well_This product actually works quite well for fine hair that is very straight and very long... both wet and dry.  (better wet)  I don't see a huge improvement over my favorite detangling brush though.  I see a slight improvement ... but it is an improvement.  I think the best improvement over my tangle tamer brush is less hair loss and as we know hair breakage is damage so that is not good.  That is why I use this after a shampoo and stick to the manual detangler brush when the hair is dry for convenience sake of just tossing that in the purse.  This product does travel well, hold a charge and get you through a rough spot on a trip when you need your hair done.  I got mine for a ridiculously low price here on Amazon so it was worth experimenting with.  Glad I took the chance on it.  Fine straight very long hair is the worst nightmare of tangles in all the hair world. I think if it worked on my hair... it can work for anyone.  I have never had a hairdresser yet who will do my comb out after washing.  So yeah... I think this gadget is worth it to try if you are having problems."
4517,Waste of Money_I was not pleased with these at all.  They didn't work.  Thank goodness I didn't pay and arm and a leg for them.
4791,"It was used when it arrived (A blond hair was captured on the top)- but it works well and I am not going to return it._I am pretty annoyed that I got a used one, it was send in bubblewrap, so no original packaging and I was not inform that this product was second hand- it had scratches in the black plastic parts. Therefore I wanted to take 2 stars of the review, however this would then be a review of the seller and not the product. So the product gets 5 stars. It works well and fast and makes beautiful curls. I love the thing."
2764,"wonderful on my combination and fine hair_I buy this at Marshall's in the large pump size for $12.99, so it's a GREAT value. This conditioner is wonderful for hair like mine that is dry on the ends and oily at the roots. It has no silicone to build up on my hair and the matching SLS-free shampoo is a good complement to it. If I feel I need more moisture, I mix some in a deep moisture recipe I got from the long hair community (snowymoon's moisture treatment, google this, it's AMAZING) and it works wonderfully. A really nice product that makes my thirsty hair soft and shiny, but not heavy and lanky."
999,"Pretty good_i bought this in the benefit sey and it's excellent for contouring and slimming your face, which is what i use it for, but i'm very fair and the bronzer a little too dark for my very fair skin. other than that, nice bronzer."
50,"Just a dab will do ya!_I use this after I wash my face and before I put on makeup.  I use it morning & night in the winter, and at night in the summer, on my face and neck.  It does not take much at all to cover a lot of area. One container lasts me forever!  My brother even uses this in the winter when his skin gets so dry.This doesn't clog my acne-prone pores at all! And works wonders very quickly! (I like to think it also helps me avoid wrinkles!- I haven't gotten any yet!) This moisturizes without that greasy feeling some products can leave you with.  I highly recommend this!1smileycat :-)"
3119,"Incredibly cheap for my favorite perfume!_I love this perfume! It is my go to perfume warm and sensual for winter!. I couldn't believe the price for a 3.4 oz of it! It has lasted a very long time with more to go.  the only downfall is that it doesn't last as long as I would wish, but it smells so good that I will continue buying it, my boyfriend loves it also."
7106,"Best value, best results_I have used Mavala for about 5 years now because it works, plain and simple.  I started looking into eyelash growth treatments 5 years ago,  I've tried Rapid lash, Latisse and Mavala.  The original formula Rapid Lash seemed to work fine,  then i started seeing the advertising for Latisse, so I switched.  Latisse worked, but I couldnt justify the price, its outrageous.  Ultimately I have a routine that works wonders for me..... I use Mavala at night and Lamas Lash Masque during the daytime most days and I use Mavala Protein waterproof masquera when I like a more dramatic look.  This combo of products  support the condition of  and  the growth of my lashes.  All of them were happily purchased from Amazon, of course!"
2704,Smooth as silk_This lotion feels really nice and absorbs quickly into my skin. The bottle is a good size and it isn't overly fragrant. Makes my skin feel silky smooth. Will definitely buy again. One of my fave lotions for sure.
9093,"Nice!_So I just got this wig the other day and am impressed by the quality of this wig! For a fifteen dollar wig it looks very real and very natural. You can get away with it, by fooling everyone it's real hair! The only problem is the bangs! They don't really look like the pictures. If I push the bangs all the way to the side you can see my hair underneath. So if you leave them slightly split it's okay but the thing I don't like is that it makes it looks like you have a mushroom head layer on the top of your head where the bangs are....So the only thing I don't like about this wig are the bangs. The bangs don't really look like the picture, and I purchased the very light blonde one. They don't push all the way to the side, & if they did, this wig would've been perfect."
965,One of the best shampoos_I've used this shampoo for over 15 years; great results; keeps my hair healthy. This is a decent price. It isn't always easy to find -- or people price it very high.
8067,"The smell_My favorite color was the third to the left, the deep magenta one, especially when I layered it over a nice red lipstick. But the smell is something I couldn't get over. It is so strongly scented with chocolate or cocoa, that I ended up giving this away. The colors overall were okay, but I wasn't expecting much to begin with, considering I have a deeper skin tone.Overall this rating is so poor because the colors were just okay and the smell was so horrendous to me."
4074,"nice_not sure why they call her ethnic hair , nothing is ethnic about it, but for a teaching head she works very well her hair is easy to deal with."
873,"Smells like cake!!_I love the smell, not to strong.. It just reminds me of cake, or candy.. Very nice, not over powering, I'd say it's in between a body spray and perfume, meaning the strength of it. I even bought the hair perfume which is nice too, it's not over powering, it's a very light scent, great for people who may wash hair not everyday, like me, gives your hair the smell of like you just washed it. I used to use Pantene I can't find it anymore, I would just pump a little bit in my hand and run my fingers through my hair, it had alcohol in it so it absorbed quickly, so no oil..but it smelled soooo good!! I think it was a type of maybe dry shampoo? I can't even remember it's been so long... But I love this Pink Sugar!!! I got it at Ulta.com for $20 I think it's normally $30. The pink sugar hair perfume is $15 not a big bottle but lasts a long time! It won't make your hair stiff or anything, you just spray a little on after you have put your hair spray on, or say if your going out later at night it refreshes your hair like you just washed it.. Definitely worth trying out. :)"
5877,"Seems to work well_I bought this because my fine hair has been suffering from the harsh winters here in New England, and I wanted to finally see if I could do something to prevent my hair from getting super dry and developing split ends, as it usually does.I had a coupon clipped, so I bought this two-pack for about 3 bucks (awesome!)After I shower, I combine one pump of this along with a small dollop of coconut oil in my hands and work it through the bottoms of my tresses. It dries a little bit greasy-looking, but once I brush out the ends, it looks really great and moisturized. I look forward to seeing how this routine works against the upcoming cold weather."
432,"Very clean feeling_This is a really nice, clean face wash. Don't get near your eyes. It leaves your skin feeling very revived and clean."
1384,"The best light spray out there._This spray can be used as a styling spray (i.e., when you're blow drying) to give a lift at the roots or to add staying power to curls with a round brush.  It is the only spray I've found that you can touch WHILE you are spraying...  to kind of shape the hair where you want it to go.  With most sprays you'd end up with a mess and hair that is all stuck together.  In the summer though, when the humidity is high, I use this spray first, as a shaping spray, and use a heavier, more humidity-resistant spray as a finishing spray."
6059,"great_I bought this for my girl and she really likes it, we had to watch a you tube video on which bottle to use first but works good, her nail look good."
1794,No good. Waste of money!_This stuff is greasy and has made absolutely no change to my skin with regular use. I won't buy any more of this highly-touted oil that does not do what it claims.
1514,"GREAT product_I am so surprised by what a great product this is.  I take meticulous care of my skin, use a good moisturizer daily, get regular facials, and even a few med spa chemical peels this year.  The spa chemical peels were HARSH and actually terrible for my skin.  it burned and flaked for days, and after?  Just about zero difference.I came across this peel in a search for a new skincare product.  My skin is oily in the summer, dry in the winter, and has some uneven redness that I usually cover with foundation.  I've been using this for just a few weeks now and I see a great difference already.  It's not a miracle product but it definitely seems to work.  Just be sure to read the instructions carefully!!  You can only use this product at MOST every 5 days, I would recommend once per week.  Your face should NOT be wet with the product- it almost goes on more like a toner, with a cotton pad wiped across the skin.  You have to be very careful to keep it away from eyes, nostrils and mouth.  And the product shouldn't be left on for more than 8-10 minutes, MUCH less at first.  You have to build up gradually with a product like this.  Start small, rinse off well with lots of cool water, and moisturize immediately.  Avoid any scrubbing within 24 hours of using this- I tend to exfoliate my face like crazy, either with a face scrub or with a washcloth, but the peel exfoliates your skin so any more will result in irritation.  I learned that the hard way!Really worth trying.  I've tried all sorts of skincare products from just about every brand out there: Fresh, Philosophy, Murad, Proactiv, Ole Henriksen, DDF (which is awesome but not for this), Skoah, Dermalogica, Skyn Iceland, etc etc.  This is a far better value and really works, no frills.  I plan to buy the bigger bottle next time!"
7868,"Nice variety_Wheither it's a set of full lashes or single lashes , you have your pick in this assortment. I bought some new excellent adhesive which last longer than Duo, which is what  I usually buy, these will sty on well with that adhesive."
5192,Not for me..._Tried this out on a whim and for me it's just ok. It definitely has a cooling effect which is nice but it didn't add very much coverage. It was also a but cakey on my skin unlike other powder foundations. Will try a few more times but just not for me.
6734,WAY 2MUCH SELF TANNER!_i got this lotion in hopes of it working like the advertisement said.wrong!it stained my feet 0range and ive been tanning for almost a year.the lotion went 0n dry and got dryer!what a mess the smell is like that 80 s selftanner q.t.what a waste 0f m0ney! Pammy D
5374,"amazing deal_I love this. it has a variety of images. the stamps leaves the image very clear with all the details. fast shipping. Thanks,"
401,"USED FOR CONGESTED SKIN_I've been using MD Forte products for 18 months, and have seen a noticeable difference in my skin. I've progressed from Level I to Level III. My dermatologist suggested I use these products containing glycolic acid--not for sun damaged skin--but for congested, combination skin. It works! I often times layer different MD Forte products: lotion, cream, and sunscreen! It works for me! I also use a Clarisonic brush..."
5760,"Great brushes for the price_Overall the brushes are very light, and densely packed.  I like the white tips of the bristles because you can see how dirty the brush is.  I haven't used the case, but it would be very useful when I travel.  I've used the liner brush and liked it.  I've been rolling the brush in a gel liner so that the bristles come to more of a point."
3178,Love this_I'm naturally pretty tan. My skin is a medium beige. I bought this in alabaster to make me look a little more pale. It goes on my skin beautifully and it looks and feels like I'm not wearing makeup.
9902,"love it!_I know this brush is supposed to be for children and I know that it would work great for kids but I really love it just for me! It&#8217;s small so it&#8217;s comfortable in little hands but I think it is really perfect for travel! Even though it is miniature it&#8217;s still comfortable for an adult to hold. I love these brushes, the different length bristles, the feel on my scalp, the fact that you can use them on wet or dry hair, the feel in my hand, just everything. The colors are somewhat different from in the picture; the bristle part of the brush is more of a rich magenta and the back is like a light pink. I received this product free of charge as a part of the Salon Guys Market Research program in exchange for an unbiased review."
7069,"Non-lathering, Non-successful Shampoo_I purchased this shampoo from a salon, after having run through all of the drugstore brands and having no success moisturizing my dry hair. I was sold on the list of healthful ingredients featured on the Perfect 10 bottle.This shampoo did absolutely nothing for my processed hair. It did not lather at all -which I understand that lathering 'friction' can be considered bad for hair...but this shampoo did not leave my hair feeling the slightest bit clean.It did not make my dry hair feel more moisturized.  And it did not smell good.  In fact, it had almost no fragrance at all (which maybe some people might like).I spent almost $25 for this very small bottle of shampoo, and was extremely disappointed. I have since tried Biolage products and Catwalk products that faired better, for less money."
1586,"WOW_I LOVE this foundation! A little goes a long way, covers great, feels light and lasts a long time. Plus this foundation doesn't break me out (i'm 50 and struggle with adult acne - plus need a foundation that doesn't gather in my smile lines.) I went with dark golden and it gives a nice summer healthy glow too."
950,"Love this washcloth!_I bought this product back in January to use at college but when I moved home for the summer, I accidentally left it behind but I'm so ordering another one! I love this because it's sanitary and dries in a couple of hours, it's a cute pink color that satisfies my girlish taste, it fits well in my shower caddy, it can be bunched up or let out to wash every inch of your body, and it's also supposed to be a great exfoliator. It says that it's quite abrasive but I don't find it uncomfortable at all and prefer it to the feel of other washcloths. I feel more clean while using this. As for the exfoliation, I can't be 100% sure if it's a miracle worker because before, I was hoping it would help me with some of my minor skin problems such as tinea versicolor, keratosis pilaris, and some skin discoloration and I haven't really seen a difference in that respect but maybe if I apply some natural products after I'm done washing, it would probably help some more since I heard that skin products/oils when they're freshly exfoliated. Excited to use this washcloth again, I really missed using it."
2010,Blends well!_This foundation sure does fit the description because it blends well and a little goes a long way. I would call this a medium coverage but it is buildable and very moinstrising. It's great for winter dry skin.
3410,"Great lotion for both men and women_Ever since I moved back to Arizona about 10 years ago I have had problems with dry skin on my hands and elbows. I have tried many lotions in the past. Few have worked to my liking, and those that did work did not last long enough. So when the opportunity came about to try Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body lotion, I decided to give it a shot and I am glad that I did. This is a great lotion. As soon as I began rubbing it on to my elbows I could feel the dry skin softening. And my hands felt great as well. Now the real test would be how long would it last. Well in the week that I have been using it I have noticed that after using it in the morning that my hands stayed smooth throughout the day even after washing my hands numerous times. Also I worried that the smell would be too feminine and floral, but that is not the case here. It has a nice fresh and clean smell that is not offensive to those around you. My only problem is not with the item itself, but is with the price. At around $12 a bottle it is pretty expensive but if you can afford it then this is a must buy."
3097,"Not for me_I found the product itself to be dry and difficult to apply, more like a true pencil than the softer material I was expecting.  It smears like crazy and does not last at all.Oh well."
8586,Works great_My husband usually uses Mach 3 Turbo razors but he decided to give these a try. He did not see a difference in his shave with the two extra blades the Schick Hydro offered and his skin seemed just as smooth to me as when he uses the Mach 3. He did however really like the grip of the handle and the hydration strip on these razors.
8622,"Keeps my hair looking healthy_This Nexxus conditioner works well for my hair. I have long hair that I highlight and it's rather fine in texture. I use this conditioner daily on the bottom few inches of my hair. It seems to work well and my hair stays healthy looking between trims.The consistency of the conditioner is nice. It doesn't feel heavy or thick going on and it rinses off completely. The only thing I don't like about this conditioner is the scent. It is floral, which is usually nice, but it is very strong in my opinion. It's not bad after it's rinsed and my hair is dry, but while I'm using it, it's a little too strong for my liking."
1836,Slow to grow hair ? Use this shampoo !! (n_n)_My hair is slow to grow and I always envied the long below your waist line hair I had growing up. But as I got older and cut my hair shorter I found it difficult to grow back the long billowing hair I once had. But when I bought this Length and Strength hair + the conditioner it made hair growth alot quicker. Probably in a month my hair was alot longer than before and my hair is also more manageable and feels healthier. So if you're trying to grow out your hair but it's taking awhile try this shampoo and the conditioner. It will boost your hair growth dramatically !
1067,"Murad is a sold product line_Despite what some say, the product line is consistently good and delivers on it's promise. I wish I could use this exfoliator everyday because each time I use it, my skin glows."
9693,"Makes my hair feel nice, but the look is another thing!_Several months ago, a bad dye job left my hair in horrible shape.  I've been getting it cut every month or two, and I will continue to do so until the damaged part finishes growing out enough to cut it all off.  It doesn't look too bad if I useCLEAR SCALP Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing ShampooandCLEAR SCALP Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner.  It still gets tangled easier than before I damaged it, but the Clear Scalp keeps it manageable.The Dove Dry Oil Conditioner left my hair feeling silky and luxurious -- while I was in the shower.  As soon as my hair dried, the damaged part looked like straw.  I do realize it's my fault for damaging my hair with the bad dye job, but as long as there are other products out there (like the Clear Scalp) that leave my hair looking half-way decent until it grows out enough to cut off the damaged parts, I'll stick with the Clear Scalp."
5507,"I use at least one of these colors every day_I had read so many great reviews about this product that I finally walked over to my nearest Sephora to see what all the fuss was about. Now I know why. The colors are simply perfect for my olive toned skin and hazel eyes and they stay put all day. It also comes with a good brush and a small bottle of lid primer which was nice. Buying it directly from Sephora will save you a bit of money (under $50) and you can try all the colors to see if they're your cup o' tea. There's a Naked 2 palette that's also pretty nice, but I prefer these colors for my skintone. Yes, a few of the colors do have some glitter but I don't think it's overkill. I use the Darkhouse (coppery brown) color as my go to daily eyeliner and Creep (black) for when I want a little more drama. I pretty much use all of the eyeshadow colors in this palette (which rarely happens when you buy a kit) and they are all easy to either amp up or tone down as needed. This is a seriously great buy. Will purchase again when I use it up."
4430,Smells great!_I love the smell of this soap and it cleans great. Nice to know I am not using any harsh chemicals on my skin. Can even be used on the hair!
4803,"LOVE IT!_My hair is not soft at all so I need something really fast and heated to curl my hair. I ordered two different products. One is REVLON's Laser curling iron, one is Remington. I got REVLON's curling iron first, it burned me a lot and the curls cannot be maintained for even a dinner time. I'm returning it. I tried Remington yesterday and I definitely loved it! It comes with a glove and is very easy to use. You won't be burned if you use the glove and be careful. The curls look great. They lasted for a whole night. I really love it!"
604,"Great brush!_I haven't noticed much of a difference in the amount of hair this brush pulls out vs. my old plastic brush, but I was tired of replacing broken brushes all the time.  This one works great, reduces static, and will hopefully last for many years.  I use it on my 19-month-old son, too."
6249,"Works well for both air & heat drying._I purchased this locally and used it in the summer on days where it was too hot to mess with a hair dryer and or any other styling tools.  I would wash and condition my hair as usual.  After patting away the excess water, I let my hair rest for about 10 minutes before applying the product. Then I use my fingers to style and go on my way.  This takes away the frizz and leaves my hair wavy.  It does not make the ends nice and neat. I use a different product for that on the days I use the Sleek & Shine Leave-In.Now that the weather is cooler, I've used this before using the hair dryer and flat iron.  My hair comes out smooth and shiny. The style stays put without any additional product.I do like this formula and would recommend it to others."
8738,"A little drying, but overall a great way to attack zits_This is a fine little scrub that did exactly what I expected it to do:  provide sufficient scrubbing and all that effects with the power to attack acne.  As a scrub, this is what I like in scrubs: scrubby, none of that wussy barely-there exfoliates. This is a product you can truly use to get your face clean and exfoliated.  As for the acne attack, this is quite respectable in the field with enough salicylic acid to work on zits.  As happens with that ingredient, this does tend to leave the face a little dry, but no more than other products of the same type."
2008,Really Nice_I love these colors. The diagram on the back shows how to apply the different colors for a certain look. I am glad I bought it!
7638,Bestest EVER! :)_All jokes aside - this is really a good product - I can't believe that I didn't jump on it sooner! I don't want to get it done professionally - and I hesitated for 1 year before I jumped on this. It is too early to say about stretch marks - but acne for sure gets much better. Your face has never been soooo clean as after a little rubbing with these crystals. I use it all over my body because I am just amazed how soft and smooth my skin can be. I would recommend adding a little bit of good oil if you want a duller exfoliation - and using it with soap if you want a real good rubbing. If you over do it - then you will have redness - so just be kind to your skin. I think it is better to do it often and gentler... These are really dense too - so do not expect a huge package! :) But this will defiantly last you some time... I folk over gladly because it is a good value!
9952,"Awesome eye cream_I really love this product it is so easy to use and I also loved the way its packaged the pump bottle is very easy to control the amount you want to use. This is a gel like cream that really absorbs well . This product has so many great anti aging ingredients in it that I confess I use it on my whole face . For the Price you are not going to be able to find one that's got as much going for it as this one has. That being said you also get the assurance that its really good for your skin and not invasive. it is 75% organic, its not harsh but its still effective . InstaNatural makes really wonderful products for all kinds of skin and hair care. This company really cares for its customers buy providing them with effective yet more natural products for safe use.Have a look at the wonderful ingredients in this product and compare them to others you will see that this eye cream has so much going for it  . shipping is fast and its packaged up really well .I was provided with a free sample of this eye cream so I could make an informed review but my opinions are my own"
7800,LOVE_Really love this eyebrow pencil. LIke how it doesn't come out too dark. Ordered the grayish one. It took a little long getting here bc it shipped all the way from Korea!
9317,"Nice protection, but does it need the scent?_Hawaiian Tropic makes some great sunscreen/skin protection, so I'm happy to see a face lotion in their product line. I own their sunscreen that is similar to this (Silk Hydration) and love it, so of course I tried this out.I shouldn't have been surprised about the 'subtle tropical fragrance'. It's pretty much the same scent as their body sunscreen product, though it seems much more than 'subtle' since you're applying it to your face. Same mix of floral and coconut (or at least to me). Not something that I really want on my face, to be honest. It seems almost overwhelming at first, and I don't know if it fades so much or I just get used to it. Guys, be aware....That said, it's a creamy lotion and it DOES absorb. Not greasy at all. I don't know if they're marketing it as something you can wear beneath makeup, but if you're going to wear it for twelve hours, chances are you may be using it for just days at the beach/pool/outside or you may be using it for sun protection as you go about your normal day. Can say that there doesn't seem to be a problem with the latter. The pump feature is nice to help dispense it, and there's a cap so you can take it in a bag if you and your family are out and need to apply it through the day.I just wish they'd do something about the scent. Does seem odd to give a product such a strong scent, especially if you're applying it to your face. What about people with allergies? Other than that, it's great."
8660,"the deordorant works and doesn't hang around_...but this antiperspirant is a white solid product that goes on smooth.  But I dislike when my husband wears white antiperpirants because they stick to his underarm hair.  The product keeps him dry however.  But he wears it only when he's wearing a shirt all day.  In Florida, that is not often.  I just can't stand those bits of product hanging around. :-("
1841,meh_I like this powder.  I've been wearing for about a week now and its very easily blendable and easy to apply.  Doesn't seem to be making my face break out either-which is always good!
1430,"A Happy Surprise_I love this soap. When I first opened the box I sniffed the soap and I had a sneezing attack. Won't try that again. I've used it for over a month now and I see that my neck and face are getting lighter. I only use it once a day and keep the soap on my neck for 2 minutes then wash it off. This product showed results within one week. Other reviewers stated that it helps clear acne, but I have not noticed any changes on my face. I have oily skin, so after I washed 2 hours later my face would be oily again. I had to stop using the soap on my face because white spots were appearing around my bottom right lip. I will not use on my face again unless it gets tanned from the sun. The first couple of washes did tingle a little bit and my face did itch a little. I recommend this product."
9933,Fantastic serum_I got this to try. I have used this for a few days now and love it.  Not sticky at all and soaks right into my skin.  I can use it under my makeup and can not even tell I am wearing it.  My skin is softer and smoother already.  I love that it also has the vitamin c in it.  Saves me from having to use 2 different products.  This one is truly an all in one.
2295,"Good top coat_Unlike cheaper top coats, the OPI product does not peel as easily, making your home polish last longer.  You get the sheen and the protection, which is all you can ask for in a top coat."
9748,Gorgeous nude!_Wonderfully understated color. Classy and easy to dress up or down. Applies smoothly and doesn't chip. I love this color!
4397,LOVE THIS STUFF!_I Was hearing a lot about this product in Natural Hair Forums and Blogs so I decided to order it also for my Natural Hair and OMG I see what the hype was about it leaves your hair feeling super soft!....In love and will be ordering it again.....Also received the product super fast and was packaged well!...Thanks
9112,"My magic wand_My hair is type 4B / 4C and this iron works like a dream smoothing out my hair from the root to the tip. This is a flat iron that can be a substitute for a curling wand.  It has a great grip so you can control this light-weight iron without slip; and, the swirl cord allows for the fluid movement of the iron. I love that it has digital temperature read out so you can vary the temp which goes up to 450 degrees to suit your needs. This iron heats up very fast too.  It has a power auto shut off capability so you don&#8217;t have to worry if you forget to shut it off.  My last iron was ceramic so I have noticed a difference in the shine of my hair after using this titanium plates iron. I love this iron and recommend it over some of the high end models. I&#8217;m going to get me another one so I have a back up for the future."
9447,"Pretty good_I'm giving this product a four because, although I like the product it does not do all it claims to do. It is a nice moisturizing cream that keeps my skin soft and moist all day. It does not even out the tone of my skin but I really wanted my skin to feel good so I'm pleased.Pros:Good body lotionMild scentLight cream not too greasyCons:Scent is not my favorite, but it's mildDoes not improve skin toneAll in all I do recommend it as a nice body cream."
9606,"This conditioner is fantastic!_I have combination hair, some areas smooth and straight, and other areas thick with body. This conditioner makes my hair uniformly textured, and tames the frizz out of the body. My sister has really thick hair, and she has to have it professionally straightened and thinned. I recommended this product to her and she is thrilled! She can extend the time between expensive treatments by using this conditioner.  This product is intended to be used with a flat iron at home, but I find it has a smoothing/straightening effect with just the heat of a hair dryer (further saving additional wear and tear on my hair).  I highly recommend this conditioner to anyone who has hair with too much frizz, uncontrollable body. You&#8217;ll have less chemical and heat damage to hair and can also avoid the over-limp effects some &#8220;de-frizzing &#8220; conditioners have on your hair. (FYI, I still use a de-frizzing gel after shampooing/conditioning)."
2974,"Wrinkles be gone_I'm not normally one to use lotions like these -- it seems decadent, somehow -- but I am impressed with the results. The skin on my face looks less dry, which makes the small wrinkles I have look less noticeable.The three lotions included in this kit are not at all greasy. They are light and unscented, and blend easily into your skin. I enjoy using these products, and feel comfortable recommending them."
2178,"ok_Most of these reviews are fake, like every other review on amazon /: But this stuff is just like every other tanning lotion that comes in a cool hip bottle. It smells like tanning lotion, nothing special about it. Unless you put the lotion on one leg and not the other to test the results...then you can't say ' It's the best tanning lotion ever!!! '"
4883,One 'n Only Argan Oil Restorative Mask_One 'n Only Argan Oil Restorative Mask makes my hair very soft and it smells heavenly. It has helped me very much when I fried my hair trying to go from pitch black color to my natural ash light brown.
2454,"Luxurious..._Great lotion minus parabin. Nice, mild vanilla fragrance. Everyone in the office loved it. Took it home so it would last longer. Worth buying."
5472,"I bought a brown one from another site and it was one of the best eyeliners I had ever used_This is quite strange. I bought a brown one from another site and it was one of the best eyeliners I had ever used. Very easy to put on, it stayed put and actually helped my lashed grow. However, this particular one- first came in a plastic box that looked like it had been completely ruined due to some sort of heat appied onto the plastic case... I didn't bother to return it because I assumed the product would still work like the old one. I was wrong. It went on very runny and watery. I don't think I can return it without the squished box it came in, but I will try anyway..."
5671,"A waste of money_Not satisfied and definitely regret this purchase. I had to layer on over five coats for a noticeable difference on my lash length. The wand was slightly large, so the lashes would end up on my eyelids when I was applying on my lashes. But the biggest hassle of all was the fact that it was IMPOSSIBLE to remove. There was still a smidgen of mascara on my lashes even when I used my eye makeup remover wipes as well as my cleanser. Several lashes were lost in the process of trying to remove this mascara. Do not recommend when there are better waterproof mascaras out there."
1575,"Continues to Please..._I like this drying in many ways. It is lightweight, it is powerful, has a great retractable cord and that is a huge plus! I hope it lasts a long time."
3683,"Gently cleans and exfoliates_I recently purchased the Mia for my teenage daughter and it's a nice compact size in your hand.  I have owned the Clarisonic Classic for a couple of years now and it's been great.  I have combination skin, dry in some areas and oily in the T zone.  When I use the Clarisonic, it gently exfoliates and helps my skin absorb moisturizers and make up so much better and I use less of it.  I have gifted a few Clarisonics and will continue to recommend this to everyone!"
7910,great quality_i ordered this product semi expecting a low quality bad because of the price. i was very happy when i was proven wrong. it is a great quality purse organizer. very durable. i liked that there was snaps on both sides so that you can make the bag wider or thinner. definitely worth buying.
5468,"Awesome Value!_I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a decent array of eyeliners at an affordable price.  If you like name-brand high quality products, like Urban Decay, etc, this might be a gamble for you.  Personally, I buy my make-up at drug stores and I'm always looking for a great value.These eyeliners are better than the ones I usually get from the drug store - ie. Cover Girl, ELF, Wet'n'Wild, Maybelline, NYC, etc.  They have a nice creamy consistency, not the waxy type, and glide on super easy.  They also sharpen well, granted you do have to be somewhat careful because they are the creamier type.For the price, I am completely impressed with this set.  Each liner is under $1, serious quality for that price point.  The only issue I have is with the color selection.  I can use the black and brown (I've used brown for eyebrows too, no problem), but I typically don't use blues.  If you do use blues, there are several variations which is nice.  The pink, however, is completely useless.  I don't know whose skin this shows up on.  The green worked better than most greens that I have tried in the past.Would be great for a makeup artist, someone into costume or really colorful makeup, etc."
7214,"Snug eye-lids!!_I've been using this several weeks now and love the results it's achieved on my entire eye-area. It's improved from slight crepe-iness and droop to snug, smooth closer to late '30's than cruising mid-50's. Having used the Avon Clinical Duo Eye System for several years it was alarming that the results weren't as satisfying as Time went on, hence I chose this newer eye treatment from the Genics line and've been most satisfied with the results  : )The only bummer is I'll need to alternate the Genics and the Clinical monthly so as not to waste that already opened product but one could say that's a Good problem to have!"
6170,Don't see the value_I really don't get how these are better than a thin pair of gloves. The seams are uncomfortable (especially at the fingertips). I just wasn't impressed.
281,"Great color!_Love this lipstick.  It glides on, keeps my lips moist and the color stains my lips so it lasts for hours."
6911,"nice wig_I bought this wig as a present for my sister, she really liked it and will consider buying a few more."
2116,"learned the hard way...Beware!_Nice color, good texture, doesn't sting the eyes! It doesn't smell funny. Provides good coverage and it's almost like wearing a very light sheer foundation. I pat a little bit of foundation powder on top and good to go.UPDATE: It took me 4 months to realize that this was giving me the worst acne of my life. After 4 months of crazy breakouts I was desperate to clear my skin, so I bought a Proactiv kit to tend to the acne. I never use a toner and Proactiv comes with toner. I had no idea that this sunscreen was so difficult to remove. I had layers on my face from months of not getting it all off. It took me 7 cotton pads with toner to remove all of this sunscreen after washing my face with Proactiv. Imagine months of build-up that was being layered on my face. Yikes! I used the sunscreen the next day (the very last time) so I could wash with the Dove Soap to test out my theory. Yikes again!! It took 6 cotton pads with toner to remove the sunscreen after washing my face. The acne that I have is like no other in my life. Hundreds of clogged pores. Seriously! My skin feels much cleaner and smoother from just 2 days of NOT using this sunscreen. This acne is going to take time to heal. This sunscreen was a complete nightmare. I really hope I don't scar."
4222,Nice Shade_I was pleased when the color arrived and definitely would recommend this to anyone. The price was reasonable and the shipping was swift. Can't wait to try it out on my toes and fingers :)
9362,"This stuff is fantastic!_I simply apply a few drops to my hands to warm up the oil and apply liberally all over my body. The result is fabulously soft skin, and since it&#8217;s purely organic and doubles as a protective mask against harmful UV rays, I also use it on my daughter&#8217;s skin. We both love the nutty aroma.I also use the Argan Oil as a lip moisturizer and an overnight leave-in conditioner, and when I wake up and wash my hair, it&#8217;s softer and shinier.It's super potent and a little goes a long way."
1119,"It does soothe her_When my daughter has a cold, I use this for bath. It does help her and comforts her.  The product is pricey but I do like it"
209,"Nice Product - a Bit Greasy_The Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum is sort of a mixed-use cream. On one hand, it's not the super-expensive use-by-the-drop eye cream that is typically sold in the tiniest bottle on the planet. On the other hand, it's not a more casual face cream that you would slather on your entire face, at least not at the prices they ask for it. This falls somewhere in the middle. It's not meant for near-eye use - Olay has a Regenerist eye lifting serum for that task. Rather, this regenerating serum is meant to be used at other wrinkle spots that don't require the super-special eye cream. Eye skin tissue is VERY delicate - where the wrinkles on your forehead and mouth are not quite so delicate.I use the fragrance free variety, because I don't want anything that near to my nose to be putting off aromas all day long. It is indeed fragrance free, which is nice. I use the serum on my forehead, and under my chin. Those are where, for me, I need the most help keeping my skin in its best shape.The price is of course a down side, but again it's meant for special care; it's not meant to be a full body lotion. You use this where your skin is in need of some TLC and attention. However, having said that, I find that it's just a little too greasy for me. Where the eye serum is wonderfully light and goes great with the delicate eye skin, this serum should have been slightly more thick but with the same grease-free feeling. Instead, I find the greasiness to be uncomfortable on my face. It makes me feel like I need to go wash my face to get the 'slime' off. I therefore only use this at night, when I fall asleep soon afterwards and let the serum nourish my skin until I wake up again.Well recommended, although I'll keep testing lotions in this price range to see if I find something else of similar quality but with a less greasy feel to it."
6564,"Good buy!_These were higher quality than I expected. I like the gradient effect (i.e. Rougher at one end than the other) and I also think 3 is the perfect number. I'm able to keep one in my purse, one in my nail kit at home and one at my work desk. Overall happy with this purchase."
4743,Perfect size_I use this with acetone while doing my own gel nails.  Its great for dipping and cleaning my brushes.  Good value.
1457,"Great Scent_I'm not a perfume person, I've always just did scented body lotions or body sprays. This perfume just smells great though, its light and refreshing and sweet smelling. I have asthma and I can wear this with no problem. The price is a great deal too."
366,"Oh my god._...that's all I can say! This shower gel is out of this world... it smells better than the perfume even, and that's saying a lot!"
9588,"Nice conditioner for scalp and hair_I've tried this alongside the related shampoo, Tresemme Renewal Hair and Scalp Shampoo. I note that I typically use about as much conditioner as I use shampoo in a given shower. So the 8 oz here will last for only 1/3 of the related 24 oz of shampoo. Squeezing the tube of conditioner leads to the product coming out much like an ointment as opposed to a liquid. Nevertheless, it goes into the hair easily and can be left on the scalp for a few minutes as directed without just pouring off your head. The product washes out easily at the end of the shower and leaves hair soft and scalp feeling clean and without dandruff (thanks to the tea tree oil, I suspect)."
2396,Works well_I really like this shampoo and conditioner alot. They both smell so good and your hair feels so soft and shiny after using them. This shampoo/conditioner cleans your hair without weighing it down at all. I plan on using this all the time..i love it!
5917,"Works Well_John Frieda JF 1 Full Volume Hair Dryer works very well. Nice looking, too. 5 not 5 stars because it is LOUD. Beyond that, lightweight, dries hair quickly and feels nice in the hand. Recommend."
6834,"Very Good!_I've had a hard time finding hair products for my short, natural, kinky hair that doesn't weigh my hair down or look and feel greasy.  This product is exactly what I need.  The oil is light, and I only need to apply a little on my hair.  Another reviewer is right - apply to wet hair for best results.  I found this product at Walmart while looking for a different hair product.  Lucky find."
1397,Best Top Coat but bottle drys up fast!_I have use every topcoat out there and one day in a nail salon the tech whiped out this bad boy and for two weeks my nails stayed glossy and chip free.Honestly this top cost is the best I have ever seen.  The shine just lasts and lasts.  When it does get dull you do not need to reapply simply take an alchol pad and wipe the top of your nails down.  It reminds me of a gel without having to sit under the heat lamp.The downside?  It drys up FAST!  If you do not tightly close this bottle up you will find it becoming too thick to use.  Not even adding a touch of polish remover saves it the only thing you van do is get another bottle.  This could be because i live in the mountains and everything dries up fast here but I sent a bottle to my mother to try and after 3 weeks hers was unuseable as she could not close it tight enough.
79,"Pretty color!_Softsilver Red is a light strawberry red with silver shimmer. Has a little bit of pink and hints of coral too. Very pretty color. I actually like this color so much, I have it on autoship.  :)."
8347,"Reliable shave_The gel easily turns into a thick, satisfying foam that softened even my bristly beard. The razor glides easily on top. I don't generally have sensitive skin so I can't comment on that aspect but I like that it is practically without a smell."
4531,"Tames Gray Hair Frizzy_I have straight hair but as I have gotten older I have started to get gray hairs that stand up on top of my head and make my previously silky & straight hair look dry & frizzy. I decided to give this a try and love the results! The gray hairs are easier to smooth down and look less kinky and more like regular hair. My hair feels great to the touch, very silky. The fragrance is very nice and the conditioner is very thick. It is definitely 5 stars for the price and ease of being able to pick it up at the drug store."
9823,"plumps fine lines_I use this for my forehead as I have some lines and wrinkles across it, and it has helped greatly in plumping it out and getting rid of them."
1095,Perfume:_The wife just loves this product and uses it often.  I will definitely replace it with the same the next time she needs such.
5387,Smooth Shave_I've tried other disposables on the market. Some of them are just dreadful. This razor is good quality for the price and gives you a smooth shave. The blade seems to stay sharp for a good while. It helps if you keep it dry when not in use. If you're looking to try out a new disposable give these a try.
8229,Perfect!_I used this and their shea butter to make my own lotion. This smells wonderful! I love it. I will buy it again.
5936,wont work_Never could get on right.  Gave them to my granddaughter..  She loves wearing them and Her friends enjoy them too.
8921,So many colors_I give this item five stars because of all the different colors I'm so glad I found them and a great price so if I were u I would defanitly purshase this
7400,"Obsessed_This stuff is so awesome.  I just start using it - it leaves my hair silky smooth, and it gives it that 'mirror look' that you see on women with super healthy hair.  A little goes a long way!"
7894,Great Deal_Just as described. These are fun beads to use to decorate your nails or what ever else you might have in mind. They each come in a nice little container for storage. What more could you want.
6875,"worth the price_nice well packaged. It is a stocking stuffer, so I haven't used them. The brushes seem firmly attached and look like a quality product"
8771,"Good care for your hair_I've been using the Dove Color Care Daily Treatment Conditioner for about a week and I'm very happy with it. I need a product that helps take care of the color in my hair while also nourishing my naturally curly, fine, long locks. I've tried dozens of conditioners over the years. The Dove works well, is affordable, and leaves my hair shiny and manageable without making it feel like it's got product residue in it. It seems to be doing a good job of taking care of my color, as well as taking care of my hair. It applies evenly throughout my hair and rinses out cleanly, unlike many other 'treatment' products, and it smells great too."
9194,Excited_I received them on a few days ago and I am excited to use them this weekend. They are beautiful colors.
8265,"Nice, light lotion, covers well - mild scent_A couple of dabs will do it - I used about a 3/8' spot and it took care of my face and forehead.  Spreads evenly and id non-greasy. I would prefer unscented - I put it on about an hour ago, and can still smell it. Not bad, but it's there.  It absorbs quickly, and about after 30 minutes I can't see that it's there (There is a slight 'sheen' for a while.) If I rub my skin, I can tell I have lotion on, and my finger tips come away with a little lotion on them.It's a great lotion, moisturizes well, and I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the long-lasting scent.  Nobody else can smell it, but I can."
2571,"cheap_I guess you really get what you pay for.... So, I got crap! I ended up giving them to my kids to play with."
7227,"Doesnt work with IBD gel polish._I used it with &#34;IBD gel polish- LED/UV&#34;. I spent half an hour with my hand in it and it was still sticky- it didnt work. Then I applied a top coat of Gelish on my nails and it finally worked...some. Nails finally dried, but they chipped next day, so they weren't properly cured.I'm not saying the product is bad, it just didn't work with the IBD gel.Make sure this particular lamp works with your favorite gel polish, they do mention some brands in the product description that are not compatible with it."
475,"My new favorite brush!!_This brush is nicely balanced. I like that it has the metal under the bristles that will hold the heat to help style my hair when blow drying.  I can get my hair straighter with this brush! The bristles are fabulous! Soft but feel good on the scalp, protected ends as not to tare your hair or your scalp.  Excellent brush!!!"
7983,"broke me out_While this serum seemed to plump up my skin in a few days, it also made e break out horribly. Left it alone, and tried it a few weeks later, after my breakut was healed. Two days of using it and I break out all over again. Definitely not for me."
1869,"Bodacious and Beautiful_If you shrink from bold, sexy scents, don't try Euphoria. Euphoria EDP starts slightly sweet and fruity, but not sickly, and mellows over time to a woodsy-floral scent with earthy notes. I thought I detected amber in the dry-down. The scent is seductive and appropriate for evening wear.Perfumes tend to die on me within hours but Euphoria lasts for several hours. My fiance' could smell it on me four hours after application. He adores the scent."
7192,"My wife loves this...._Got this for my wife at Christmas a stocking stuffer.... she loves it and it smells great.  It's definitely cucumber scent, but really also has a melon scent to it as well."
6997,32 Pcs Black Rod Makeup Brush Cosmetic Set Kit with Case_These are beautiful makeup brushes. The price is fantastic. I was amazed at the number of different brushes. You can't beat this price. Thank you.
2872,Works but does burn my skin a little._I am currently using acne medication and needed a strong sunblock to wear during the day.  I like that this sunblock is a tiny bit white because it helps tone down the redness in my skin from the medications.  If I use this on my skin after the medications it does burn parts of my face for a few minutes then goes away.  It leaves my face a bit shiny and greasy.  I like that it is unscented but there may be better products out there.
1106,Smells and works great_This body wash works very well and smells great. It lasts a long time as well because you do not have to use a ton of it.
5992,"Every night for best skin_I just love a clean face!!  Makes my face feel so clean, like I really have gotten any and all make-up and dirt off."
30,"Great for spot treatment_I am using acne kit from acne.org.  i got this to compliment that kit.  I use this once week, but mainly for spot treatments.  As soon as i feel a zit coming i apply this to it few times through out day and zit never really makes it starts healing away right away.  Great lotion.  And for spot treatment this bottle will last for years."
1830,"Crispy Crunchy_I'm not sure why I've had such a different experience than many of the other reviewers, but this product left my hair dry and crispy, not good at all.  The one I recieved is the newer 'Crulesque' bottle."
5588,"A great to go product_I love benefit's benetint. This product has the original color, and a Posietint (which is a lighter pinkish color), and High Beam, (which is a shimmer highlighter). I love the size of these. They hold quite a lot, as you don't need much, just the right size for my makeup bag or just to toss in my purse, no need to worry about leakage). I will try more of their colors now. I love the high beam to highlight my brow bone."
9936,NICE_NICE PRODUCT LIKE AAA
4056,Love the scent_This is such a nice fragrance that I wear it even in the winter. I get compliments all the time and asked what that fragrance is.
811,"Helped Nails, Not Hair, and Maybe Caused Hair Loss?_My doctor suggested I take a daily biotin supplement to help my slow-growing hair. I used this particular product for two full months, and here's my experience: Initially, I started with 1 pill, but it didn't seem enough (due to research, which says 10,000mcg is better), so I increased my daily dosage to 2 pills. I can say for certain that my nails grew like CRAZY with this supplement. But, it didn't help the hair on my head in ANY way, though it made my skin extra smooth. Here's the caveat: I have noticed some body hair loss on the arms/legs, which concerns me - that's not normal. So while I think this may not necessarily be a bad supplement, I am re-thinking taking more of it (or Biotin altogether) due to the body hair loss.**UPDATE (April 3, 2011): I have decided to STOP taking this Biotin supplement because I have noticed more body hair loss on my arms, which I never had before. Now that I've stopped for a week, there are tiny hairs growing back out, but they are very fine. Not sure if this is my individual reaction to this product, or to Biotin in general, but it is best not to take it further. The hair on my head does not seem to be affected one way/another with this supplement (or perhaps I lost more being on it!), but my nail growth has slowed down (which is okay). Now it makes me wonder about the quality of the product, or biotin in general,...because it's supposed to make your hair grow, not cause hair loss.**UPDATE (June 11, 2011): The hair on my body is nearly back to normal since I stopped taking this supplement. Not sure if it's the quality of the ingredients in this particular brand or biotin in general, but it caused patchy body hair loss all over. Now I'm certain it was the biotin because 3 months later, the hair that was gone on my body is back! The supplement may not affect everyone in the same way, but it definitely does have side effects for some of us.**UPDATE (December 17, 2012): I just found out that biotin INCREASES testosterone in the body. That makes total sense that many who have taken biotin in the hopes of decreasing head hair loss have instead ended up with body hair growth and cystic acne instead (a definite sign of excess testosterone in the body). I believe the whole 'biotin will increase hair growth on the head' is a marketing scheme that even physicians are buying into without doing their research. Do not recommend for hair growth!"
644,"Great_I love this base coat, it serves its purpose and my mani usually lasts around 4 days with no chips."
7126,"Definitely mattifies!_I really like this product. It keeps my oily face shine free for about 5-6 hours.A tip, use very little product. If you use a lot, then this product won't work very well."
5337,"Sheer alright!_I have tanner skin so I was a little worried that the &#34;sheer&#34; would not be as sheer as it portrays, however, this eye lid primer is pretty awesome.It actually goes on sheer believe it or not! When you first apply it it is like a light creamy rich vanilla color but once you blend it over your lid, it becomes invisible so you can freely apply your lid make up.So far I love it, I have tapered lids, so I have a bit of a problem with creasing make up, but once i apply this primer and my make up, my make up lasts for hours with no problem.Also, I use a lot of liquid eyeliner for my day-to-day look and with liquid eyeliner, it doesn't settle well directly  on the lid it needs something to &#34;grab&#34; like powdered eye shadow, but with the eyelid primer it grabs nicely with no added eyed shadow so I can go with a more casual look.Over all, I recommend."
7815,Nice for practice. Not professional quality but they work._excellent for the price.  I bought these for practice and for my middle school art club who is learning nail art.
6869,Perfect_These are great.. gets the job done and they are perfect for what i needed no need on getting the really expensive ones
784,Very handy!_I love these jars! I use them for my whipped she butter! They are big and easy to store. I also got them fairly quick.
2251,Large Size_I just need acne treatment and this was large so I bought it.Pumping make it easier...and I like that.
2617,"Good Straightener, Easy Storage_I was excited to receive the Tresemme Phillips Thermal Creations 1' Straightener. I have long, wavy, thick hair that can be hard to manage so I wanted to give this product a try.Upon opening the box, I was happy to see the heat-resistant pouch included, which is very nice with a nice fit for the straightener. I was also happy to see the Tresemme Hair Protector product which smells wonderful, just spray on your hair to protect it from heat damage.The straightener itself is a nice shape and size, comfortable to use. It is a digital model which has three buttons, for on/off, up and down and a digital read-out that tells the temperature and if it is ready or not. The straightener also has a locking mechanism that keeps the plates together for storage and lets the straightener heat up faster when in locked position.After plugging up the straightener, it has a quick, 30-second heat-up with a ready indicator read out. Upon using the straightener, it worked great, leaving my hair smooth and shiny. I deducted one star because the button controls are on top of the straightener where I was holding the straightener and my hand kept accidentally adjusting the heat setting. After awhile, I did learn to keep my hand off the button but it deserved a one star deduction for the hassle.Overall, I am pleased with the product. The features that set this product apart from others for me, are the locking feature, which is nice for storage and I really love the storage bag. Now its easy to put up my still warm straightener and no more loose cords everywhere."
8825,"Very nice product_I purchased this product because Amazon recommended to buy it with my Konjac sponge for face. I read a lot of reviews about it and i decided to give it a try. I had very itchy back and I used to use those hard sponges on the stick to scratch my back. It was horrible and painful, it seems like every time i would scratch my back it would itch more and hurt more from that harsh sponge...so i decided to give it a try and buy this Konjac sponge for body. When i got it, i washed with it for 3 days and already my back stopped itching..It soaps really nice and my skin became really soft and less bumpy around my arms and my back. I've been using it for over 2 weeks and I love it.. My husband even surprised when i don't ask him any more to itch my back...:) I'm very satisfied with this product. The only one thing that this sponge need is a string to hang it, but otherwise it is a very good sponge to have if you have dry and itchy skin..."
8833,"Much Better Than Photo_This hair clip is a good size, perhaps about 5&#34; and I was surprised by how sparkly it is. It really looks good under bright lights, and has a clip which seems strong enough to hold my thick hair. Prettier and more sparkly than the picture shows."
9852,"Great Straightener, Anti Frizz in humidity?  Probably not._I have an old ceramic Wigo flat iron and wanted to try this Remington flat iron in the same size.  I do like that you can alter the temperature based on your hair type.  Mine is thick and course (never quite curly but always frizzy) so I set it to almost the highest temperature at 425.  It on truly only took 30 seconds to heat up.  I felt that it did a good job straightening my hair.  It took several passes over each section of my hair to become straight.  I do like the finger indents so you keep your fingers from burning when applying pressure.  I don't think this does anything for anti frizz.  We live in Las Vegas where the weather is dry and I don't have to worry about my hair frizzing due to humidity. But I can guarantee that if we lived in the south and I used this, my hair would be frizzy!  If you want a flat iron without spending as much money I would recommend the Wigo with ceramic plates.  If you want to control the temperature for your hair type look into this Remington."
5908,These Facial Wipes are my favorite_I'm addicted to these Equate Clean Facial Cleansing Towelettes.  I haven't found anything that worked as well.  They effectively remove makeup and grime and have a clean scent that isn't overpowering.  Plus they have an affordable price!  I'll be ordering more for sure.
9890,"Stylish bottle with perfect mist_This is a great product that I would definitely recommend if you're in need of a spray bottle! I use it for styling my hair and it lets out a perfect mist (I'm not sure how to describe perfect mist - the right amount of liquid? 'Misty' enough?). Regardless, the mist was fine and in a large enough quantity to cover the area I wanted to. It's also a very stylish spray bottle and it fits into my hand very comfortably. I received this product as part of Salon Guy's Market Research Program, in exchange for my unbiased review of the product."
517,The Best!_My hair doesnt do too much.. or if it does it doesnt last. I have an older version of this and its AMAZING!My hair is long and thick. I dont like blow drying it because it makes my hair all frizzy and then i have to put so much product in its ridulous.This heats up quick.. within 2 min id say on the hottest setting. I can straighten and dry in 20min max with only 1 product in my hair so its still light and fluffy.You can do dry OR damp OR wet hair theres really a setting for from dry to wet and everything in between. Def recommend!!
1066,"Good Exfoilator_I've been using Murad products for years.  This is a great Exfoilator.  Nice pleasant smell and not rough on your skin.  I use it every few days and always like how my skin looks and feels.  I like that its a flip top, squeeze bottle.  A little goes a long way."
709,"Non-irritating, non drying, and a great value_I have been using this for years at night.  (In the morning I use Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant.)  The combination of these two seem to work  for me and I have fewer blemishes now than ever.  Other products that I have tried have been too irritating or drying.  When I was younger I needed a cleanser that would reduce the oil but now I have skin that is getting dry, and yet I still have occasional blemishes.  Finding a product that would not break out my skin but not strip it either  was a challenge.  The Purpose Cleanser is the closest I have come to meeting both objectives.  I also like the  fact that there is no scent."
5956,Very Nice!_I use this everyday and it is especially great after you have used Retin A and your are all flaky.  It smooths out the peeling really fast.  Thank you.
2576,"Great Price, Great Product_Obagi can be very expensive when you are doing the total program.  I searched Amazon and this was the best price for this product."
4500,"This is great!_One of the reasons I don't like head wraps is because they never fit well and the slide off during the night. I decided to try this one after reading the product description. This wrap offers the best coverage, is silky smooth yet doesn't slide off. I will buy several more."
8113,"It doesn't do much of anything for my hair_This item was given to me for my review.Cristophe Professional Volumizing Spray was difficult for me to even push the atomizer button. That might change with use, but I have tried it several times, and it still takes both hands. The spray comes out as a fine mist, which I really liked. The scent is almost nonexistent, and I really liked that, as well, but the product does not seem to work on my hair. My hair is fine, but I have a lot of it, and this volumizing spray did not provide volume or really hold my hair. It is possible that it might work best on fine, thin hair, but that's not me."
8099,"A terrific product!_I've had a few opportunities  to try out this product, and it works well. A pleasant smell, and non greasy application. We mow a couple of acres, and spend time at the pool, and i am usually well burned this time of the year. But not this year. I'm well pleased with the performance of this product, as we always have been with Banana  Boat products."
7997,I Love It_If your looking for a whole kit don't buy this one. This one is basically for practice if your a starter. It only comes with a few nails & noneof them are the same. Over all this was a good deal.
7507,"Best thing to ever happen to me!!_A friend of mine took me to get a gel mani and I fell in love! I quickly realized that with a bit of effort I could do it at home so i bought this kit. I am a licensed esthetician and I can buy this product at a professional beauty supply not open to the public BUT the price is surprisingly WAY more expensive there. I have done over 10 manis on friends and myself so far and everybody loves Gelish. My collection is expanding rapidly, 15 colors so far!"
1288,"Up Front& Personal by OPI_Hi every one this is Sara-I just got my new nude nail polish by O.P.I, it's called Up front & Personal. I love it great for the Holidays I think. maybe you want to use it to be casual but a Little spice. Nice for the Holidays maybe going to some parties or something.... I don't know. I had to apply 2 to 3 coats and I got the results that I wanted. I do have Olive Skin and it was a great complement to it. Amazon did do a great packaging job to it. I got a quick delivery faster then what they had guessed."
9145,Great overnight 'fix'_I have been ordering these for about a year and realy like how they work.  Will continue to reorder when these are gone.
2263,Work great..._These gloves work wonders on exfoliating in the shower.  Just plop some body wash or scrub on them and go at it!  It is so much easier than loading up a bath scrubbier - since you are just basically using your hands!
3487,"Good brush_Make up brushes can be so expensive, but I found this one @ target for $3.00, and it's a very decent brush! However, the first one I purchased the hairs came out almost immediately; complained and it was replaced. This one I've had for a months now and it's perfectly fine. Works great. I like it just as much as the brush I had before that I paid $25.00I'd really suggest this brush for someone on a budget, it's not top of the line, but it gets the job done!!!!!"
9940,"Great_I love Dead Sea Salt Deep hair conditioner. My hair always feels so nice when it dries after using. I've never really been one to use conditioner in my hair since it tends to weigh it down BUT, using this once a week; sometimes make makes my hair feel SO good! i love it."
1452,"Burberry's Best Scent..._I have tried all of Burberry's fragrances for men and this one is my favorite.  It is a very sophisticated scent that continues to unfurl hours after application. I must say I believe this would classify as a mature fragrance.  I have also noticed, like many fragrances, London responds very well to heat.  Many people have complained about its longevity.  Apply it after you shower to the chest and throat along the back of your jawline, then go out.  I always receive compliments from women when I wear this cologne and more than one have complimented on masculine presence.  I find this cologne is best appreciated during the evening in the colder months of the year.  However I have also worn it during the summer where the heat and humidity help bring it out.  Buy with confidence from Amazon and not a third party seller."
8025,"Good product for curly girls. A little goes a long way. Does have a fabric softener smell._I was intrigued by Miss Jessie's products since there is so much hype around them. I'm Caucasian and have naturally curly hair. As other &#34;curly girls&#34; will understand, I regularly have to layer 3-4 products to get my curls &#34;right&#34;. Even though the bottle says to apply generously, I think you should use this product with a light-hand or it does build up. It creates more of a loose curl. I think this would be great for women w/ wavy hair."
3298,Especially great for dry skin._I had been looking for an oil based cleanser because my face can get very dry.  The DHC egoes on as oil but creates a cleansing lather that removes the oil  for a clean feeling face.
3515,Nope_The brushes from this product broke me out. I don't know if it is because the brush is rough but it was a problem for my skin.
8151,Great Product!_I bought this because I have had a bad couple months with acne. I was hoping that it would be a miracle mask. I don't think its a miracle mask but it did seriously help my skin. It been two weeks of using it every couple days and its turning my skin back to its original bright and beautiful self. It is very drying but I just compensate the dryness with some oil on the face and it evens it out. I would definitely recommend this product!! Worth the money!!
7313,"Follow directions._It's fine but not enough in the can for the money. And, be careful not to get it on your scalp. Won't look realistic."
1139,"good price, better than expensive!_Okay so I have very FINE BLONDE hair, dyed, and straightened/curled/whathaveyou every day. I can't afford to not protect my breakable hear, and i can't afford to buy the products from salons.I am always trying different protectors and have had my way with fairly nice sprays. What it comes down to, once i adjusted to the way this (and frankly most...) protectors are, watery (opposed to the hairspray-like salone protection i used)its my go-to when i'm low and dont have much money. its about three to four dollars so i just stock up when i can and itll last me a fair while...for the price, and its effectablility i give it a five. I would recommend this. However, there are better out there."
5527,"Say 'Wow' with your eyes!!_I love this stuff!  When you use the white the colors of your eyeshadow just POP!  It also has some amazing staying power too.  I haven't tried the pearl one yet, but I am sure I will love it too!  Thank you RuPaul's Drag Race for featuring Nyx cosmetics!!  Do you remember they gave a lifetime supply to the Queen who won...Wish it had been me!  I love all of the Nxy products that I have tried...I highly recommend this set of primers to anyone who wants to say &#34;WOW&#34; with their eyes!!"
874,"The Best Perfume Around!_I absolutely LOVE this perfume, and will not be needing to look for a new one any time soon. Every time I have ordered it from Amazon, it has come within the specified time frame and I have never had any problems. My boyfriend loves this scent and always comments on how nice it smells."
5211,"Very good_The colors are cool and not common or loud, love this. This are my favorite colors, and would buy more"
3022,Good product_I used these when I was younger and loved them. But they will work differently for everyone depending on the hair type. It may even work differently for me since I used them last. My hair is super hard to curl  now and it wasn't when I was younger.Only problem I had when I was younger was the foam will eventually break down so you can not wrap the hair too tight around it.Looking forward to trying these out tonight to see if they still work as well as they did when I was little.The product was shipped very fast. Delivered on January 2nd instead of the estimated Jan 4.
8874,"Great price, great product!_This is a wonderful product for the price!  It is a great looking flat iron with quick heat up time and a very hot temperature.  There is auto shut off after 60 minutes (which I need!) and a temperature lock, which is the first time I've been able to control that on a flat iron.  It has a great width, is easy to use, and glides smoothly through my hair without causing frizz.  And I have very long hair.  (I do use styling product as well.)There really are no cons; but some other reviewer mentioned that you do need to hold the off button for a bit to get it to shut down and I found that to be true as well."
8860,"Easy for a newbie_I've never tried a home haircut kit. The Remington HC5850 is a piece of cake for someone who has no prior experience.It comes in a black plastic 'clam shell' box so you'll never lose any of the pieces.  Everything stays together.  There are 8 comb guide attachments, so you can trim from 1/8' - 1' - plus the plain 'baldo' trimmer (no attachment).  They are very secure so No America's Funniest video material.If you're working on longer hair, you can hold the hair out straight and clip the ends off.  It's Very versatile.The kit also includes a cape!  Scissors, a brush, blade guard and lubricating oil.The clipper is very sharp and didn't pull hair as it was cutting.  It's comfortable in my hand and easy to balance for a great cut.I'll use it again for a freshen up cut.  Why spend money on a full hair cut when a trim is all that's needed?It's also easy to clean after use.It's a great way to get a fresh haircut - at your own convenience.I'd recommend the Remington HC5850 to anyone who has growing hair."
2811,Good Clean Feeling_I can no longer use this because it does dry my cheeks out too bad but it does control acne very well and cleans my shave area very well (I am guy). It foams very well and lasts long enough for you to get a good cleaning. It does make my face feel tight but I actually like that. I would advise someone who has used traditional acne cleanser to give this a try becuase it is not as harsh as the salicylic acid. I am sorry I cannot use this anymore it really did wash my face very well.
8560,"Great quality & shape of brush!_An overall wonderful product. I love the Ecotools brushes, and hadn't seen this shape/style of brush in the local stores. So, after watching it on Amazon for a while, I decided to splurge.  It's a better quality than some of the other brands' fan brushes I've had...no shedding, soft, even texture, & picks up powder evenly.  I love this brush, and am glad I got it.  I haven't had it all that long yet, so I have not had to clean it & can't give any feedback on if it sheds during or after washing.  But, so far, there's been no shedding, and the brush's head (ferrule) is a very secure one on the base (no wobbling or danger of falling off).  Worth the money."
1620,No more pencil needed!_Very pleased with this product.  Recommend using a spoolie or eyebrow brush to apply.  Will color your skin a bit - just use some shampoo or dishsoap to remove it.  Follow timing instructions closely or you will get super dark brows.  My brows looks fuller & no longer need pencil to fill them in.
6633,"Pretty peepers, high up-front cost, good value overall_I'm turning 26 and a bit rough on my eyes (rubbing off mascara ever single day can really abuse the sensitive skin around my eyes). Since your eyes are where everyone gazes, keeping your peepers pretty is incredibly important. I notice the beginning of very fine lines on days I'm tired or the skin around them is dry. Since the skin around your eyes is some of the thinnest and most delicate on your body, wear on it will show FAST.I've been using this product nightly for 2 weeks now and I quite enjoy it. (The directions suggest using it during the day too, and I think it's lightweight enough to do so, but I'll leave that to others to try.) I can definitely see an improvement the next morning after I wear it to bed, though it's nothing magical (at least after 2 weeks). I rub a tiny amount under my eyes, on my lids, and up to my eyebrows. It is very lightweight and absorbs quickly with absolutely no eye irritation. I've tried other night-creams and the consistency and texture of this is perfect to me. I can't do heavy or oily products since it can make my skin greasy or break out. This is neither.I do think the product is rather pricey, however I end up using such a tiny amount that I think one jar will last me a good 4-6 months. Breaking down the cost, it's a pretty decent price for a product I really enjoy."
5361,Amazing_for the price of the product it works great. It is just as good as higher priced brands and leaves your brushes so clean and soft. Would recommend it to anyone!!
1954,"Wanted to love it but turned my skin red._This product did not work as well for me as it apparently has for so many. I was very hopeful for this product. I have oily - combination skin that is acne prone. I am 29 and still struggle with skin problems. I have tried most of the popular acne kits/products. I chose to go ahead and also buy the Bragg's vinegar that everyone recommends. I mixed the vinegar with the clay and used it as a mask. I left it on for just over 10 mins until it mostly dried. When I washed it off I was shocked to find that my skin was extremely tight and had turned a bright red color near all the edges where I put the mask. I don't know if I was somehow allergic to a component or if my sometimes sensitive skin overreacted,  or if perhaps it dried my skin out too much. I would be shocked of it were an allergy. I would also be shocked if it dried my skin out since I have truly greasy skin. I'm not sure what went wrong, but my skin did not look or feel better after using the mask. I am willing to give it a try one more time and will update my review if I see different results. I gave 2 stars because I do at least appreciate the simplicity of the product. Hopefully I have better luck next time."
3599,"good makeup remover_I got this product because it's the only one I found that isn't oil-based and won't leave a film on my eyes if I use it when i'm wearing my contacts. It does leave a slightly oily feeling on your skin, though."
978,OMG I am in love_I got this soap to try and I have to say I am in love.  I have very sensitive skin and  used this on my face everyday.  Helped take the makeup off and get my face clean.  It did not break me out at all and i can see the difference in just a few days.  It also smells wonderful.
5736,Inexpensive_And portable since is opens to be flat. Reasonable product for a reasonable price. Not my go to brush but one I can throw in my bag and not worry about.
8280,"fun and nice_fantastic brushes and dotting tools. makes life easier when doing acrylic nails. the dotting pens are fun, different sizes makes great increasing and decreasing dot designs"
3688,Awesome Eyeliner/Shadow Pencil !!! A++++_This is an awesome Silver Chrome Finish. Does not smudge. I love it that it has a high silver shine! Great for evening wear!
388,"love this soap_for its fresh, zesty, orangy smell.generally, i prefer soaps to shower creams and lotions, cause soaps make me feel squeeky clean. but they also dry my skin out like crazy, so i try not to use them often.but when i do, then it's one of my three favorites among lush soaps.the fact that they are all natural and not tested on animals is added value in my world :)"
8122,"Covers Grays_I bought this dye, Vidal Sassoon dye in medium chocolate brown, to cover my grays.  My hair is already a very dark brown and I had whitish shiny streaks of gray in it here and there so I wanted to cover it up.  It's a medium brown so it's not as dark as I'd like it to be but it did cover the grays, turned the grays a light brown instead of white like I had before, rest of my hair is dark but I can see some light brown at the crown of my head.  Once you mix the dye in the bottle it turns orange-it's supposed to look like this so don't let it freak you out, your hair won't turn orange, when it dries it turns the correct brown color.  It wasn't very stinky but it did smell like chemicals but nothing horrible, however it was potent enough to make my eyes burn and tear a bit and I had the window open in my bathroom all the way.  Left it on for 30 min.  Rinsed.  Even though I rinsed it pretty good when I squeezed the water out of my hair the water still came out brown, even after rinsing seemed to run clear water.  So I went and rinsed it out in the shower and used a small amount of shampoo and then the conditioner it comes with.  The conditioner they provide is a long red tube which has enough conditioner in it to last a couple more shampoos, they give you alot.  I didn't see anything impressive about the outcome from the conditioner but the color does adhere to the grays making them a shade lighter than the rest of my hair.  The color also may be a shade lighter because I did a quick shampoo afterwards but it didn't wash the color out of my hair or strip the color, I used a tiny amount of shampoo, less than I usually use.  It does feel soft  however.  Afterwards I let my hair air dry (no hair dryer), then used Got 2 be flat iron balm/spray on my hair and then flat ironed my hair straight-no color came off on the flat iron at all. Before flat ironing my hair it did look a bit frizzy but it was very humid here today so not sure if that was from the dye or conditioner or the weather, the flat iron took care of the frizzies and in combination with the flat iron  balm made it smooth and shiny.  Personally I feel the color adhered quite well, last time I used a foam dye and it was patchy, I'm finding this creme dye covered much more evenly.  Can't see my grays anymore, grays are now a light brown and the rest of my hair is dark but this is only really noticable in direct sunlight, inside the house it looks all brown.  I like it but next time I'd go just a shade darker, just my personal preference but as for color coverage it works quite well. So......PROS:Even color coverageCovers gray hair strandsEasy to use, not very messyDye is extremely easy to wash off of skin with just water, comes right off even after drying on skinTakes only 30 quick minutesDoes not smell very much while waiting 30 minutesProvides lots of conditioner, enough to last numerous showers and shampoos (and the conditioner smells really good)I used regular shampoo on it within 20 min afterwards (was not a color treated safe shampoo) and the color held and didn't wash out at all.  I used Suave Keratin shampoo.Dye did not come off on my flat iron within hours of dying it.  Even at almost 400 degrees.CONS:Slight odor when applying color, can make your eyes burn without direct contact, even when there's ventilation.  Be sure to use this product quickly and you can avoid this.  My eyes only started burning when I was almost done.Dye turns orange in bottle, may put some people off and confuse some into thinking they got the wrong color or their hair may turn orange! (this is normal, it's supposed to look orange)Color on  box may vary with your results, though almost all hair dye is like this.TIPS:If you want to flat iron your hair after using this be sure to use a flat iron spray or balm, it not only protects your hair from heat but also seems to protect the color as well.  If your hair is frizzy after a dye job, and you want straight hair, use a flat iron.  I have a Remington Shine flat iron infused with avocado, completely smoothes out dry or frizzy hair and makes it shiny.To shine up your color treated hair purchase anything called 'shine spray', self explanatory, use this after flat ironing.If you want to dry your hair with a hair dryer make sure to put flat iron balm or spray on it first, same concept as a flat iron, protects your hair from the heat.  AFter blow drying it spray either some water or a cool conditioner spray on your hair-you have to cool down your hair after being under such heat, keeps it from getting frizzy or looking dry.All in all I'd buy this dye again but in a darker color, much better than a foam dye and sticks to the hair pretty good."
8213,"Great idea!_I got to try this free thanks to Influenster! I love the idea of a lotion that is easy to use, and this lotion lives up to that promise! It's not quite as moisturizing as I'd like, but I will continue to use in addition to my regular brand, on days when I'm in a crunch for time."
8467,"3 in 1_I'm always suspicious of products that claim to have multiple primary functions. If it's a good shampoo it can't be a good bodywash, and I would never try to shampoo or condition my hair with bodywash. This is a strange mix of the two. My husband uses Axe products, both the body wash and the shampoo/conditioner. I won't be updating my shopping list; he still prefers the separate products to the combo. This product has a consistency that is closer to bodywash than shampoo. I'm not sure what the draw is for meshing the two together. Maybe good for travel?"
3010,Didn't expect much but was a great buy!_I got this product just to have a powder to lightly set my makeup and I got to say it works better than I thought it would even considering I dnt use much of the product whenever I apply it. It's so light but helps get rid of the shine on my face but still leaves a bit of sheen so you know ur skin can breathe with this on and it looks natural and effortless. The other day I was too tired to fuss with makeup so I jus applied concealer under my eyes and buffed this product onto myface and it gave a really nice finish. Evened out my skin tone and even in the evening it still felt comfortable on it's own. Love this foundation!
6063,"Very good nail gel_I love the way this product looks on my nails, although it is VERY difficult to really tell what a color looks like from a computer.  This is very neon bright!  I think the next one won't be neon.  :)  I trust that if you want neon, this is a very pretty color!"
3225,"Worked Great for Me!_I will give the product 4 stars for now because I used it only once with fabulous results! While out of town, my hair became wet while my family and I were out sightseeing (the weather was damp and rainy). I purchased this product at Walmart because the brand my daughter uses was not in supply (although I never tried hers previously). Later that night in our hotel room, I washed, conditioned and blow dried my hair. My daughter flat-ironed it using this spray. I was surprised at the result: shiny, soft - simply beautiful hair! I recommendeded the product later that year to my friends to try out. I am African American with a relaxer. I've tried other heat protectants before and have not experienced such results. I'm not the best at using heat styling tools, so maybe my daughter's deft hand helped a bit. Any way, I still have a good amount of the product left and will use it up until finished. I am trying to stay away from heat styling so it may take a while."
3013,I use it to tame my brows._It works perfectly and I would recommend it.  It gives your makeup a more finished look.  I like that it is colorless.
9526,"VERY soft but frizzy_I'm always on the lookout for products to help my hair.  I'm not as kind to my hair as I used to be - the past few years it's been through several dyes, pool chlorine and heat/stress from a flat iron.  The damage was really showing.  I changed shampoos and conditioners, I tried a few leave-ins, I trimmed the ends, and it still felt abused.I've used the Suave Infusion for two weeks now.  After two days I noticed a big difference in the texture of my hair - it was back to being soft and silky.  After the first week the ends started feeling less brittle as well.  The scent is pretty strong, not necessarily unpleasant, but it lingers for hours.  My hair is fairly long, down to my waist, and two pumps from the bottle is plenty.  I expect the bottle to last a good long while.My only issue has been the wild frizz.  Maybe the Infusion is supposed to add more body, maybe it's just my hair, but every time I use the product, my hair almost doubles in size.  The poof gets almost out of control.  It's not necessarily a bad thing, but I've taken to putting it back in a pony tail to try to curtail some of the frizz and poofiness.  For the softness and the change in texture, especially at the ends, I think it's worth it, but that's the only downside I've come across."
7556,"Still using it!_I've been using this product for about a month and I do like it. I use it at night because it's REALLY thick and during the day I feel like it would make my face feel greasy. When I wake up though, it feels great. Very soft and healthy!"
7891,"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G_SO AMAZING , the cantainers aree worth 6 dollars itself but the beads are amazing an awesome, im very happy"
646,"Amazing product._I'm not sure where I got this or how I ended up with it but I've had it under my cabinet for probably quite sometime now. I was looking for hair spray the other day and it was right in front of me and so I decided to give it a try. Had I known how awesome this product was I never would have had this under my cabinet for so long it would have been gone that very same month... I don't know how long it would have taken to use but I would have used it all.LOVE this product. It's amazing. It really does keep my hair volumized. Honestly, I have super flat hair and although it does flatten out a little as the day goes on, nothing like my hair is used to.I cannot get enough of this product and will be buying it up!"
6910,Comfortable_Great price.Easy to apply and very comfortable to wear.I would recommend them to anyone interested in wearing these!
2984,"Lovely, but too expensive._I bought this product to clear out my skin. It works well, reducing break outs, but it is way to expensive. I have switched to Nubian's lotions and soaps. They are SUPER cheap and work just as well."
7669,"Very real looking_Everyone thinks this wig is my real hair. I just wish I would have read the description a little better. You can see your hair line because there is a big hole towards the front of the piece where you can pull out and mix in your own hair. This would have been nice, if I had hair to pull through. I sewed it up, and It looks a little warped, but nobody seems to notice. The fit is really snug, but it is really comfortable. I suggest cutting the drawstring out. The drawstring pull in and tangles the hair.This wig is a steal. It feels so real!!"
365,its nothing special._Its the same thing as getting a cleanser in a drugstore. Only cheaper. This bottle is expensive and just like any other cleanser.
5927,Great replacement for Josie maran argan oil_I want to start off by saying that I used the Josie maran argan oil for about two months and I didn't want to spend so much money on the full size so I researched and found that this was a good replacement. I have been using this for a month now and I can totally see a difference. My nails have been breaking like crazy and I was getting so frustrated so I took a couple drops and massaged it into my cuticles and nail bed. Then I left it overnight and the next morning I could tell my nails looked better though they hadn't mysteriously become perfect. So I repeated it for the next couple of days and by the end of the week I noticed that my nails were much shinier. They started to grow pretty evenly and the breakage stopped. The surrounding areas on my nails were also less dry and I didn't have to even trim my cuticles.I also used this on my hair because it is chemically treated. About once a week I do a deep treatment where I just massage the oil into the ends of my hair and put the rest on my scalp. I leave it on overnight and wash my hair in the morning. It has made my hair much much softer and shinier. I can wear my hair naturally a lot more now than before. I also put a couple drops in my hair serums or anti frizz creams and it doesn't weigh my hair down. This oil is working great so far and the price is reasonable. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for argan oil.
2893,Works_This solved the problem of rough sandal straps across my toes.  Foot Petals cost a little more but they are worth the price.  They stay in place and don't slide around like the cheaper brands.
8169,"love the color and very versatile_I love this color. It seems to be a bright orange color when looking at it inside, but when I go outside it is a very vibrant mango color with a little  more pink. I love the IBD and it wears as well as the gelish if not better. I have combined this with a few other colors to create different looks such as  a hot pink glitter coat over the mango to get the coral look or a dark orange glitter to get the fall look. It is a great color and looks great for summer and fall. I love it and have worn it for a few months just redoing it every few weeks with a little variation."
7703,Love love love_These work on a number of different type of foundations. I've even used it with A concealer pallet. It's the perfect size for me I have relatively small hands and it works so amazing when you use it to apply your foundation. It gets in every little nook and crevice and believe me you have those. It works best damp with a little water or even your favorite setting spray before you add any product to it.
389,"The scent is so nice... it's intoxicating!_My favorite of all LUSH's Bath Bombs!  Smells so good, and leaves my skin really soft and moisturized.  What I love best about LUSH's bath bombs (and the bubble bars) is the fact that you don't need to rinse off after using them.  You just relax in your tub, and when you're done you just towel off.The  Sex Bomb contains jasmine, which I am not really a fan of, however I found this bath bomb to smell SOOOO good.  It must be the other essentials oils as well.  The scent lingers and I can still smell it the next day.  Sex Bomb made my bath water (I don't have a tub, but I used my boyfriends tub) a really nice pink color, and the rice paper rose slowly dissolved.  It made the water so silky and soft as well.  As weird as that sounds, you know what I'm talking about if you've tried a LUSH bath bomb before.  For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, go out and get one NOW!  You won't be disappointed!Good things DO come in small packages!"
1124,"What a beautiful color!_I was so pleasantly surprised how beautiful this color is - the picture color doesn't do it justice.  It makes my face light up! I am especially glad it's not dark - I like lighter shades that make you skin look creamier (I have brown hair and light skin). Also, has nice moisture and spreads so nicely. I highly recommend. Shipped on time and packaged well for shipping."
91,"FOR DRY OR MATURE SKIN_Sometime a little more help is needed than a lotion offers - that's where this Creme comes in.  It's especially beneficial for those with dry skin or delightful ladies of &quot;a certain age.&quot;Jason was one of the first natural personal care companies to manufacture Ester-C products, and they've been doing it ever since.  The Ester-C line offers a natural type of Vitamin C that helps skin form and maintain collagen thus serving to discourage fine lines and wrinkles."
6516,"Great Colors!!_I have Indian skin, medium tan, and I wanted to get a warm/neutral eyeshadow pallete and I found this one. After reading the reviews, I had to try it. And I love it!! I can mix and match for casual day at work and at night I can add to what I have for a nightime look. Great for summer when I have my bronzy look going. And for the price you really get a bang for your buck! I will be purchasing more."
2589,"LOVE this stuff!_I was introduced to DHC about 10 yrs ago when I moved in with my then boyfriend/now husband. His X used this stuff and her mail was still coming to our house, so I decided to give one of the free samples that came, a try. Of course after I promptly told our mail lady that his X no longer lived here! Anyways, I used this amazing deep cleansing oil. I was really skeptical at first. I mean, oil on your skin and it's supposed to cleanse as well? Hmmmm. Well, it worked! and it worked amazingly well! I love this stuff. It's like the fountain of youth in a bottle. Okay, it's not THAT good, but pretty darn close. I branched out and tried some of their other products and found that my tried and true favorites are the Deep Cleansing oil, the virgin olive oil moisturizer, the under eye cream and the daily night time moisturizer. I won't go anywhere without these gems and I use them religiously every night and every day. I have had compliments on my skin ever since using DHC. It's a wee bit pricey but I have used products that were double in price and didn't work at all. So, my motto is, if it works, use it!"
9030,Really great useful clips_I have been using these awesome clips because Salon Guys allowed me to join their market research program.  My daughter has very thick coarse hair and they hold her hair without falling out or hurting her.  I have much softer and fine hair and these clips are amazing for me as well.  They do not leave creases in my hair or let my hair slip out.  I like to use these for drying my hair in sections and straightening it.  These would work well for doing highlights as well.  The service from Salon Guys was great!  Fast arrival and nice people with good follow up.
1742,Not the color expected at all._This is not black with an auburn color to it. It is red. My roots are now a dark but very obvious red.
2850,helps_this definately helps your naso-labial lines to fade. Make sure you use it continually.  Maybe even try a few facial exercises to help strenghten facial muscles and bring fresh blood full of nutrients to your face.
9699,"Great Shampoo for the Natural Curls_I no longer relax my hair and have tried numerous products to enhance my natural curl. Though most of them have worked, they have left my hair dry and dull. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this shampoo along with the conditioner brings out my natural curls beautifully. I use all three products from Clear Scalp and I can honestly say my hair is so healthy and smooth with just the right amount of shine and the smell is amazing keeps my hair hydrated all season long."
5039,"Olay_I have used it - I like it.. It's very much like the buffer I was using from Susan Lucci.  I also think you could use it with other cleansers. I also like that you can use this one in the shower - that's a nice feature.  Also, I think anything that massages your face will probably have to help flex your skin and give it more elasticity which will in turn help to moisturize and lighten your wrinkles. However, I think the cleansing solution is a bit high at around $20 per tube (6oz) and I think the replacement brushes are not that cheap either - they go for roughly $5 a brush. Over all I recommend it.  Marilyn Riggs"
3153,"Love love love the scent! Wish it were a bath fizz though_The scent is absolutely amazing. It's a blend of Juniper (balances and restores), Orange (renews and rejuvenates), and menthol (comforts and relaxes). When I take the lid off, I immediately smell the scent of menthol, which clears my sinuses immediately. But I like it because it's got a nice freshness from the juniper and the citrus.I also like that this is a pretty natural product. Village Naturals states that this product is 99.51% naturally derived. It contains Sea Salt, Epsom Salt, Corn Starch, Vitamins A, B2, C, and E, as well as a variety of natural extracts in addition to the ones mentioned above.The instructions call to use roughly 1/3 cup under running water. I just eyeball it and shake in what looks to be the right amount. Based on how much I used, I could probably get about 6-7 uses from this 20-ounce bottle. The crystals immediately disintegrate and the fresh invigorating scent fills my bathroom. No foam or bubbles are produced, but I did check their website and they have a foaming bath oil product in the same scent. The crystals also do not change the color of the water.Although I normally prefer foaming bath products, I immediately fell in love with Stress and Tension Mineral Bath Soak. It leaves the water nice and soft, and my skin feels so much better afterwards. I would definitely say that it's less drying than a foaming product. The scent does last quite a while, too, although that's not as much a priority for me.  I use this on nights that I just want a quick 10-minute bath (save the bubble products for long soaks) to warm me up before bed and relax me. It definitely is a soothing scent that helps relieves stress. It reminds me a lot of scents used in spas, so it does feel high end and luxurious.Overall, a very good bath product. It's a little bit boring in that it doesn't change the color of the water, fizz, or product bubbles, but the scent makes up for these deficiencies. 4 stars."
2817,Beware! No flaws left behind!_Just received this mirror and it is great! Wonderfully bright lighting and high magnification leaves no flaw unnoticed. I was amazed by what I hadn't seen before. Great for finding those pesky chin hairs that go unnoticed in dim light (thank goodness). In any event this is a very good product. Wish it came in a nickel bronze color as it would match my bathroom settings though. It even has a twisty neck so that the mirror can be tilted at different angles for convenience.
7829,"Best foundation (BB cream)/sunscreen I have ever used!_This helps cover the slight melasma I have and I get compliments on my skin all of the time, even from my doctor!! I am 40 and this helps turn back that clock :)  I have also noticed a change in my skin, I use IMAGE skin care as well so i believe I have found the perfect combination of skin care and make up, finally! Stays on pretty well too! A little goes a long way!"
1592,"Great price_I use this gel for my clients. It's a great price and crystal clear. Sometimes there are little bubbles, but that comes with every gel of every price. I prefer this builder gel over the clear gel. Clear gel isn't as clear."
3249,"Creamy blush_Sorry this is being discontinued as it's a nice creamy blush, rather than a powder, which I don't care for at all."
3190,"Awesome_Its funny coz I only got this so it'll become $25 to get free shipping... (tho now I have student prime membership) and this turned it to be a great product!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!! It keeps ur hair nice and sleek, shiny and smooth and SMELLS GREAT too lol. I usually use l'oreal and now I ran out of this and I really miss it!!! >.&lt; I might purchase it again! &lt;- I'm cheap so I might just wait till l'oreal one is gone lol"
2599,"Excellent Fragance_the nautica blue for men is an excellent fragance at an excellent price, here in Colombia where i Live this costs much more!"
9791,"OMG THIS IS IT! Don't hesitate!_I have been using this product for a good month straight once a week, and let me tell you it does exactly as it says it should. After just the first use I could feel that my skin was firmer and that my pores seemed to be smaller. Which is a huge feat in it of itself with my pores! After the complete month of use my pores have stayed much smaller than they have been in years and my skin has a much firmer look and feel to it. I would say stop thinking about it and do it! I will definitely repurchase. Well worth the $$ as you will most likely get 6 months to a year out of one tube depending if you use once or twice a week!"
3237,"BLUSH RUSH_So for this pretty peach shade, it is right on point. The only thing you have to be careful of is how much you apply because if you don't watch out, you'll look like a 7 year old who just tried on mommy's make up for the first time."
1519,"A touch of color -- almost impossible to put on too much_This is technically a highlighter, not a blush; but I use it as a blush most of the time. My skin is very light (terms like 'ivory' and 'porcelain' appear in the names of all my foundations) and this adds a nice bit of color without seeming too red or like too much. I actually like to use a kabuki brush to apply it."
8994,Nice texture and smell_This is a nice mud mask in the aspect of the feel and smell.  although I didn't have a good experience with it.  For some reason my skin reacted to it in a negative way.  when applied and removed my face had the look and feel of being sunburn.  But a friend of mine used it also and had wonderful results
7722,Pretty good but thin._This is a basic BB cream and I think it does the job okay. It has light/medium coverage and looks nice on. It has no real scent. Of all the Drugstore BB creams this one has the most shades. This works good for virtually any shade of skin or skin type. I like that it has SPF too because otherwise I would never have on SPF lol. I have used a lot of Foundation and BB creams but this is the best of the drugstore bb creams by far.
8407,"great_This is a good product it does all 3 it also smells good.  I still use conditioner on my daughters hair because our hair is really hard to brush without it no matter what kind of 2 in 1 we use but, it's great on my sons shorter hair great product!"
6389,perfect_Really Recommend this brush .. the bristles are very softeveryone should have a pencil brush to get a perfect eye look
2493,auwful service_i love the products of opi. this nail envy changed my life its amazing and i reccomend it to everyone. i have bitten my nails for years now ot this made my nails amaznly strong and long. i had purchased the original formula but i used it all up so my nails  bevame the same again brittle and soft. i bought that and i waited to came but it never did. i lost my money and i really wanted this. now i cant get it because i moved in greece and the shipping is super expensive. i give the one star due to my money lost
4165,Dead Sea Salt excellent for my skin type_Dead Seas Mud Soap works perfect for my face.  And this product is reasonably priced and it works well for my skin.  Dead sea salt has medicinal wonders and I feel it while using this soap.
2030,"Orange_This has the exact same scent and consistency as a QVC brand. Had the same results too, not good ones. I have been using self tanners for years. Now and then I will try one a friend might mention they like. I should stick with the one that works for me. Like the QVC version, this one had streaks, some orange to it, and mostly washed off in the shower. I use Hempz self tanner, and matches my natural tan perfectly. No orange, no Streaks no wash off."
5562,"LOVE THE SMELL_I purposefully chose eucalyptus, and I haven't been disappointed.  I love inhaling this strong minty smell.  It opens up the cavities - thank you."
9882,It's not as scary as it sounds!_I was honestly pretty nervous about using this and was picturing my face being all bloody. You NEED to follow the instructions and maybe even watch a couple of youtube videos of people using this at home but it does work and it's not going to make you bleed or die of pain. Give it a shot or smooth skin!
8123,"More of a Greasy, Oily Tinted Moisturizer_I was really hoping this Olay BB Cream would be a great product since it is much cheaper than my current BB cream. Unfortunately, it does not live up to my expectations. I knew that it wouldn't be as good when I saw that you are supposed to apply it every 2 hours and 15 minutes before sun exposure. Most BB Creams are designed to last all day.I have oily skin and as a result I am not a huge fan of a lot of tinted moisturizers. I know that the description of this product says BB Cream AND Tinted Moisturizer (which a product should be one or the other, not both), but I wanted to try it anyhow. I was hoping that it was not greasy. The second I put it on my skin, I felt oily and gross. I continued to apply it just to see if it made my skin look any better. It didn't. It made it look as oily as it felt and it didn't really do much for my uneven skin. I had to wash it off 15 minutes later and my face still felt gross.The supposed benefits of Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream and my results:*Refreshes- It did not refresh for me since it made me feel dirty and oily*Brightens- If by 'Brightens' they mean shiny, then it did do this*Evens Tone- definitely not. My skin was still uneven looking*Hydrates- It did hydrate my skin into an oil slick*Smoothes- It made all of my skin oily, I guess technically it did smooth it*Protects- With only SPF 15 and directions to apply every 2 hours, I could not trust this alone to protect my pale skin.This product may work for some people with dry skin. It just did not work for me. If you want a BB cream that will truly do all of these things, has a higher spf and you only have to apply ONCE a day; trySmashbox Camera Ready BB Cream SPF 35 Light/Medium(warning: Smashbox BB Cream is expensive, but it works great for oily skin)."
3575,"Miracle shine is perfect!_Great product for straight hair! Tames fly away hair and leaves no heavy oily feeling on your hair. Shipped from store, as described and received very timely. Thanks, I love this product!"
1655,good thing_I love it. no sticky or greasy effect. it smells good and seems like it does its job. Definitely can recommend it
486,awesome!!_Awesome product.  I have to use it every other day because my skin is sensative.  It still leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.
5782,Night Renewal Cream_Love the feel of the night cream.  Would liked to have smelled the cocao butter but that's just me. After a few weeks of using the cream my skin seemingly feels softer. Not oily and I would recommend this cream for normal or normal/oily skin types.
5339,"Good product_Glides on easily, although the accompanying brush is not particularly good.  I like the color and so far, it seems to last."
1094,"Perfect mild soap for normal/combination skin._I sometimes will go without wearing makeup, when I do that I will turn to my Clinique mild soap because it is great for keeping my skin clean without over drying.If you wear a full face of makeup (concealer, foundation, powder) you might want to go for a stronger soap.My husband borrows this face wash from time to time, it gives him a noticeable clean glow.This is a neutral smelling cleanser, perfect for me since I do not care for the perfumed soaps."
6372,"Best quality tanning mitt_This one lasts me months longer than other tanning mitts. No rips or excessive staining. And the material is thicker, not flimsy."
6783,"A little goes a long way_I was pleasantly surprised by the product, makes my hair very soft. Be warned... a little goes a long way, you do not need a lot to cover your entire head. The shipping cost was too high, I will purchase product again, but will order from a different source."
7987,Super Fun Set!_Nail Art is the all the rave right now and with this set you will be looking like a pro in no time. The colors are magnificent and the brushes are great quality which means the results will be perfect everytime!
4557,"Nice product_This is a nice product. I've known about the benefits of castor oil for years. My mother used to use castor oil on my hair as a child. I wanted it so I could work on my fine baby hairs and thicken the hair on the front area of my scalp. My hair grows quickly but has a tendency to break a lot at the front. Since purchasing this, the product has thickened my hair in the areas I've used it. I noticed positive results within days. I also use organic cold pressed castor oil from time to time. I massage a small amount of either into my scalp in the selected areas nightly when I prepare my hair before bed. I also use some in my weekly deep conditioning treatment."
1878,"Great for daily exfoliation_I bought this in order to exfoliate everyday.  I have combination skin and I use this for daily exfoliation with a mild soap.  This bristles are soft enough for everyday use but firm enough to leave your face clean.  The brush is small, yes, (about the diameter of a silver dollar) but it's for your face so it's a good size.  My only issue with it is I have no where to leave it in the shower; it's too small to hang and sometimes fall off the shower rack.  I would recommend this brush for everyday use.I have a firmer boar's hair brush for once per week exfoliation."
6173,great dupe_I've never tried the beauty blender sponge so I can't compare them but this sponge works really well to blend foundation pretty much flawlessly. I will definitely be ordering a few more.
4027,"good to use once a week to have healthy hair_I always use a hair mask/leave in conditioning treatment once a week.  I like to try everything once, so I got to this after using the moroccan oil one which was alright.  I like this one better.  The smell isn't too strong or fakey.  I use it in the shower and leave it in for 10 or more minutes, then rinse out.  I use their detangler along with it and I like them both!  I have waist length hair that is fine/thin but I have lots of hairs on my head.  I live in CO so I need lots of extra care for my hair.  I would recommend this - everyone should try it to see if it works for them.  If your hair isn't too dry, I wouldn't put it on the scalp, just from like the ears down and more on the ends."
6284,Love this stuff!_My menopausal skin has been giving me issues..scaling..oily..like a teenagers skin but I had never had trouble with my skin. This really makes your skin shine through. Bought 4 more!
8982,"Just what I was looking for_CG Flamed Out Mascara is just the right formula for my lashes.  It goes on smoothly, with no clumping or pulling of lashes.  One or two strokes with the brush is all I required for thicker and longer looking lashes.  I think I have finally found just what I was looking for in a mascara."
2278,My fave conditioner._This product really work well. It leave my hair silky and shine. Plus it just smells so amazing. I get mine at CVS for a fraction of the cost.
951,"best 5 bucks I ever spent_I hate those big pouf balls that just eat up shower gel and do nothing but move it around on my skin.  I have no idea what makes this humble looking thing work so well, but the first time I used it and saw how effectively it exfoliates, I was seriously standing there in the shower with my jaw hanging open.  My skin felt fantastic, glowing and squeaky clean, and now I cannot shower without this little gem."
4556,"Fullness_This will be a staple product for me, it aids in hair regrowth and fullness of hair, the process may be slow but once you are consistent with a good hair regime you will get results."
1506,"I love this product._I love this product.  Many moisturizers irritate my skin, including products like Clinique.  This is the one moisturizer that doesn't!  It is NOT greasy or smelly.  My face feels soft after I use it and I only need to use a little bit."
7745,"Great nail color_This is a very pretty orange-red polish and goes on very smoothly and evenly. Like all gelish polishes, be sure to shake for at least 30 seconds so product mixes well. The bottle was there full size so fantastic price."
99,good_I don't normally wear mascara but I bought this for the few times I do. The product seems to be good and natural. I like this product.
1779,Great!_I was also skeptical about this product. But actually it works so well. My eyelashes and eyebrows grow. And it darkens my eye.Awesome!
1214,"Not a 'tint', but an AWESOME Mascara!_I ordered this  'Peter Lamas Natural Lash Builder, Tint, Conditioner' after reading the reviews & knowing full well it probably was NOT a true 'lash tint' & rather more likely a mascara-like tinting conditioner. I was right. I tried it out as soon as it arrived & wore it over night. It did NOT last the night! But! I gave it 4 stars because; I can't wear mascara! I've tried every single type out there, gave it up! I use those 'Lash Builders' & then use 'clear mascara'. Colored mascara clumps on me, plain & simple. I always, every single time-end up taking it off. This stuff-not a clump to be found anywhere! AMAZING! While it is nowhere near a long-lasting 'tint', it is definitely a wonderful, non-clumping mascara! YAH! As far as the 'builder' & 'conditioner' part, that remains to be seen, but it has now become my one & only favorite mascara of all time! TYVM, Peter Lamas! :)"
7754,"Cute._The product is really quite nice. I bought 3 and I've had them for a while. I bought 3 of the straight kind. Keep in mind, the straight kind is VERY. straight. I  can only make it blend in if I've straightened my hair to a pin. I also bought a few curly ones since my hair is naturally  curly. Overall, good value."
9789,"Gentle yet effective on my skin._The consistency of the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Mask is thicker compared to the mask I am currently using. It does look like &#34;green baby poop&#34; :) but believe me, the benefits of using the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Mask makes up for the somewhat &#34;gross&#34; color. :) And to think about it, all the mud masks I use have the same color. :) It felt weird because in all the mud masks I've tried, I get that &#34;tightening feeling&#34; when the mud mask starts to dry up. I didn't get that &#34;tightening feeling&#34; when the Adovia Mud Mask started drying up or even when it dried up completely. I was a bit skeptical if it really worked or not. So when it dried up after about 15 minutes, I rinsed my face with warm water and patted it dry. :) I am definitely in love with the Adovia Mud Mask. This is the first time I didn't get the &#34;tightening feeling&#34; I feel on other mud masks but the result is just as great as the other 3 mud masks I'm using. One thing I noticed was that my face didn't get dry afterwards. I didn't even use a moisturizer after using the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Mask. It worked very well to soothe and calm my red pimples (although it's not that visible on my &#34;before&#34; picture, I assure you I am acne prone and have small pimples all throughout the year and have 2 to 3 &#34;BIG&#34; pimples on that time of the month every month). I cannot say though if it's effective for Eczema and Psoriasis because thankfully, no one in my family has those skin problems."
391,"Love it!_I do not have any hair volume, this gave me a healthy amount of volume, I love it! So much easier to use instead of using a hair dryer and a round brush. Usually my arm gets tired once I get to the crown and kind of give up. This dryer/styler is very light weight and really easy to use. My hair looks so good when I use this to dry and style."
6572,"This is the best deal ever_These are awesome. They are small enoyugh that you can put them on your body/face with eyelash glue without it looking weird (Halloween), and they also look great on nails. Such a steal!"
3033,nothing special_i was looking for a good skin serum....but this one wasn't the one.  it really didn't do much for my skin.  previously i tried aveeno triple boosting serum...but they no longer have it in stores...online it's pricey....
5251,"Used for a long time now_I love Loreal products, the Waterproof mascara is true to its' word. It's a must have in the summer, I can sweat in my work-outs and not look like a raccon in the aftermath."
7746,"Too heavy!  Too Greasy!  Very little results..._I found this moisturizer to be too heavy and greasy feeling.  I did notice improved skin tone and moister skin immediately after application, but even after using a month, I see no permanent results especially no reductions in my lines. This is a product that claims to work after a week!  It also has a very overpowering smell that lingers.  The red glass jar is the nicest thing about this moisturizer, but I will be discarding it for a lighter product."
689,"Smells fresh, little powder, but still slightly masculine_I was very satisfied with this purchase. The smell is great. Fresh, clean, touch of powder, yet still notably masculine overall. The bottle looks great as well, and the spray applicator works flawlessly. I would have given this 5 stars instead of 4 were it not for the fact that, for me, the scent leaves after about three hours. I guess that is not too bad, and I would definitely make this purchase again just for the awesome scent."
5670,Love it_I love Tht the dotting tools are different sizes and they work great and love Tht they have a nice handle too
1165,great for getting curl back without washing_Love it. Puts the curl back after curls get flattened by sleeping. So it works great when I am rushed and need to get my hair looking better.
586,"Heaven For My Hair_Leaves hair silky, smooth, soft, and manageable. This effect does not fade either. I have used it daily for 4 days now, and I see and feel a total difference in my hair. I am happy I splurged and bought this one. I was not expecting it to help my hair this much, this quickly.This is seriously the solution to all hair issues. Bad hair days are not a thing of the past.The scent is also heavenly, and you can use it not just in your hair, but on skin as well. It feels fantastic no matter where you apply it."
7524,Awesome color!_This gelish color was everything I was hoping for!  It goes on easily over most any color and brings a beautiful shimmer to the under-color!  Very highly recommend it!
4290,"Can't do without it_For making buns and ponytails, this stuff smooths and silkens your hair so it lays right.  If you use to curl your hair with a curling iron, your curls will be soft and bouncy.  If you have natural hair and use it to do 2 or 3 strand twists, it's awesome.  It smells like suntan oil, which I love.  Get some."
4863,"I LOVE Gelish!_I love this nail polish, although it's more of a clear pink than pictured. It looks great on and once i received my other bottle of gelish (go girl, which is a solid pink) i'm going to use this on top or at the tip to make it look pretty :). I highly rec.!"
2007,"I am happy with these._I am happy with these. I have used all sorts of eyebrow shaping pencils; both expensive and inexpensive. These have medium consistency; not too creamy, not too stiff. The pigment also seems to last well. I still have to use a light hand, as will any eyebrow pencil, but these are great. The color matches my light brown hair well. I use them to fill in my sparse areas from over plucking in younger years."
346,"Gloss without the weight_My problem with normal lip gloss is the heavy feeling of goo on my lips. It feels less like something to make me attractive and more like something to draw flies to their death, getting hopelessly stuck in the goo.This gloss is different. It is light but shiny, it is sparkly but not glittery. I am a matte lipstick person, so this was a new look for me. I like the transparent colors and same Burts Bees protection that I have come to love."
3187,"Wonderful Leave In Conditioner_I have fine curly, colored treated hair.  This is the only stuff that keep the frizzies at bay!  I'm addicted and have started buying via subscription.  I would recommend =)"
8197,i hope they are good_I bought these a xmas gifts for the girls at a great price. I hope they actually work well as we can all use a quick facial once in a while.
3950,"Clog Your Pores, Stay Dirty, Feel Stale_This is the worst body wash I have ever used and I have used a few (from most regular mass market products like Axe, Old Spice to designer brands like Armani, Dunhill). The things that I expect from a bodywash/shower gel are:1) It should clean you very well and leave you feeling fresh (BUT while doing so it should not dry your skin). In the long run it should be good for the skin.2) It should not have any ingredient which is harmful for the skin. Specifically I avoid the following like plague: Petrolatum, Parben, Mineral Oil (apart from these, I also try to avoid SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate/ Sodium Laureth Sulfate) but it is hard to find a body wash or shower gel without SLS - its pervasive).3) Have a good soothing or invigorating fragrance (while not being so strong as to cause a headache)Before beginning this review let me tell you why I avoid the ingredients Petrolatum, Parben and Mineral Oil - all these ingredients, in the name of 'moisturizing your skin by locking in vital moisture' actually form a sheath on top of your skin and clog its pores. This is extremely unhealthy for the skin since skin, for being healthy, needs to be able to breathe freely for expelling impurities out of the system. The implication of using products (body washes, shower gels) with these ingredients is that you do not feel as fresh after the shower (compared to products  without these ingredients) since your skin pores are clogged and suffocated. Though I noticed that this Dove Men + Care Clean Comfort Body Wash contained Petrolatum (and SLS), I wanted to give it a try since I hold in high regard Unilever in general for their well engineered products and the Dove brand in particular for their moisturizing bar soap which is one of the best soaps for skin and is a fantastic product.However I was shocked when I used this. It is the worst of all worlds - This body wash almost does not clean you at all but leaves such a heavy residue on your skin that you will feel horrible - as if you did not have a shower at all. And dare you use this when you are a little more unclean than usual - when you come out of the shower you will wonder whether you had a shower at all. There is absolutely NO feeling of freshness OR cleanliness that you expect from a shower. Now some might argue that usually 'moisturizing' body washes are intended more to moisturize than to leave you feeling squeaky clean - well I'm not talking of anything even close to squeaky clean here - when you have a bath (even if it were with the world's most moisturizing soap/body wash) you expect to feel a minimal level of freshness (otherwise there is no point of a bath - you might as well smother yourself with moisturizing lotion instead).Ok - so this does a horrible job of cleaning. So what about its claims of moisturizing ? The only thing this body wash does is clog your pores and leave your skin feeling suffocated - not supple and well cared for. So if you have an oily skin or if you are a little stale from perspiration and get into the shower with this, you will feel horrible since this will 1) not clean you in any way 2) lock in the dirt that you had before the shower - can you imagine how bad that can feel ? I wonder whether this product was well tested on actual people (which is a basic requirement and the norm with any cosmetic manufacturer of credibility/repute) before being rolled out.As for the fragrance, its just OK. Nothing that you would look forward to.I'm thoroughly disappointed with Unilever for releasing such a badly engineered and tested product. This is extremely uncharacteristic of this very good FMCG company. I threw this in the bin after using it thrice (I was disgusted after the very first use but wanted to give this a chance just in case the first day was a 'bad bath day' - but alas the bad was not in the day - it was in the gel).Well this review was a passionate one and so could come across to some as bordering on the weird - for after all its a body wash isn't it ? Your life does not depend on it. But well, I am very particular about the decisions I make for my health, grooming and well being. This product was so horrible that it disgusted me to the extent necessary to elicit such strong feelings of dislike and disapproval. However, as I always suggest, do not take my word for it - try this yourself (if you want) with an open mind but at the same time being conscious of what to test/look for after reading this review - because after all you are the best judge of what suits you and what is good for you. Also, I strongly suggest that you try to find a cleaning product without SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate/ Sodium Laureth Sulfate), since SLS penetrates the skin and even the internal organs easily and can cause havoc like endocrinological imbalances, neurological disorders, organ toxicity and cancer on long term use."
3400,"Luxurious relief!_I've got pump bottles of moisturizer all around my house. In the kitchen, bathroom, near the recliner, on the shelf next to the couch... I am a frequent user of hand cream and body lotion and need to have it always within reach. Once the winter hits, that use becomes constant. I am a brand-switcher, and always try whatever is new or I've seen advertised promising relief from that itchy-tight feeling that drives me crazy.Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion, Vitamin Burst is great. The effect is long-lasting, the fragrance is fruity and I can deal with it. I wish it was a slightly lighter scent, but it is quite nice and does fade after a bit. I've even pumped some of it into a tiny plastic bottle to keep in my bag.I guarantee it will start replacing the other brands I've been using! Because it is so long lasting, it will save me money in the long run. I would definitely recommend this lotion to friends and family!"
5186,Fine_These work just as expected.  Long enough to hold wigs in place for styling.  Far price for the quantity you get.
1398,"Best on the market_Pureology products are a must for people who, for whatever reasons, don't need to be exposed to the toxins in ordinary shampoos and conditioners (Do any of us really?) It has a wonderful scent and gently cleans and conditions dyed hair. I have used it on and off for 8 years, and the only reason I don't use it ALL the time is the price. It is expensive, but you do save money by buying the larger sizes. Also, you don't have to use as much shampoo or conditioner on your hair as with some other hair products. An added bonus is the scent! Heavenly! Not to strong;very light and clean."
9645,"Shiny hair, scar reduction and best eye makeup remover EVER_Okay, I am going to be embarrassingly honest here. I had never heard of Argan oil before discovering it online. I had heard of its supposed magical powers and figured, 'Why not give it a try?'The bottle is just as a described: HUGE. You don't realize how much 4 ounces really is, but this bottle is going to last a long time and I love that it's multipurpose:I mix a few drops in my shampoo and wash my hair then condition. After rinsing I apply two to three drops on my scalp and brush through my hair. It absorbs. It is not greasy at all. Since the smell is barely there, it doesn't leave any type of odor. My hair is actually shinier AND I have a lot less fly-aways. Which is always a good thing.I had also read about its ability to reduce the appearance of scars. I thought it was just hype, but I've been using this for a few weeks now and a scar on my leg has been greatly faded. (I apply the Argan oil in the morning and at night). It was a fresh scar from a skin biopsy and I believe it will continue to fade with regular usage.Last, but not least, sometimes facial wash just does not get all of the eye make-up! Chemical-free and gentle eye make-up remover? Sign me up! I put some of this onto a Q-tip and go over anything my facial wash missed before continuing with the rest of my skincare regimen.The only possible issue is that because of the viscosity of the oil, it drips from the dropper. I believe that the cap has been changed so the product now dispenses from a pump instead of a dropper.I couldn't be more pleased with this product. Highest recommendation!"
2878,"LOVE IT! (Well, I did)_This mascara is the best I've ever used. I've never bought the same mascara twice, and will without a doubt, be buying this one many, many more times. This mascara makes my stubby lashes look super long, thick and the best part-- doesn't flake! Comes off easily with warm water, and after trying over 30 mascaras in maybe 5 years, I think I've finally found the one.(3/21) After using this product for a month, The mascara doesn't last, and flakes like CRAZY. Goes on well, and was amazing at first, but now is the equivalent of a cheapy brand."
5272,"Not greasy!!!_Actual Product -I've tried a few organic and less harmful sunscreens in the past and always ended up pitching them because they were a greasy mess.  I was very, very happy when I tried this to find that it's not greasy at all!  It rubs into the skin quickly and doesn't leave that filmy feeling.  I really didn't notice any smell from this product.Allergens -My daughter is allergic to many different sunscreens (Coppertone, Bullfrog, etc.)  and will break out in an itchy rash.  She has used this one a few times now and has had no reaction at all.Effectiveness -We've had quite a few days where we were in the sun all day and, so far, no burns at all with this.  My son is dark complected and tans through every sunscreen I've used, including this one, but I really can't ding the sunscreen for that since none have worked to stop that so far.Price -The price for this product seems to be in line with other sunscreens that aren't organic.  The bottle is decent sized and the product is thick enough to spread well.  Compared to other organic/more natural sunscreens, I feel like it's a pretty good price."
4491,Got it for the Nyx Eyebrow Push Up Bra_Got it to sharpen my Nyx Eyebrow Push Up Bra doublesided pencil (which I'm in love with) and it works great for that. Haven't tried it on anything else. Only reason 4 vs. 5 stars is sometimes the top pops off in my make up bag and spills the shavings everywhere which can be a pain.
6078,good product_I have fine hair that gets greasy easy and researched a lot before buying this product.  I love it.  It doesn't leave any build up on my hair and is just right for me.  Happy with my purchase.  I threw out all my other hairsprays.
9331,"Great shampoo but not magic!_I used both this and the conditioner from the same line for a week and here's a summary of my experiences:It lathers really wellIt smells FANTASTICLeft my hear shiny, soft and managableDidn't weigh my hair downDid it give my very fine hair amazing body? Nope! But did I really expect it to? Once again, no. If you are born with fine hair there isn't a magic potion you can take to change your genetics.So overall? It's a quality shampoo that smells great and leaves my hair in nice condition but not magic, and honestly I can find shampoo to do the same for a fraction of the price, so while I like it I, personally, wouldn't buy it."
119,Skin feels very clean and soft._My skin is oily in some spots and acne prone almost everywhere. This mask smoothes out my skin somehow and makes a bit clearer. I like it.
3005,"Concrete for your lashes!_This makes your lashes very hard (and dries them out and makes them prone to breakage too) and is almost impossible to get off, even with coconut oil. Somehow, it also manages to give me raccoon eyes after five or six hours too. Worst. Mascara. Ever."
4336,"Fairly dry concealer_Even though I had read previous reviews warning about how dry this product was, I decided to try it anyway and found that it is indeed very dry and the container is really small.  I ended up mixing it with a fluid concealer and it's worked out well but I won't purchase it again."
3716,"cool and refreshing, but leaves white foam on face_My wife uses these and tells me how great they are.  However, she didn't realize that her face was left with white foam in some areas until I told her.  The foam stays for a few minutes so make sure to do a mirror check after spraying.  Other than that, she loves this product.Strongly Recommended!"
6024,"Nioxin System_The item does make my hair look fuller however, it also dries it out.  I've tried using less...one pump per area, but that still doesn't seem to help the driness."
2968,"Nice and Inexpensive_I first tried this cream when I bought the kit at CVS drugstore.  I was not happy with the rest of the creams in the kit; but this one worked the best.I looked into Amazon to reorder because in the drugstore it was very expensive.  I am happy I was able to find it in Amazon for half the prize.  Whatever you buy, you must check it out at Amazon; they have the best prices."
4687,"Gets very hot, very fast. Durable_I've had this straightener for about 6 months and it's held up well to being dropped frequently (I'm clumsy...) and it heats up very fast. You can adjust the heat but not as much as I'd like. It ranges from 310-370 degrees and even at 310 it still will fry my hair if I don't put a TON of protector in. I have thin hair that gets damaged easily thought so I'm not sure this would be a problem for most people. It would definitely be 5 stars if I could just turn the heat down a little more. I'd still highly recommend it regardless, you can't find better for a comparable price."
1166,"Oh The Body Shop Aloe line, how I love thee._At the beginning of 2013, I decided that I was going to try and go natural and clean up the beauty products I was using. In December, I was using LUSH products, which I thought were natural (turns out, most of them aren't at all), and they worked for awhile but ended up making me break out after using them for a few weeks. During Christmas Break, I didn't want to see anyone or take any pictures because I was that ashamed of my face. I have NEVER broken out so bad and it seemed like no matter what I did, nothing worked. I desperately searched for natural products and after stumbling upon a website called GoodGuide.com, I found The Body Shop Aloe line. These products are highly rated on the site and contain no ingredients that are harmful to us. I use this cream both in the morning and at night because I tend to have oily skin and don't need the 'heavier' night cream the aloe line provides. I use my index finger, get a little of the lotion on it, dab it on my face in a few spots, then wet my fingertips with water and spread the lotion that way. Doing this allows you to use the lotion but also preserve it because you use the water to spread it. It also is great for me because I do tend to get oily and this lets me use the lotion without over-doing it. This lotion is light, refreshing, and doesn't leave me feeling greasy. I truly love it!After using this product for about a month, my face has almost completely cleared up. It has done a complete 180 and I am SO happy! Even the scars that I was beginning to get from back in December are almost gone and when new pimples arise, they don't stay for very long (an this only happens during the time of the month). My face feels cleaner, looks healthier, and it feels great knowing I am using a natural product that is not harming my skin. Natural is definitely the way to go.Although Amazon does have this item listed at a relatively good price and it can be shipped Prime, I would suggest looking on TheBodyShop.com because they always have sales going on. They ship for free if your order is $50 or more. I personally bought multiple products from the site and they had a buy 3 get 3 free dealing going on so it was a great price!All in all, I would highly recommend this product. 1.7 oz might seem like too little, but believe me, a little goes a long way. You don't need a lot and I promise this will last forever. I have used this for about a month and I can hardly tell I have used any of it. I have a feeling this little container is going to last me about 8 months or so, maybe even more. Talk about bang for your buck! Thank you The Body Shop for this wonderful line, please do not discontinue!"
9959,"Anti aging facial moisturizer cream review_I received the moisturizer in exchange for honest review from Tomoson. I wanted to review a cream-based moisturizer. The product is not light but if you apply to much, it can get too heavy. use the pump sparingly when dispensing product. I love using the moisturizer with other instanatural products"
310,"Perfect for dry brushing!_I purchased this skin brush after learning about a technique called &#34;dry brushing&#34; (google it). It is supposed to increase blood flow, lymph drainage and help remove dead skin cells. If nothing else, it sure feels great! After reading the reviews, I chose to purchase this brush. It was just supposed to be my brush, but after seeing how good it felt, my whole family wants to use it (including my 2 year old). The bristles are coarse, but you are no supposed to use a lot of pressure. I was always told to only use the amount of pressure it would take to move a coin across the table. You just brush 2 minutes per day before showering and brush toward the heart (don't brush the face) using long gentle strokes. It feels great. I did see some reviews about the handle not staying on. The wood handle needs to be turned over and inserted that way, which is opposite from the way that you would expect the wood to slide in to the back of the brush. I made that same mistake when I got the brush, but turned the handle over and slid it on that way and it has never fallen off the brush since. The company should really put that on the instructions because I had initially thought that mine was useless as well. I would definately recommend this brush if you are looking for a skin brush. The price is reasonable. The handle is long enough to reach the back. The bristles are made from tampico fiber, which is the unbleached stem of the agave plant. The instructions say to clean the brush periodically with soap and water. Happy brushing!"
889,"Thick Shampoo_Very nice shampoo- Lathers up thick and smells great- Washes out with ease- Love the way my hair feels after, very nice shampoo for thin color treated hair!"
4617,Great base coat!_Great product......goes on smooth and keeps polish in place. Shipping was great as well.
8667,"Not a good introduction to Keratin_My hair was keratin treated in September. By using the proper products, I have been able to extend the benefits of the treatment and still have smooth straight hair.I was really annoyed when I tried this. I thought I had checked thoroughly.  But after I had slathered this on my head I noticed that the front of the bottle said lower sulfates not sulfate free. The fine print is that it has lower sulfates than other Tresemme shampoos. It doesn't say how much less.Sulfates are death to keratin. Sulfates break keratin down. They will not only negate any benefit from keratin in the shampoo but if you have had a keratin treatment on your hair, this shampoo will ruin it. There is no benefit to be gained form the inclusion of keratin in this shampoo. It just uses the new buzzword.If you do not care about getting the benefits of keratin or protecting keratin treated hair this is actually an ok shampoo. It is not drying."
3975,"Omg! I love this brush_This brush is amazing. I bought more just because I'm afraid they will discontinue it. It's as good as my mac brushes... Perfect for applying foundation, perfect softness and density. Picks up makeup great, you can use this to blend or to stipple your foundation I do a mixture. I use mousse foundation and light powder on top and I get compliments on my foundation all the time and I have acne!!! I just tell people its all about the tools and the way you use them, and this is the best tool. very happy with purchase!"
8682,Almost 5 stars..._I've been using this product all week long along with the matching shampoo and conditioner.  I'm really loving how much better my hair is looking and feeling.My Hair- My hair feels so much softer and healthier now. It feels lighter too which is giving it better volume even when I don't use a hair dryer. The Serum is definitely helping to give that salon look.  My hair shines more and it's helping my curls look much better too.Frizz- This Serum is helping my frizz problem.  It's not improved it greatly but it certainly looks better.  The frizz just doesn't look as bad as it did prior to using these products.  If that makes any sense.  I have a bit less frizz than before but not a significant difference.Overall I'm really enjoying using the Keratin Smooth products.  I've noticed a big difference in the overall look and feel of my hair.  I would recommend using these products together.
1865,"Good for adults, too ..._I recently had to undergo surgery to remove a brain tumor which resulted in an incision from in front of my ear to the top of my head.  Everything went well, neurosurgeon preserved almost all of my hair, and recovery is going nicely, but I was told to use only baby shampoo until everything was totally healed.  I have hip-length thick curly hair that always tangles when I wash it, so I asked about using this extra conditioning 2-in-1 baby shampoo, and nurses said &#34;OK&#34; -- so that's what I used.I have to say, I'm REALLY impressed with this.  It's very gentle, of course, but it cleans nicely, and the extra conditioning component means fewer tangles.  After a few weeks, I also purchased the &#34;no more tears detangler,&#34; and the combination definitely works well.I've been using high-priced salon shampoos, conditioners, detanglers, etc. for years -- and I'm switching to this permanently.  It performs at least as well, in some cases even better, than most of the much higher-priced alternatives.  Who knew?"
7251,"Hair is straight and shiny!_I started using the Remington S8590 about a week ago. Until then I was using aRemington S9500 Salon Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Wide Plates, 1 Inch.The Remington S9500 and S8590 are essentially the same aside from the fact that the S8590 adds Keratin and the Smart Sensor. While I can't really tell if the Smart Sensor is making a difference, I think the Keratin is working. Why? Well, since I replaced my S9500 with the S8590 I've been getting quite a few compliments on how healthy and shiny my hair looks. Go figure! A flat iron making my hair look healthy.Both Remington flat irons feel great in my hand. Well balanced and sturdy. With the Keratin shine bonus, I'll definitely be using my S8590 daily and save the S9500 for travel."
7051,"Love this dappen dish with the stainless metal lid_What you see in the picture is what you get. They are perfect for putting alcohol in for gel polish clean up to remove gel from around your nail or acetone for regular polish, the lids help to keep the product from evaporating while doing your mani or pedi, easy to pore what you don't use back in the bottle. They are not for storage. I brought 3, I use two when doing my mani n pedi's one for my alcohol, one for my acetone when doing my pedi n I use the 3rd to soak my electric file bits in to keep clean n sterile. It's important to keep all your files n bits sterile and clean even if you are the only one using them,Would def recommend :-)"
7031,"IT REALLY WORKED...temporarily!!_I was so excited when (after very disciplined regular usage) I saw amazing results. But sure enough, after stopping, only a week or two later I was back at square one! It does work though, so if you have no problem using it for the rest of your life, or just need it for a time when you want those results albeit temporary, then go for it, you won't be disappointed. I only give it a low rating because I was hoping it would be a permanent solution."
1579,"Best Hair Dryer Ever Used_This hair dryer is amazing.  I never imagined there could be a hair dryer that would make my hair soft and shiny instead of damaging it.  I am fair with fine, curly hair that gets frizzy looking in the back if I don't really style it.  I tried this hair dryer in a rented condo, and it was so great.  I was going to order on Amazon because I could not find it in stores, then decided to try a Revlon model which sounded very similar in description and technology.  It was not even close to as wonderful as this Infiniti by Conair Nano Silver Tourmaline Ceramic Styler.  The only thing that would make it better would be a folding handle to make it more portable, because now I travel with it so I don't have to use cheap hotel hair dryers.  A retractable cord would also be nice.  The price was very reasonable for the quality of the product.  VERY SATISFIED and would recommend!"
1985,konad is the best_Just got the konad stamping set and some plates Im not a professional but it isn't hard konad plates are really nice
850,"Sophisticated and feminine_I fell in love with this perfume the first time I smelled it when it was released and have used it almost every day since. It's a sophisticated feminine fragrance. If you love bergamot (earl gray tea), you have to try this. It can be hard to find in department stores so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon."
902,NOT HYPOALLERGENIC._No where on the label or box is this product listed as hypoallergenic.  Many can expect allergic reactions.  Look for a product that is hypoallergenic if you know you are sensitive; that your eyes become irritated easily.
1736,"If I Could Give This Moisturizer NEGATIVE stars, I Would!_Let me preface that I've used both drugstore and department store brands and have never, ever had any allergic reaction whatsoever.I was encouraged by the positive reviews to give St. Ives facial moisturizer a try.EPIC mistake.Day 1: My neck (where I'd also applied the moisturizer) felt a little itchy and was a little red the following morning. That should've warned me but since I'd never had any reaction to 20+ moisturizers I've ever used, I ignored it.Day 2: was in a hurry and applied to my face only.Day 2 (evening), applied to clean face, neck and d&eacute;collet&eacute; after showering and 2 hours later, my neck was on fire. I washed my face/neck/chest immediately and skin still irritated, I tried not to scratch my neck that was the most on-fire itchy.Day 3: I woke up this morning to my face looking pink and a big red welt of a pimple (like an insect bite) on my jaw and patchy dry flaky skin along my chin and jawline.But the best? The BEST part is my neck that has angry, thick burgundy bands around my neck. The look like ligature marks, as if someone tried to strangle me with nylon rope.It's bad. Really bad. I hope this scariness fades before my birthday on Tuesday (it's now Saturday morning).It's so bad though, I think I'll look like a strangulation victim for my birthday party.While I've been disappointed by products or felt ho-hum by their performance, I've never felt my skin burned and DISFIGURED by one.This product is a disaster."
227,"Excellent_It's very refreshing and you can see the difference  when applied.  My face is refreshed , bright  and feels very clean and soft .  Thanks I love it."
4801,"My favorite curling iron out of the 7 I own_I love this iron. You can set and control the temperature levels.. it comes with a nice glove as well. The tapered end at the bottom lets you have tighter, bouncier curls at the bottom and allows you to easily make a curly beach look by brushing them through with your fingers. This is my go to iron!"
8926,"Love this blush set_This is a great deal, and so many colors to choose from. If you don't know what type of blush work on your skin tones. Then this is the set you want to get."
2407,Perfect!!!_This tool is awesome! Works perfect! I couldn't be more pleased!!! MUST have!!! The spooning on the tip is perfect!
5959,"Very good cleanser, not so much for the sun screen._I tend to break out more when I am pregnant, so I wanted to give this product a try to see if it would combat my chin break-outs during my current pregnancy.  The first thing I noticed was the scent of the cleanser.  It reminded me of lemon/lime alka-seltzer, which is a nice scent.  Due to my extreme nausea, the smell of many things makes me sick, and this product, happily, did not.  I have used the entire tube of cleanser over the course of about a month, and I can't say that it has improved my breakouts any, but they have not gotten any worse.  Aside from the spots on my chin, my face is very soft, and I have not noticed any discoloration/patches that I have had in the past. I have sensitive skin, and I have not had any problems with this cleanser, and I am very pleased with it.The sunscreen in this set is another story.  It is very thick and greasy feeling.  It has the consistancy of the zinc oxide that lifeguards wear on their noses.  It squeezed out of the tube like toothpaste, and although it was supposed to be oil free, it felt very greasy to me.  I never used the sunscreen, because I could just imagine how clogged my pores would be after using it, I would be a poster child for breakouts.  In short, I would happily purchase more of the cleanser, but not the sunscreen.  If they only way to get the cleanser is to buy this duo, I would pass."
9090,Great sitckers_These are fantastic nail art stickers that are very simple to use and that stay on your nails as long as you need them to (longer than your polish).  They're a bit of a pain to get off.
6639,"Wonderful trio_The colours are beautiful, The size of each eyeshadow is HUGE compared to other companies, the colour payoff is SUPERB. This is my first Shany purchase, and I will definitely buy more!!!For this price it's an excellent bargain."
7893,"Very nice_These came quickly and exactly as advertised. The beads were tiny so it was very easy to put them on the nails. No tweezers required, which made me happy (because I have a very low quality tweezer which doesn't work) . If you sprinkle them on your nails it makes a little mess. But if you dip them, it's fine. Overall I love these. This makes a good nail tip. :)"
2146,Great_This stuff is wonderful; my hair was totally unmanageable before I started using this product.I will be buying several more.
3760,"The HG product I've been searching for my entire life!_This is the best serum/oil I have ever used, hands down! I recently had my already dry and over processed hair cut into an A-line bob with balayage highlights. I was extremely worried about the bleaching due to a previous experience which took a few years to grow out and correct, but since I had my bf's cousin ( a Master Colorist and Stylist at Aveda) doing my hair, I trusted she wouldn't screw up. Luckily I was right and she did a MIRACULOUS job that took about 6 hours. I knew that I would need to find and invest in better products. I had had fantastic results with Joico's K Pak conditioning treatment in the past, so I was looking to repurchase when I came across this product. Based on all the positive reviews across the web, I decided to try it out and I am SOOO glad I did!As soon as I got it, I needed to try it out. I washed and conditioned my hair, dispensed 2 pumps into the palm of my hand and rubbed my hands together to emulsify. Starting at my ends on towel dried hair, I worked my way upwards so that the ends and lengths received more product than my roots. The scent is reminiscent of Argan oil but much softer and clean than the tropical and coconut scent I was expecting. The consistency is quite thick and similar to other oils I have, but is not overly greasy or slick like products with dimethicone. After applying my hair felt softer and more hydrated even though it was still significantly wet.I added a bit of my favorite volumizing mousse to my roots (Bed Head Totally Baked Volumizing and Prepping Hair Meringue) and blow dried my hair with a round boar bristle brush. I couldn't believe the shine and softness of my hair. I didn't even think it was possible for bleached hair to look and feel like that! It was as though the clouds had parted and angels were singing....seriously. It's that good. Even when using multiple products to fight frizz and dryness, my hair has NEVER looked as good as it did with just this one (okay 2, but the mousse doesn't really count here) product.The next test was the flat iron. I wanted to see how it would hold up without using my flat iron heat protecting spray. My hair slid through my flat iron MUCH more smoothly. My hair retained it's glistening shine and softness and almost seemed like it shaped and styled more easily somehow. I was really impressed and happy with the results.The next day, my hair was still shiny, still soft, and the styling had held up with no sign of being greasy or heavy. My hair had body, and bounce. My hair is extremely thick, so this was rather miraculous.This product has since taken the place of all the other serums and oils I have, and I really can't imagine ever going without it. I have had no problems with product build up, however, I clarify once a week anyway (which I recommend if you use products in general).I have since started using the correlating shampoo and conditioner in this Joico line and my results have been even better! This product is most definitely a MUST for anyone who colors their hair, has dry hair, dull hair, split ends, curly or wavy hair (sections of my hair are wavy, and other section are stick straight and nothing has worked like this to get the sections in sync), breaking hair, frizzy hair, hard to manage and style hair. A little goes a long way with this stuff, and the bottle is quite decent in size. I haven't even gotten close to half the bottle yet and I've been using it for a little over 2 months. Also, the pump twists to a an open and closed position, which is a BIG plus for me. No oozing product leaks!Buy it, it's amazing and will change your life!"
2368,"Really good-REALLY STRONG!_This stuff is STONG! I won't give a detail review-others have done better, plz read those! (Directions & tips on 'How To'!)This was not my 1st peel, I'd used 40% Glycolic Peels, AHA Peels for about a year before attempting this TCA Peel&#8230; I knew this would be different/more strong than the ones I'd used before & I was ready/forewarned!I followed the directions completely, the only thing that differed slightly was I wasn't exactly sure about the 'Frost'&#8230; When time time ran out, my face didn't look exactly like it should have! I looked more like a Zombie, actually! My face had more of a blueish tint. I was afraid to leave the peel on any longer, though. As I did NOT want to end up in ER; I ran to the sink & ended up splashing the peel off hysterically! @ 1st I thought I'd over-reacted, should've left it on longer! Then-- I'm glad I did, as apparently that blue tint WAS the 'frost' they were talking about! 5-6 days later, my face became leather-like, started cracking, then peeling.After which, everything happened as promised! Nice, soft, new skin beneath! I am waiting the 5-6 weeks until using again. If you use AS DIRECTED this can be a wonderful tool. The AS DIRECTED is the important part. Anything else is @ you're own peril. Good Luck! (BTW-Plenty of good tips on other posts!)"
6643,"Awesome_a total of 15 brushes and a case for only 25$ ! pretty cheap. the case makes traveling a lot easier, you dont have to worry about damaging or loosing any brushes."
4921,"So far, so good_Like Madonna, I like to change my hair color all the time (ok, so maybe lately she's kept blonde? hehe).I used to use permanents but what a pain when I get a color, then I don't like it after a few weeks, change it, and repeat cycle until my hair is fried?So, my stylist suggested semi-permanents to play around with. Naturally, I thought of products like Natural Instincts. But, the more I researched, the more I liked this product- why???1. The reviews claim it's more gentle2. It doesn't require developer so you can just add to your roots or refresh as needed and keep the rest in the bottle until you need it again without wasting money or product!3. You can mix colors to create new shades.4. Like others have mentioned, I also put a conditioner in mine to help with the consistency during application. My favorite is the leave-in conditioner by YEST to Carrots because it has keratin and argan so I'm getting a nice conditioning treatment while coloring.I want to give this 5 stars but they really need to add more shades to play around with. When I'm at Sally's, there are some brands with easily twice the number of semi permanent/demi permanent shades that I want to try but I really liked this product so I'll stick with it for now.Also, I wish they would provide some good ideas on what shades to mix and expected outcomes for those of us who aren't professionals. I like warm golden or reddish tones on my dark hair and so far have enjoyed Cedar mixed with light reddish brown or rosewood (tints my dark hair and goes well over my highlights or greys)."
5779,"Made my heart race!!_I bought this to lose some weight, boy It made me think I was having a heart attack. I flushed them down the toilet!  My daughter wanted to try them. I would never let her take them.."
6380,Great shower mirror._This is a really nice mirror. Shatter proof and well made. The two levels of lighting are really nice and can make a huge difference in a dimly lit shower area.It comes off the frame easily too and you can tilt it for people of different heights.
5434,"Helped with itchy skin condition_I have a bad back and after a couple of back surgeries I learned a number strategies that help my back feel better. One of them is a 10 minute hot bath every night really helps feel and sleep better.  Recently I decided to incorporate salts in my bath as they help various skin conditions, and I get scaly skin on my legs during the winter.San Francisco Bath Salt Company sells a large variety of different salt and I wanted to find out the difference between the different options. I found research from Maryland Medical Center which I found particularly helpful. They found that Dead Sea and Epsom salts showed beneficial effects on skin and neuromuscular conditions when applied externally by soaking baths. Both types of salts provide nourishing elements which absorb through the skin. Both showed similar benefits in their research. What is different is the actual nutrients contained in the salt.  The difference is explained by the source and composition of these salts. Dead Sea mineral salts comes from the Dead Sea, a saline lake located 400 meters below sea level in Israel. Epsom Salts (the name comes from Epsom, England where they were used first) are come from a variety of natural sources. Epsom salts contain high levels of magnesium and sulfates, whereas Dead Sea mineral salts contain high levels of magnesium, potassium, calcium chloride, sodium and bromide.I found particularly interesting how Israeli physicians use Dead Sea salt.  They prescribe Dead Sea salt for treatment arthritis, rheumatism, and psoriasis.  To reduce eczema symptoms they combine treatment with Dead Sea water therapy with sun treatments.San Francisco Bath Salt Company also makes scented salts. This turns the treatment with salts into a bit of luxury experience. If you like LavenderLavender Bath Saltsand if you prefer mint scentMuscle Soak Bath Salts.San Francisco Bath Salt Minera Dead Sea Salt comes in a resealable plastic bag. The grains dissolve fairly easy. I use my foot to swoosh the salt around to help it dissolve. My scaly itchy legs itch less after using soaking in bath water with Minera Salt.In addition to the use in the tub, I also tried using a bit of salt as skin exfoliator. It works nicely providing a gentle scrub and massage.I received an evaluation bag of Minera Dead Sea Salt from San Francisco Bath Salt Company for evaluation and an honest review.  Overall,  I like the effects of adding salts to my bath and will continue to use them.Ali Julia review"
6072,"Great product-It made my hair shinny and straight_I recommend this product.  For you all in the humid south, try it.  It's not expensive.It worked better than the expensive products."
4001,"I should have purchased more_When these were on sale I should have purchased more.  I really like this eyeliner pencil and the smudge end is very useful.  I had no issues with smearing or anything, and stays pretty much most of the day.  I also like the fact that the black color isn't VERY black, and it looks more natural than some black eyeliner pencils.  I would definitely buy again."
8039,"Works just as I'd hoped, to reference my gel polishes._This display is ideal to display and catalog my 26 gel polishes. Amazon is the best place to get them, and there are some that I have not had the chance to see for real, so in order to be able to see their real colors and compare them, this display has been invaluable. If it's put on binder rings instead of its own holder, enclosed, the nail polish or gel polish colors can be rearranged by color, or brand, for example, so this display chart is a boon to reference librarians whose career ambitions were frustrated. The clear plastic is also superior to white or milky &#34;fingernails&#34; in variations you may see on eBay. On this swatch stick you can see whether the polish is opaque or whether another coat is needed. White or natural swatch sticks make it seem that polish is opaque in very few coats, and give erroneous information."
4022,"Next best thing to a doctors chemical peel_You have to work up to this strength.  Definitely don't start off with this number.  I've been doing at home chemical peels for years.  I've had the dermatologists peels too.  They can add up.  $$. I like to be able to do them in the comfort of my own home.  I use this 1-2 times a week.  I'm 49.  It helps with wrinkles, freckles, brown spots and discoloration.  I'm ready to go up to the next strength as I can leave this on for 15 minutes now.  The best thing to do is exfoliate between peelings but be gentle as your skin is a bit thinner.  I will definitely keep using this product."
7909,"Love this thing_Okay, so I don't use it as a purse organizer....I am an avid (or as my DH likes to say...Rabid) Knitter. Always have a knitting project with me. And occasionally it's tangled up with a comb or wallet in my purse. (Ooooo bad knitter! BAD!)So when I spotted this I ordered immediately. Work like a charm...pattern in one pocket, needle sizer in another, extra needle tips & cables securely zipped in a long pocket & the center reserved for the all important Knitting project. And plenty of more pockets for whatever.  Fits neatly inside most of my tote style bags and when the need arises I carry it by itself.  Can't say I'm wild about the canary yellow & grey thing but HEY - this thing WORKS!P.S. great price & fast shipping. Came from Shanghai way faster that I expected."
3423,"This topcoat has changed my attitude about nail polish._It's almost too good to be true. This stuff really protects a fresh nail polish job far beyond what I thought possible. It can still get some dents and deformities if heavily stressed in the first couple of hours, but within a few minutes, the finish is virtually impervious to most light dings and bumps. Absolutely amazing stuff.I wear nail polish a lot more often now because gone is the frustration of a ruined manicure because I couldn't sit not using my hands for anything at all for two hours.I did recently ruin a fresh manicure because I made the bed within about 20 minutes of applying Seche Vite, which smooshed the polish at the tips, so I now have a pretty good idea what I can and can't get away with. I got over-confident because it felt completely dry to the touch, but actually it remains a little soft for a few hours while it cures, so you still need to be a little careful. Ideally, I do my nail polish sometime before bed, let it dry for about 15 minutes and after that I can go to bed and not get sheet marks."
792,"smell is too strong!_I was a little skeptical of the reviews that said the smell was too strong for this hair conditioner because it had so many other good reviews; however, if you dislike scented hand creams, do not purchase this product. It seriously gave me a headache because the smell is so strong! Flowery sweet smell' yikes! On the other hand, if you like strong flowery smells this product could be just for you."

6506,Liquid Gold_I massage my scalp with this oil.  I make sure I keep a bottle in my frige.  Something is making my hair grow this must be it.  I do like this oil using a little the smell is not too bad especially with the whipped ginger cream.  thank you.
544,"Transformed my hair!_A year ago I quit using chemical products in my hair, because of hair loss & damage. I had been using other natural shampoo & conditioners, until they either became unavailable or stripped my hair. I've ordered several different conditioners from Aubrey and love this one the most. It is the scent that is so light & feminine, plus the conditioning power of this stuff id amazing! I put it on with a shower cap an hour before I shower, then shampoo & condition again. When I brush there are no tangles, very little hair loss & my hair is so silky, shiny & full of life! The other day a friend asked if I had dyed my hair because the natural color is coming back out! I also have the shampoo that goes with this condition & it works great to get my hair clean.The softness, shine & life this stuff brings back into you hair is literally amazing.I will not put anything else into my hair again after using these products. The conditioner is thick, yet it does not weigh down hair. I have medium thick, dark, middle of my back Latin hair. This works great for me & my grandmother who has short, dyed hair.The scent isn't too overpowering, and doesn't linger. In my opinion this one smells the best.Update 7/24/13I stopped using Aubrey products in my hair about 6 months ago & started trying out the salon brands (Chi, Sebastian) Chi worked very well in my hair, but the price is so expensive that I couldn't afford to keep buying it. Then I went to store brands like Herbal Essences & Garnier. The only one I have stuck to is Garnier because the ingredients are partially natural & the shampoo doesn't dry my hair out so bad. A few days ago I started using Aubrey conditioner with the Garnier shampoo & my hair is actually softer, shinier, easier to manage & doesn't feel so brittle. When I stopped using Aubrey my hair was getting very brittle, dry & had so much split ends that I had to cut 3 inches off the length. I didn't think it would make a difference if I stopped using Aubrey in my hair and tried something else, but I guess it did, because I didn't change anything else but the product I was using to cleanse & condition my hair. Now I am using Garnier shampoo, Aubrey conditioner & a wonderful whipped mouse from Bamboo. My hair is shiny, silky & less fall out since going back to Aubrey.Everyone's hair & budget are different. If you have great luck with Aubrey that is wonderful, I did have a great experience but after a few months my hair was getting weighed down by the conditioners & I tried about all of them to see which one would stop my hair from being so weighed down. My cousin owns a hair salon and told me to change up my brands of shampoo/conditioner every couple of months to keep my hair from getting weighed down & used to a certain product. I've done that since stopping using Aubrey within the last 6 months & it worked. I have given my hair a break and now am just using the Aubrey conditioner everyday."
3579,Shea Butter Heaven_I am very pleased with my order of shea butter. It was 3 lbs worth and less than I would have paid at whole foods for raw shea butter including the shipping. It is fresh and the seller made sure it fresh from a shipment he or she had just received. Very happy customer and will continue to order from them based on my first experience!!!!!
9573,"A review of the 1mm size from a first-time user_I'll admit I stared at the needles for almost 2 weeks before getting enough courage to try this since I accidentally ordered the 1mm size instead of the 0.5mm size. But once I tried it there was far less pain than anticipated. Not pleasant but at least no blood! I have a very low pain threshold. I rolled right before bedtime, applied a hyaluronic serum, and went to bed feeling like I had a slight sunburn. Thankfully my redness subsided by the time I got up in the morning. I'll use this once a week at first, but I do recommend starting with the 0.5mm needles if you have sensitive skin like I do. (No change yet, but it can take months before you notice a difference). I'm late 40's, with dry, sensitive skin.  ~~~~~sample provided for review~~~~~"
5807,"I like it!!_So far I really like this.  I was burned and need to exfoliate regularly.  This works great, it has two speeds and the multiple heads are great."
8022,"Awesome water resistant mascara!_A fan of the Covergirl Lashblast Volume in Waterproof, I decided to try this guy out and was glad I did.  It's an affordable mascara offered on the site and you can sometimes even get this for cheaper with a Covergirl coupon that Amazon likes to give out.  This was exactly what I needed to get beautifully separated lashes.  The formula was good and lasts throughout the day, and the brush is awesome!"
5982,Just what I needed_A bit pricey but I love the convenience. I only use 3 and then move them to 3 other fingers while I work on the first three. By switching them back and forth I don't use so many. They hold the remover without leaking.
9475,"Ecotools Eye Enhancing Duo Brush Set_I love these brushes! They're soft and hold a lot of powder. They're comfortable, solid and sturdy. The Ecotools Eye Enhancing Duo Brush Set has made it's way into my daily routine and won't be leaving anytime soon."
4392,"GREAT FOR EYELASHES_I used to use Latisse, but it runs about $120.00 per month and, although I did see some improvement, it was not enough to justify the price. Then I discovered this product. After removing all makeup at night, I apply a bit to the lashes and lash line. I swear I see a difference - longer, thicker, and darker lashes. And it does not sting the eyes, or cause the slight skin discoloration that Latisse did."
5145,"Leaves my hair feeling filthy_This conditioning treatment moisturizes my processed hair about as well as most other deep penetrating masques have in the past.  But, this one is mainly made of mineral oil so it leaves a thin sheen of the oil even after copious rinsing.  The oil feels ok when you comb the wet hair (nice and slippery), and it doesn't immediately leave the hair stuck together and greasy, but it does make it tangle up and after a few hours it feels gritty and dirty.  I couldn't wait to shampoo it out.It was like getting sunblock in the hair plus a day of hiking in the dust.  Icky."
8135,"Matte Moisturizer_Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture! Satin Finish Lotion is a different kind of moisturizer than I'm used to seeing from Olay. It applies easily and dries to what I would call a matte not satin finish. It's not greasy at all and feels like a powdery finish when it dries on my face.I have to say that I don't like this moisturizer, not for my skin type. I have dry skin and am over 40 so I need a different type of moisture than this provides. I need a more moisturizing moisturizer. My skin looks even drier after applying it.It reminds me of an oil-control lotion. Gives that exact same effect, feel and look on my skin as does the ones that are made to control oil from the acne control brands.I think if you need an oil control moisturizer then this would be a good choice."
5949,Amazingg_An absolute must buy. Made such a noticeable difference to my hair as soon as I applied it. Felt soft. Gave it an amazing left wen blow dried. Love it!!
6984,Super Auto Soap Dispenser_Been using this dispenser and have been quite pleased with it.  It just drops the right amount of liquid soap.
1437,"My absolute favorite moisturizer_4 years ago I received a bottle of this as a gift and I have used it faithfully ever since. I love the smell, feel, the way it absorbs into my skin and most of all that it doesn't make my skin drier a couple hours after I use it. I freely admit I am a moisturizer snob, I've tried 1000s of different ones from drugstore to department store and this one is hands down the best. I have a bottle on my desk and everyone tries it and loves it, never had anyone have an allergic reaction."
1650,I Love it_I love this eyelash condition gel.  I use this first thing in the morning and then again at night.  My eyelashes get brittle in the winter and this helps to keep them moisturized.
7864,"nice clips_I really love these clips for sectioning small sections. I've noticed they don't have as good of a grip for a bulk of the hair as my professional ones that I use in the salon.. But really nice for control during haircuts, hair curling, etc..."
2255,this stuff is awesome_I love the desert essence brand. This tea tree oil blemish stick works magic. throw it on at the first sight of a zit and will definitely help the healing process.
4057,summer in a bottle_this perfume smells great! Reminds me of sunshine and water. The bottle is beautiful too...too pretty to put away I keep it out in my bedroom to enjoy the sea glass color of it!
3920,"Gold-plated cure_This serum - a medium I have not tried before - is especially formulated, apparently, for skin over 45 years old. My skin certainly falls into that bracket, and is beginning to plague me with the ravages of time, so I decided to give it a try. It specifically says 'for the face' but my arms also are depressing, so I use it primarily on them, and I have to say, with diligent use there is a difference. Nothing short of a regeneration machine would completely solve the problem, but if you want to be at least temporarily mollified about the appearance of your skin, this stuff does help. (It should, for its price.) One must maintain a daily regimen, however, to get any even semi-lasting results, and this is my failing - I am not always as faithful in application as I should be. The gold apparent in the content makes you feel a lttle more decadent, also."
4127,Cute!_I bought this to be silly and I ended up using it whenever I went to a rave party. Everyone commented on how cool it looks! A perfect shade of white and kind that I was looking for.
7259,"so helpful_these make eyebrow shaping a snap. they have 4 nicel shape and size configurations so you can use what fits your face. easy to follow and mine came out great, thanks, fast shipping time too."
4844,Worst ever_I have order a lot of gel products from u and the sheik white on is the worst product I ever received its very watery and runs all over your nail when using when your able to clean it up and cure it its very streaky and uneven color no matter how many coats u put on
859,"Obsession Night, A Great choice_I had read reviews on Obsession Night, I normally wouldn't order a fragrance without smelling it, However, I'm a big Calvin Klein fan, You will not go wrong with this fragrance or the price, I received it within 3 days of purchasing, and I put it on right away, I have been receiving compliments at least twice a day, Woman are continuously asking me what are you wearing? I tell them and the next thing I know, Four people have made a purchase for their significant others. I will be buying Obsession Night again,, Great for any man, and a super gift for the Holidays, It stays on and lasts all day, Can't go wrong, a little more subtle than Original Obsession, Nice refreshing undertones  and judging by my friends responce's a must for any mans fragrance collection!!!!!!!"
4047,"So pretty_yes, this is absolutely perfect. the colors go with each other so well! i would go and buy every single color. They are so worth it."
5653,"Nice_I love using them and I really like them, so I do recommend them to nail fashionistas. Also awesome for making flowers."
3619,"Q*Lumiere_I intitally received the Q*Lumiere Day Creme as a sample in my first Sweetsation Therapy order and within a couple of uses, I knew that I was going to purchase the full size bottle of it.  It immediately makes my face look soft and I love how my skin glows.  I love all of the Sweetsation products that I have tried and feel so thankful that I found this wonderful company!  Not only are the skincare items incredible, but their customer service is super nice and helpful!!  I would highly recommend this line to anyone! :)"
9110,"Comfortable, hot, no pulling_Heats up very quickly.  On/off and temp buttons are very clear and easy to use.  Lit temp display.Smooth inside, we used it on very long hair and there was nothing for hair to get caught on- there's no little cracks or ridges to catch hair, so it's very easy to use it without pulling hair.It works well.  I used a bit of spray on smoothing gel prior to use, and did about 1-2 passes per chunk of hair.  Hair came out very straight and smooth.It's comfortable to use, lightweight, and easy to grip.  Gets as hot or about as hot as my expensive Helen of Troy iron that I love so much- it says 230 on the gauge but that is in Celsius.  It's plenty hot enough to straighten hair quickly and well."
9662,"Not greasy_I love this gel moisturizer so much. It's affordable, isn't heavy or greasy, and I see an immediate improvement in the tone of my skin. It doesn't have an overwhelming fragrance and dries quickly. This is something I will keep buying."
7988,good Nail Art Nail Polishes_these nail art Polishes Are very Nice And Glittery and with dark and Some Neon Colors and the packageing was just right nothing was Broken and they work just fine
3905,"holly veriety; day, night, evening, smokey, nude, u name it_I go out with my friends every once in a while and when it comes to getting ready we all use my pallette in front of one big mirror (partay partay)but I also use this pallette for my everyday natural lookThis pallette has different shades and it is easy to work withalso these shades do last long (no maintenance needed and thats good, but we ladies still do our bathroom call for fun :P )I asked em to buy me another one, cuz they quite used mine up"
6021,Love it!!!_this soap does miracles mix this with the xtreme brite gel and you will see some amazing and statisfying results in  no time!!
6270,Not for me_The smell is very intense and yes oil based. It left my curls stiff. This product is not for me.
6921,"Talk about warming up the fat!_I didn't follow the directions correctly.  It says to apply a LITTLE on the area.  I didn't so it got really hot.  My bad.Once I tried it again the right way, I could feel the warm sensation on all the places I applied it.  I have one of those sweat bands for my stomach and this stuff really warms it up even more.  I would recommend this product, but please use it correctly. :-)"
566,"Great_I'm a longtime OPI user, but after trying Zoya, it's the only brand i buy now. I like that their polishes are free of toluene, formaldehye, DBP, and camphor. Even more importantly, it lasts longer without chipping on my nails than any other brand (about a week). My OPI topcoat was getting old and sticky, so I ordered this as a replacement.I would definitely recommend it--it goes on smoothly, dries quickly, and helps prevent chipping."
144,"Best Towels Ever!_This is the first Aquis Microfiber towel that I've purchased but I absolutely love them! These towels are very thin and lightweight, but are insanely absorbent and will get you dry in a flash (and all you have to do is pat dry very gently to accomplish this, there's no need for any harsh continual rubbing of your skin with this towel). Because of this, they're way gentler on skin and hair. They also dry rather quickly after use, so you don't have to really worry about any of the ickiness that usually comes along with soggy, damp towels. Just a note, it was strange to use at first because this towel doesn't glide smoothly along your skin like most towels do (which kind of makes it necessary for you to pat dry with it). It sort of sticks to you or grips you, if that makes sense. A bit weird at first but not a big deal. I love these towels and will not use anything else for my skin/hair again! Highly recommend, A+!"
7949,"Doesn't work for me either_I honestly wanted this to work and really didn't want to give it a bad review either because we all don't have the same scalp; however, the honest truth is that it didn't work for me. I started it Sept.21 and it is today Nov. 12 and nothing has changed. I followed the instructions to a 'T'. I was using it on my edges and nothing happened. I contacted the buyer who is also the seller and she stated to give it time also if you have chemical damage this will not help. I want you to know that I do not have chemical damage but trichotillomania which isn't a chemical burn. I know hair can grow there because I have little spuds even before the oil. I've tried this oil on other parts of my scalp and it still doesn't work. I've been using an other oil and it looks promising. I know it'll take a long time before hair is restored around my edges. Unfortunately, this product only works on scalp with hair already. It needs to start off with a healthy scalp. FYI It's important that you remove the gunk and buildup on your scalp for any product to take place and help grow. I've done that and this product still didn't work."
255,"Effective_I like this product very much, it does a good job of preventing heat damage to hair. I find I am able to run the hair dryer over a section of hair 3 or 4 times with the hair dryer so close it touches the hair, no smoke or bad smell emanates from the hair. It also is extremely light weight, I have never felt like my hair was too heavy or oily after using this product. The smell is pleasant too. The only cons are that I have to use 4 pumps to feel like it has totally covered my head, this has lead me to use 30% of the bottle from December 26th to February 26th, and I wash my hair 4 times a week. Perhaps I could be more conservative and still get the same effects, but it is hard to tell how much hair is covered because the product is so light weight. ."
9904,"I swear it's like magic for your skin_It's no secret that I love, love, LOVE vitamin C serums - and this one is no exception! Lately I have been getting so many compliments on my skin. A few days ago a woman that I know even remarked that she could not believe I was 40 - she thought I was in my early 30s! I am giving credit to using Vitamin C plus Hyaluronic Acid Serum. I swear it's like magic for your skin. My skin is so hydrated and beautifully smooth, I am really blown away. Fine lines around my eyes have even seemed to disappear. Natural and Organic ingredients.Shipping and Packaging: this product was shipped in a timely manner and received no damage during transit."
2832,"******* IT WORKS ********_I used this MOST RECENTLY from June 2011-October 2011 as my nightly shower soap. I'm ordering it again because...I'm breaking out like crazy. I've lived in really humid, tropical areas (Florida, Hawaii, and New Orleans) and really dry areas (Flagstaff, AZ). This stuff works in all climates, killing off the crap without stripping your skin. In the interim, I've been using 10% Benzoyl Peroxide and not only are my bed linens and night clothes bleached out--my skin is dried out and breaking out. So, I'm back to Defense Soap. Buy it because you won't be disappointed. By the way, a little goes a LONG WAY. Unlike GymSoap, it is TRICLOSAN-FREE!"
4394,"OMG_That's the only way to describe it is OMG. Some of my hair came out because of heat damage, I stupidly was hot combing my hair sometimes twice a day and some of my hair said NOPE and bye bye. I was devastated, one side was the shortest it's ever been, a bit past my ear lobe. I did not give this a 5 because I'm still waiting for the extra umph that goes with JBCO but it's been less than a month and my hair has grown back. I am AA with SLOW growing 4b hair so slow I can scream, I've mixed this product with pepppermint oil but I fully believe that my hair would not have grown back as quickly as it has with this product. Did I mention how SLOW my hair growth rate really is? It is thick so I diluted it with a melted hair growth grease, rub it in every night, and braid my hair into 2 braids and take it out in the morning. This is 'THE' miracle product! I fully believe my hair would still be short if I wasn't using this product. This is a must get for all women!"
9523,"Good value and pleasant smell_I've become a fan of the Suave Professionals products--I adore the Moroccan Infusion line--and this fits in well with the Suave brand.  The scent is fairly light and pleasant: somewhat spicy, somewhat floral.  The shampoo is a bit thicker than the conditioner and lathers nicely.  It's pleasant to use and gets my hair clean.I recommend using this shampoo with the coordinating conditioner."
8283,"Silkier But Not Shinier_This is a pleasing shampoo with a luxurious lather.  It has a lush scent is hard to identify, rather tropical floral with undernotes of vanilla and maybe coconut.  It rinses easily and left my hair clean, soft and well behaved. My hair did feel silky but I did not notice any increase in shine.Argan oil has been the craze but I can't say it made a noticeable difference. However this shampoo is competitvely priced, cleans gently and rinses clearly. While I enjoyed no increased sheen my hair did feel silkier. Recommended"
7163,good price_I've been using this color and purchasing it from Wal Mart for much more money.  I was very excited to find my regular hair color for 1/3 of the cost.
2260,Fixes things_This does a good job of restoring Seche Vite (which thickens quickly) and also old polishes that don't dry any more.
8021,"Great formula_I'm very impressed with Clump Crusher...it's probably the best Cover Girl mascara I've ever tried. It definitely gives me great volume, without flaking or clumping at all. I like a more dramatic eye, and I need at least three coats of this mascara to do the job, but my eyes look great after three coats, and again, no clumps. Love it, especially for the price!"
5316,Didn't work for my skin type._That's about it really... I didn't see a significant decrease in my acne when using this product. I needed a more aggressive scrub.
5570,"Nice addition to Shellac._I was excited that CND was releasing a more 'flaky' glitter - looks fantastic over Black Pool, and gives a normal french manicure a little bit of pizzaz. If you want more glitter, I would suggest 2 coats instead of 1, which can start to get a little thick if you're not careful - make sure if you're going to do this, you apply your color coats on the thin side."
1102,"Love this perfume!_This smells so wonderful, I get compliments all the time asking what I'm wearing.  It's sexy yet not overpowering.  A little is all you need."
2753,"Noticeably Firms Skin_When I tell people my age, they invariably say: 'You don't look that old.' I have to agree that at almost 43 I should be getting some wrinkles but nothing obvious has occurred. My skin is fairly sensitive and has combination skin problems. But when I use this creme as I have for years I must say that I'm impressed with the results. I also use this on my neck daily. However what I really love about this creme, besides the anti-aging effects, is that it is 100 % vegetarian and cruelty-free. I have tried many of the DermaE products and have found them all to be superior to anything I've ever used. I think the results are wonderful and the price is one I can afford. Use this along with Derma E Pycnogenol Eye Gel. It now comes in a handy tube instead of a jar.~The Rebecca Review"
9764,"Great Color & polish consistency_This is a great Spring color! It is a mint, but not as light as the image shows. It's only a bit darker than the Sally Hansen Mint Sorbet."
7541,"Lovely, Organic Argan Oil_I've been fooled by the 'Argan oil' label before only to find out that Argan oil is minimally used.  Savanaah's Organic Argan Oil is 100% organic Argan oil.  I use it on my hair and on my face.  I love it!  Period."
9012,"Love it_Awesome shade of green. Sorry zoya: I had planned to buy a Bunch more colors this summer but, I don't need any other color. I love it!"
6334,"Love It_This is a really nice tool to use for putting on the dots and I do mean it works good, I enjoy putting on my nail polish and then my Rhinestones. Make my nail look beautiful."
6268,"Non silicone based defrizzer_I have very coarse, wiry and frizzy hair.I usually use Moraccanoil, however this is a very nice alternative.It s meant to be used on wet hair prior to blow drying.It has an oily texture but no silicones to weigh down my hair.Their s a strong floral France which did not bother  me.It helped control some frizz and made my blow dry easier.It might be too heavy fine very fine hair."
8408,I love what I got but be careful!_These are the best for getting konad style plates for a fraction of the cost. They all work great with the exception of misspelled merr0y christm0as and a horse that has too thin of lines to tell what it is I love them. The patterns are fun and everyone I show them too finds something they like. The only caution I have is that I was sold plates 1-60 and got 1-40 and 51-70. 51-70 did not match the picture of the overlapping plates but I believe they have fixed that. Even with the bugs these are 100% worth every penny and more considering the plates from konad are ~$650.
7643,"pump dispenser for nail polish_Item took awhile to get here, but for the price and cost of shipping, it was worth the wait.  I saw these used in salons, and thought I could use it at my home, for in between manicures.  I like it - it is functional and easier than using the nail polish bottle.  I would buy again from this seller."
791,"OMG this stuff is magic_Let me start off by saying....I have the most nappiest most kinky hair anyone could ever have, it doesn;t get any worst than my hair, I'm Jamaican American and I have a medium afro du. I have used a few products these past few months and I finally researched whats good for natural hair after having so many products make my hair more dry and brittle and unmanageable I came to this leave in conditioner, Dr. Miracles leave in conditioner destroyed my texture and made my hair hard to manage but this one was great, I washed it with the Shea Butter Shampoo plus Conditioner and After wards put this stuff and did two stand twist, woke up this morning and undid twist and let's just say it stretched my curls, made them soft and manageable and my hair feels so good! I love this product, yes it's alittle pricey but well worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
9307,"Too Many Side Effects_I have never used a product like this before, but my hair is thinning due to aging, and since it was free, I thought I'd try it.  After I got it and read about all the side effects, I decided not to use it.  I don't want to take a chance that it could cause a heart attack as I am well past middle age and have had some symptoms already.  Also, the unwanted hair growth, unexplained weight gain, hands and feet swelling suggest that it is an allergen or a hormone or interferes with hormones.  I am taking hormones now to balance my body, and I don't want to take anything that will interfere with the good results I have gotten.If I were younger and had hair loss, I might be willing to take a chance, but at my age it's not worth it.  There are other good alternatives in the form of wigs, hair extensions and hair pieces that I can use to mask thinning hair without using something that might be a health risk.  They don't cure, but they do a heck of a good job of masking the problem so that an older woman can feel as self-confident about her looks as she did when she was young."
5093,Delivery of package was bad_This item came in a box with my other items.  This item spilled all over the inside of the box and was leaking outside of the box.  The top was completely off the top.  I wish someone would have made sure the top was screwed on tight before shipping.  Now I only  have like half the product in the bottle
1121,A REAL PRETTY COLOR_WILL BUY ANOTHER COLOR  GOOD PRICE IT KEEP YOUR LIP NICE SMOOTHBUY IT GOOD DEAL PRETTY COLOR LAST LONG TIME
4102,"Wonderful eyeliner!_I have never used gel eyeliner before but I decided to try this one out because of the reviews. Turns out, it really does last all day! I use the ELF Primer ($1.00 at Target) and it literally stays on all day long! The brush is also very easy to use. Will definitely by again."
4021,"I thought 70% would be too strong_Well I just recieved my item today and as soon asI recieved my 70% glycolic acid I rushed to the bathroom set up everything and begain my peel. This is not my first time using a glycolic peel but I decided to try a stronger/higher dosage, I was using 30% which was ok.I am African American with very light brown skin so I was skeptical starting at 30% and jumping way up to 70% (without diluting it with water) but man am I glad I did!!!!:) I see way better results with just one application of this stuff..now I dont recommend to anyone else to do what I did, I was desparete because 30% was ok and I had good results but with this peel I can tell the results will be excellent. My pores are way more small and my skin is glowing..I have a long way to go before I see even better results but like I said this product has shown excellent results with one use so I know my next peel will be really great....I recommend this product it's great.Update:  My deep pocket craters are 95% gone with the use of my Glycolic peel and the Jessner peelthat I used a fewdays afterwards....it was told to me that craters could not be removed and that I would have to get facial fillers for the rest of my life. I am beyond happy with this product and I will purchase again, this product really saved me from getting expensive facial fillers every six months."
8456,Great deep conditioner_This is a great deep conditioning mask that helps your hair get extra moisturized.  It's great for occasional use and takes about three minutes to set while in the shower.
2972,"Waste of money_It's a good thing that I didn't pay a whole lot for this stuff, as it's useless.  I've used it for several weeks now and it hasn't improved my deep wrinkles one bit!"
9439,"Adds Colour And Shine but Subtle_I normally wear a warmer color on my hair but I have been trying to get the red out of my blonde hair so my hairdresser put more of an ash color on my hair at my last appointment. I haven't been happy with the color so applied the John Frieda Refreshing Colour Gloss in warm blonde hoping that it would make my hair look less ashy. It actually worked. The results are very subtle but it really did add a warmer sheen to my hair.The product is an in-shower wash-in/wash-out product. You wash and condition your hair as normal apply the John Frieda Refreshing Colour Gloss. Saturate your hair, let sit for at least 3 minutes then wash out. You should do it weekly and the bottle contains enough for 6 applications.The results are subtle but if you're needing a boost of color and shine, it does that."
5726,Leaves a beautiful finish_This brush does a beautiful job of applying liquid foundation.  The bristles are soft and leave a lovely almost air brushed finish.  The only downside to using a brush such as this is the fact that it must be washed and it must be washed often.  You do not want bacteria brewing on something that touches your face!  I have had my brush for two months and wash it every other day or so using a gentle body wash and it is still in just as good of shape as it was when I purchased it.  I have not experienced any 'shedding' and it holds its shape well and is still very soft against the skin.  It's a high quality brush and definitely worth a buy if you use a liquid foundation.
3814,"Great for Performances_Our dance company has used this for a long time and for sure, whatever color you need, its in there and for a good price."
8658,"lightly scented and long lasting_Dove Men+Care Cool Silver Antiperspirantis a great antiperspirants/deodorantIt has a pleasant scent that's very light and not overpowering like some deodorants can be.And if definitely is long lasting. With me, most antiperspirants/deodorants, I apply some after I shower at night and usually by morning, I have to apply more. This one kept me fresh throughout the next without having to apply it againI like"
348,Hides roots well._Great product for inbetween hair dyeing. I found that if you wet your hair the application is much easier than wetting the stick. Color goes on nice and easily and stays on well to hide any growth from your natural hair color. This is a great quick fix for me if I'm heading out and notice some roots or if I get too lazy to dye my hair it's great for the inbetween time frame.
3231,"These reviews should not be based on online price_The cream does what is suppose to do; of course, with realistic expectations in mind. It will diminish redness or red spots with time. I used it for old acne scars and they faded a bit. I have not used any other product for that, so I am assuming it was not my regular moisturizer that I use now. Now my boyfriend uses my tube, because he would get rosecea outbreaks once in a while and this cream is actually recommended for that. Just the idea that it is a non-irritant and neutral is already comforting to him, and is enough for us to keep buying."
7965,AmAzing_Pros: It covers up all scars and blemishes and works with sensitive skinCons: it dries out skin... so i don't use it everyday
3485,"PERFECT!!!_I love it, after watching some reviews on YouTube abut this eyebrow kit, I almost cancel my order, I was so afraid that this kit was going  have reddish tint, I was wrong, this is perfect brown, this does not have any reddish tone in it."
2718,"Mild scent, non greasy, absorbs fast_It's another mild lotion from Vaseline, this time with a mild 'masculine' scent.  If you use a lot of lotion at one time, the scent can be overpowering. If you use it sparingly, it's not bad. The lotion absorbs pretty quickly and is non greasy."
5852,Smooths and Protects_I really like this tinted moisturizer.  It is a little heavier than I am used to using but once it is on I don't notice.  I was worried about the size but a little goes a long way so it hasn't been an issue.  Overall a great product that I use every day.  My husband says it doesn't look like I am wearing makeup but my skin looks smoother and more even.
3165,Love it!_I wasnt sure if this would work but I tell ya It truly does I seen a diffrence within minutes of my lips. :)
6388,great blending brush_great blending brush for the price... def worth getting this rather than the mac one which is much more expensive
1599,"Colorless is best..._This adhesive works fabulously!  I am new to the world of false eyelashes and am very thankful that there is adhesive that is colorless when dry!!!  I'll get the hang of it...There are alot of adhesives out there, but in my experience I really love this product!"
9738,"Lovely scent-easy open top_The Caress Emerald Rush Body Wash is quite nice. It is made by Unilever and produced in the USA. It has a lovely and very light scent &#8211; does not linger, not too heavy like some bath soaps/washes. The scent comes from an infusion of &#8220;gardenia and white tea essence&#8221;. It is not as creamy as some brands, but at the same time, it does not dry out my skin and it has a rich lather that does not leave skin feeling oily. It does not seem to dry my skin like some bath wash or soap brands, and I tend to have dry skin so this in important. The plastic container is easy to hold and has an easy open flip top - very convenient."
1171,Best sponge ever!_This sponge blends makeup extremely well! Even if I use a brush I still find myself using this sponge to get a more flawless blend. Works great with liquids and powder. It sets like a powder puff without looking cakey or too dry. It gives a nice finish to the powder when using to set. I wouldn't suggest it being wet but after dampening it (which I do before showering) let sit and after using the bottom side to blend foundation use the elongated side for setting powder. Also works great for blotting and touch ups.
1252,Not too stiff for me_Yes...it looks like a toilet brush but it is definitely not too stiff.  Like any body brush...you have to go very light over the areas where your skin is more sensitive (like your chest area).  I am very happy I purchased this...does the job and its easy to us.  I don't use it wet...I use it for dry brushing my skin.  I brush my skin all over (brushing in the direction towards the heart from various parts of the body) to help exfoliate my skin and improve circulation.  I find it to be very relaxing...and I am thankful that I need not apply pressure in order for the gentle exfoliation to happen.
9185,"Great Lotion_This lotion has really helped prevent stretchmarks for me. I have read stretchmarks are genetic, in which case I should have some, but Mama Bee Belly Butter really helped prevent them (plus drinking lots of water!). The lotion seems to look and smell different than when I first bought it three years ago, but I feel that it still works as good. The smell used to be sweeter, like honey, but not anymore; it does not smell bad, just different."
9437,"nice for touch-ups, does not replace getting your hair dyed_This is a really soft blonde color.It's good for in-between maintenance of the color, but only the slightest touch-up. I first tried it at the end of the dye cycle when there were a ton of grays, and it didn't really cover the gray. Instead, it turned the gray color really light, which was indistinguishable. When I tried it as an in-between treatment only two weeks after the full head dye, it worked quite well.Beware that depending on your hair length, you might not get six uses out of the bottle (the instructions indicate that one ounce should be used per application)."
1161,"Enjoy_I'm so glad that my hairdresser introduced me to this brand. I like it even better than Pure ology! It makes my hair so soft and healthy. It is significantly cheaper purchasing it on Amazon, especially if you Subscribe and Save than purchasing it from a Salon."
5303,"i didn't give it 5 stars because I am still not certain about the results.  I have been using it nightly for several months._I still can't be certain about the results, if any.  However, it isn't greasy and lasts a long time.  When I awaken in the morning, I don'[t glow or look moisturized, but I notice that under the eye area, there is less lines and no puffiness.  The price is fantastic and since it contains sufficient retinol, will stick with it for a few more months."
3781,"Bye bye blackheads!_I struggle with blackheads. I've tried everything you can name that's a cleanser from gels to masks, you name it. I was so freaking happy though when I used this tonight. about 75% of my blackheads were gone!! I almost cried, it was so weird. I was not expecting it, but it was great. I still had some left, but anything that helps. Before I was using those stupid Biore Strips that got like two blackheads... Yeah."
4902,"Love this product_I absolutely love this product, it leaves my hair so soft and it smells amazing. I also use the One 'n Only Argan oilLove this product line"
8633,"Worth Getting the Conditioner_I love the smell of Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Shampoo. That's the first thing I noticed, it's not feminine, so men won't have complaints using it, it's just light, citrusy, and appealing. The scent stayed well into the afternoon too, so it's not the type of shampoo where the scent disappears as soon as you've dried your hair.We have soft water and there are shampoos that seem tough to get decent suds from them. That wasn't the case. I used about a teaspoon and was able to lather my hair completely (medium-length). It also rinsed away quickly, another plus.The bigger test for me is the promise of 'weightless moisture.' It's winter where I am. We've been in a deep freeze all week with nights at -10 to -15 below and days not getting out of the single digits. This dries my skin and hair out quickly. My hair's usually hard to tame anyway -- very thick and curly. I've tried many shampoos over the years that promise to add moisture just from using the shampoo, and few of them deliver. I was surprised with Nexxus. I deliberately skipped using conditioner to see how much moisture really would be there. I won't say I felt comfortable completely skipping using my argan oil, but my usual trio of shampoo, conditioner, and argan oil as a finisher was unnecessary. I didn't have frizz and my hair definitely had plenty of body and shine.Given that, I am going to get a bottle of the conditioner because I think it could become my favorite shampoo of all time."
2856,Is nice but..._It is nice.. but.. I prefer liquid soap.. because you don't have to keep it in a dish or soap holder
5732,"Absolutely Love It_After I bought this brush, I ended up buying two more by Chapman. Why? The bristles are soft enough to feel great against my skin, but firm enough to hold their shape. I'm amazed at how the brush spread an even coat of powder across my face with little effort required. I love this brush, and you will too."
2507,"Amazing!!!_This cologne is not strong. Its not moderate. its very light, it requires about 3 sprays in order for you to actually smell it. Still for 3 bucks ! this cologne is amazing quality. Outstanding product. This cologne though has an outstanding fresh smell. Girls will be all over you mark my words."
6804,Overall GREAT_This is the best top coat and base coat for gel nails. It makes my gel nails last for over 2 weeks. I don't need to go to the nail salon anymore to get it done. It gives and sets my nails the best and it's a great deal. I highly would recommend
1092,Best Moisturizer_I have been using this moisturizer for over a year now.  I purchased this for my daughter who lives in another state. The shipping was free and I wanted her to try it.  She loves it too!  It is non greasy and makes your skin look and feel beautiful.  I also have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate it.
4901,"Some of the best out there_I really like this product.  I was stuck on using department store brands thinking that the more expensive the better.  Now that I have found this, I will not be going back.  This works better than what I was using. I noticed my fine lines were smoother using this than with the other brands.  I did not notice a brightening but definitely a line smoothing. It's got a great botanical smell and feels very hydrating when you put it on.  The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is 2 minor cons: #1, the pump is a little stiff and a sometimes it would squirt out much more than I needed. #2, when the tube ran out and didn't pump anymore it still felt heavy as if there was still a good amount of product in there.  I hate the feeling that I'm wasting it!  It's too good to waste!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone.UPDATE: I broke open the tube and did find a little bit still in there, about another weeks worth of product. Also, I received my new order and the pump on this tube is less stiff than the first one. It must have just been a stiff pump for my first order.  This one is much better. I love this product!"
1760,"You can find cheaper_These eyebrow pencils are alright if you're not very heavy handed when it comes to applying makeup. The color does fade throughout the day and lasted me about six hours before I noticed that I had to &#34;retouch&#34; my eyebrows. If you do your eyebrows everyday, these will not last very long."
6497,"I'm In Love with these brushes!_Even though they may seem kind of short, that are really perfect!!! I love these so much, the quality should not be depicted by the price... I would recommend this to anybody!"
6096,CK ONE..........SHOCK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!_CK ONE SHOCK for Men is a very good smelling Cologne.got a type of a mild vanilla/spicy smell which is nice.Lasting power of this one I would rate at around 4-6hrs MAX which is not bad at all.Price wasn't bad either at around $40 for a 3.4oz bottleYou can use this Cologne as a Splash-On ...or it comes with a Spray Cap Also.Thanks Amazon !!!
9669,"This stuff is great. I put it on after washing my face ..._This stuff is great.  I put it on after washing my face in the morning, underneath my moisturizer and makeup.  It has a light scent that disappears after a few moments when it dries.  It's really light and you can't feel it after application."
5952,"Keeps tangles out of my hair_Garnier Fructis Triple Nutrition Conditioner is advertised for dry or damaged hair. I wouldn't say my hair is damaged, but I do always think it's a bit dry. The conditioner does its job detangling my long hair, the primary reason I use it.  As an added benefit, it also makes my hair feel more hydrated than usual without weighing down my hair and making it greasy.When it comes to conditioners, thick is better than watered down. Garnier is very thick -- thicker than any conditioner I've used in a long while.  The scent is strongly acidic citrus, as if to match the rich texture. If you are sensitive to scents, that might be a bit overpowering. It does fade quickly, though. I don't notice it after I get out of the shower."
3764,"Easy Sinus Relief!_I've struggled with allergies, sinus problems and sinus pain for a lot of my life. Icing it seems to do the best for me and to provide quick relief. I've had eye masks before, but they were gel, and tended to go &#34;thin&#34; in certain areas and no cold would be applied in those areas. This one doesn't do that. I can use this one on the eyes or forehead easily, and get relief.It doesn't stay cold as long as the sports pack, but it will hold itself on so if things are &#34;moderately bad&#34; I like this, if things are &#34;really bad&#34; I use the sports pack on my face instead.I haven't had any leaking problems as others have mentioned but I can see if you really squish it a lot it could be worn out. It's a little bit tempting to squish it a lot because the pearls are kind of attractive to watch!? Anyway, I avoided that and haven't had problems.By a lot of hard hours and days and years of time spent reviewing, I found myself in the top 10 reviewers on Amazon. This wasn't a goal or self promotion, but by nose-down focused reviewing. I occasionally get contacted by manufacturers or sellers who appreciate my way of reviewing and ask if I'll consider reviewing a product for them, with no obligation or cost. This is one of those products. I assure you that I review what I want, when I want, how I want, in order to share what I feel is the most accurate useful information."
7959,raw shea butter_This stuff is way greasy and do not see any results whatsoever. Total waste of money.If you are going to try it plan on wearing it at nightime only since you will look like a grease ball!
848,"Lovely Floral Fragrance_The back of the box says 'jasmine, gardenia and honeysuckle,' and that is what it smells like to me.  It may sound like something your grandma would wear, and she might.  But I fell in love with it at 21, and it's always been my favorite perfume.  It's intensely floral, but clean, not heady.  Very feminine, and yes, men like it."
1282,"It really works_I've had such a good experience with the Nioxin systems.  I get the #3 for my teenage daughter because she has more hair than I do, but we both love it and notice such a big difference between using it and using other shampoos and conditioners.  She's tried to switch to stuff her friends use before but she always ends up asking me to get Nioxin for her again.And the prices available on Amazon beat the salons every time!"
5894,Pretty tackle box_The SOHO Pro Texture Diamond Silver Beauty Case is well designed and functional.  It has so many shelves and compartments that make it easy to store and organize all of my makeup.  It is fairly durable and good for travel too.  I was surprised at just how much I could store in this case.  It's great to see the vanity surface in my bathroom again.
6707,Didn't work_I gave this as a Christmas gift. The recipient said one of the lights flickered and went out. None of the others lit. So not only do I need to return the gift I have the embarrassment of giving a gift that sucks. Very disappointed.
6736,smells lovely_Purchased these to take on vacation to a rented beach house.  Love the smell and the fact that they open and close for packing is helpful.  One of them did come loose in shipping when originally purchased which was very messy.
9474,"Use it for my BB creme here, but it could be a great all around facial makeup shaping brush/tool as well!_EcoTools  Skin Perfecting Brush: This is the first time I have heard of this company but I like their attitude toward caring for our planet.Indeed yes, there are brushes you can purchase which are comprised of animal hair, such as sable make up brushes, brushes made of Boar's hair, and so on.However, even if you are not vegan, not a member of PETA, not an animal lover, and maybe you just don't care about anything at all except your MAKEUP, I am not here to judge you,I am here to tell you this is a good, inexpensive, nice brush to use to assist you in applying your BB creme (I use this every time I apply mine) , or to use as a blush brush to shape the contours of that stunning visage of yours!I like this EcoTools Skin Perfecting Brush!  I hope you do too!Incidentally, I am not a member of PETA, and I am not vegan--but I have been a vegetarian for 9 years and if I had the guts I would be a vegan...for health reasons as much as anything else.I like to think that one tiny step at a time we will recover our dear planet. It is more complicated than a makeup brush, for sure, but that is a start.Thanks,jean"
6087,"Great for on the go!_This is a great sturdy little, case. I keep all my go to make up in here and when I travel or need to take my make up with me to a friends house its all in here and ready to go. I love that theres a mirror in it already so I don't have to worry about packing an extra one and it taking up more room."
5181,Recommended_Definitely helps keep unruly brows in place.
1296,"Great product!  Wish it would open easier._This mirror is exactly what I was looking for and I couldn't be happier......except if I could open it.  So far I have broken two fingernails and then gave up and have had my husband open it for me.  I am going on an extended trip and needed a mirror to take with me, not too small, but not too big.  This is perfect!  Just wish it would open easier.  Maybe that will come with more use."
8181,"I Saw No Change_Using this cream made absolutely no impact on my cellulite.  In my opinion, this is another gimmick that doesn't work.  It was an extra unnecessary step in my morning routine and add nothing of benefit, while taking up precious morning minutes and taking up precious space in my cabinet.  And as I am short on both time and space, I ended up throwing it away.I didn't like this product, however to be fair, I must say that my problem is pretty severe.  Someone with mild or moderate cellulite might get some use from it.  It didn't help me, though."
5324,Dove body wash_I gave this body wash four out of five stars because it doesn't smell as good as the deoderant does.
4983,"I like it_Pay attention to the size, because for this price you an buy a bigger size. I love the product and have noticed the difference."
8340,"This girl love her Axe man_This Axe face wash smells good, feels good, and keeps my guy's pores clean. I love the Axe scents and it makes me happy when he uses their products, sometimes they are a little stronger than I'd like but all in all I can't get enough of them."
707,Great developer._Great developer. Works good and fast shipping. if you have weak hair I wouldn't recommended the 40. But if you need a stronger developer this will work great.
6548,"Great for concealer_I don't know how I got along until I purchased this brush. It's great for buffing in concealer instead of using my fingers (which can often have the countereffect of pulling the concealer off my skin). Good quality with tightly packed dense bristles, I haven't had the experience of any bristles falling out, so I'm happy with my purchase."
2349,Works_This works well with my Gelish nail colors.  Makes it easy to wipe without leaving any residue behind or marks.
3824,Good pallette_This pallette is great!  It is very reasonable in price and it includes a great color variety!  Love this! Great for highlighting and contouring
7487,"excellent Shampoo for soft but manageable hair_This is a great shampoo.  Not only does it clean my hair nicely, but it leaves just the right amount of a very pleasant scent.  I am middle aged, and my hair is getting drier, and from the first use, this has left my hair softer.  I don't have dandruff, but my scalp is dry and will itch after using some shampoos, not so with this one.  One of the benefits I found it that it is a bit richer than some other brands, and being less watery, you can get results with a very small amount so that the bottle lasts much longer.  Since I wash my hair every day, I only use conditioner every other time, and that routine is working well for me.  This product reminds me of a salon quality shampoo at an affordable price."
1937,"Great light powder_I love this stuff.  My hair gets a little greasy after 24 hours, and I don't want to wash my hair every day or my fine, blond hair gets damaged.  This stuff is great, it is not heavy and sticky like some of the dry shampoos.  It is light and does not creat the pouffy look that some of the spray dry shampoos seem to try and create, it just seems to take away the greasies and leave your hair clean and smelling fresh.  The only problem is the only place I can find it is Sephora.  I wish they carried this product at more beauty supplies stores."
578,Great dryer at a great price._This is my third favorite. First is the Sedu and second is the Parlux. This is great for the price however.
3501,Not good_This adhesive is not worth it.  It is one of the lowest quality lash adhesives I have ever tried.  Does not hold anything.
7047,"Excellent product_I plan on continuing to order this product. This, along with my regular cleansing and moisturizing routine has provided visualimprovements in my skin. I have more &#34;mature&#34; skin now and this has really helped minimize small lines and dryness around the eyes and laugh lines.  Love this product."
8581,"WORKS GREAT_EXTREMELY STRONG, QUICK DRYING SO BE READY TO PLACE ONCE YOU GET THE TIPS READY. I DID ACCIDENTALLY GET GLUE ON THE SIDE OF MY FINGER AND ALMOST GLUED MY FINGERS TOGETHER! LOL SO BE CAREFUL IT DOESNT DRIP DOWN ON YOUR SKIN WITHOUT CLEANING IT BECAUSE IT IS STRONG!!"
1566,"Best Facial lotion ever!_I have sensitive skin and the past couple years, it's been prone to acne. I love that this smells good, it helps fight fine lines, I'm not putting toxic stuff on my skin and it makes my skin feel ultra soft. I honestly don't use this at night, I use it in the AM after using the Avalon CQ10 toner. Purchase it from Vita cost, it's cheaper."
1235,got rid of my scaly skin!_Got this at 8 mo pregnant and as of yet no stretch marks. But what I am really thrilled about was that I had developed red scaly patches on my hips that would not go away no matter what lotion I used. Just a few hours after using this the patches had all but disappeared! Now I apply once a day to the hips and they are no longer red nor scaly.  Plus twice daily on the belly to keep the skin elastic.it does take a while to absorb.It has an interesting scent that I can only describe as &#34;herbal &#34; or &#34;woody &#34;. I like it but if you prefer flowers or vanilla you may not like it.
7297,"Goes A Long Way_After a couple of times trying this out, I realized that it seemed like the amount that I'm used to using was a little too much. This bottle will probably end up going extra far for me.On the whole, I like that it doesn't have heavy scents like products for women often do. That makes it a little easier to handle than those on the days when my sinuses are being a little sensitive and I don't want to bother them with something really flowering. It works well as 2-in-1 products go. That means it's still not quite as good in my experience as using a really good conditioner separately, but obviously it's a lot more convenient (particularly if you're packing or a trip or planning to take a shower at the gym and don't want to lug a bunch of bottles around).On the whole, the scent is pleasant and mild, the shampoo and conditioner do their jobs very well, and the AntiDandruff ingredients they use are pretty much the standard stuff you'll find in other products in the category. It seems better and more pleasant to use than other products in its category, but it also costs more as well. If you want to keep your spending as low as possible, you'll be just fine with a generic anti-dandruff shampoo from a drug store or grocery store. If you're happy to pay a few dollars more to smell a little better and have hair that's slightly softer, this is worth a try."
5539,"smells amazing_I use this with the It's a 10 plus keratin shampoo, I skip their conditioner because the reviews for it were not outstanding.  To be honest, I don't miss the extra step.  This stuff works well and smells amazing.  Great detangler.  I have long hair and only put it on the bottom half, which is the only part that gets tangled anyway."
6205,Beatiful_Perfect pigment for spring. true to color. Stays I only reapplied because fresh it feels so creamy. The color stays all day long.
8531,"Quality_Nexxus products are generally excellent, and this Rejuvenating Shampoo is no exception. I love its aroma, and the rich lather that it produces. It leaves hair soft and clean, and I do believe that it's helped with the dry appearance that my hair sometimes takes on. At 12-15 dollars a bottle, it isn't cheap, but this price is not out of line considering the quality and results that this shampoo delivers."
2640,"Pretty_Perfect for my needs, as it has the option to unscrew the top for travel. It's an elegant design and well made."
4092,this foundation sucks_This foundation actually made my pores bigger. It made my face dry and it doesn't give enough coverage. I will not be buying this again.
2087,"Olay Definity Night Cream_I just started using this...as advised on the [...] skin consult...and love it!  Amazon has about the best price I've found, as well.  Works great with the starter kit that comes with the products in this line all in one great kit for a great price savings (eye serum, tinted face moisturizer with sunscreen and cleanser).  I use the products in the kit during the day and the cleanser and night cream at night."
7720,"nice product_I really like this mascara. It does a nice job of thickening my lashes. The price was great, and the shipping was fast. Thank you."
4193,"Pleasantly surprised_I have to say I was quite skeptical- stuff like this is usually such a scam, but because I was in no way willing to risk or pay for Latisse or any other expensive name brand lash treatments, I went this route.I've been using for about 1 1/2 months now and I do see results. I apply it only at night after washing off makeup. My lashes have definately gotten stronger and shiny, and seem a little bit darker. The length has increased slightly- thickness not so much, but I will continue to hope for further progress. I can't get away without an eyelash curler because nature gave me naturally straight lashes, but i can tell a different with and without mascara on.. and lashes seem to hold a curl better/longer.I'm happy!"
8490,"Great for holding messy styles_I picked this up for my husband, whose go-to product for the last ten years has been Jonathan Dirt.  Although he prefers the Dirt since it's what he's used to, he has also been using this a lot, and really likes it.A small dab of this is all you need if you have shorter hair, and it holds until your next shampoo.  It also washes off your fingers really easily, with no messy residue left behind.The small also dissipates pretty quickly, and, after about five minutes, I can't even smell it on him.It's a great product for this price range, and definitely gives higher-end products a run for their money."
3630,Silky hair !!!_I have dry relaxed hair and this product mixed with the kanechom Ceramides is wonderful ! This makes my hair silky and bouncy and very moisturized. The smell does not bother me at all! This will forever be one of my staples !
136,"not for sensitive skin_Color looked orange, smelled funny, but worst part was it stung and irritated my sensitive skin. I would not purchase if you have sensitive skin."
2749,hurts my eyes_I have been intermittently using this because it irritates my eyes. My friend who recommended this just said that I just need to make sure it doesn't get into my eyes. That's what I have been doing! I stopped for a few days then tried using it again. It still hurts! I ended up buying fake lashes now hahaha. got effing tired of this. I've also tried rapidlash too and it just causes redness on wherever I applied it. Hope my fake lash glue won't do the same thing. I'm such a loser.
908,5-7 day_I Like this product really well.  My nails now have a nice healthy sheen to them. I did not notice if they were growing any faster but they are definitely growing healthier.
9045,Bristles aren&#8217;t long enough_The bristles are so short that it doesn't actually brush your hair.  My daughter&#8217;s hair is thin and still this brush doesn't work.  I can&#8217;t see how this removes any tangles.  If anything I believe it actually caused more of them.
5520,"Best facial wash cloths ever!_Like others have mentioned, you only need water to completely remove all but the most stubborn eye makeup."
6701,"Perfect co-wash for naturally kinky curly girls!_I read the reviews and got this over the weekend. Yep...this is definitely a keeper. I used about a palm and a half for my whole head (natural kinky 3c/4a hair, just past shoulders) and I loved it. First, the scent is heavenly (but it doesn't linger too much) and it really detangled my hair nicely. The slip was excellent; I didn't even really need a comb, just my fingers. I left it in for about 10 minutes and then rinsed it all out. My hair was clean (not squeaky so it didn't completely dry it out - which I hate), soft and shiny. I used a diffuser on medium heat for about 5 - 7 minutes, added coconut oil to the ends, detangled again briefly with a Denman Brush and braided for the night. I woke up to beautiful defined curls and no frizz. Will definitely buy this again. Great deal for the money since I'm sure I could have used less."
7185,"sweet dreams_I use this nightly.  While I can't say with any certainty that I can see any differences in my skin, I think my skin looks great and I like how rich and creamy it is.  I don't typically like fragrances, but this one is nice and dissipates quickly."
2165,Shipped pretty fast and in tact_The product really works...and de-tangles my flowing hair. It is awesome if you're going swimming too or you're in Humid Florida
6658,"Love it_Great smell, leaves skin soft and great price!  Also lathers well. Will definitely buy again!....this product line never let's me down."
4396,LOVE_This is hands down my favorite oil. It makes my hair thicker and aids in growth. I recommend to all natural girls!
3095,"I don't use this_This is my daughter's favorite.  I am having to order 3-4 at a time (keeping in mind exp. dates) because I'm worried it will not be available.  She is SO pale and many light tone just don't look good, this one does a good job for her."
5408,AMAZING_got this cause I heard good things about it. the color is so amazing I really love it. I would get it if I were you.
9608,"I love these eye cream!_I received this eye cream courtesy of Tomoson.com for my honest opinion and review. I must say its probably the best eye cream I've ever used. First of all it smells AMAZING and like cucumbers. It's seriously like having a cucumber right on my eyes at the spa without it actually happening. Upon first use I noticed significantly less puffiness from my lack of sleep which is awesome and exactly what I was looking for in an eye cream. A little of this stuff goes a LONG way too, so don't be fooled by the small sized bottle, It goes on super smooth and works GREAT under makeup. Will definitely purchase again!"
4857,"Had my manicure yesterday with my new bottle of Bella's Vampire_This is a deep beautiful color, almost black with purplish reddish undertones. It almost looks like a deep black cherry, just lovely."
2439,"user for years_This has been my go-to moisturizer for about 10 years now. I'm 30 and still love the shimmer this lotion provides along witht the lovely smell and intense moisture. During extreme weather, I also add in 100% pure argan oil to enhance moisture. Works great!"
3001,"Super smooth application_I can't find this product in any of my local stores anymore so I get it here. It glides on and stays put all day, and it doesn't make my eyes water like many others like it."
7056,"Good value for the money_Nice array of brushes for all of your makeup needs.  The leather case is soft, compact and protects the brushes."
9010,"Gorgeous_Love this polish. I know it was intended to be a summer polish, but the yellow hue almost perfectly matches the fall colors of the maple trees around my house. It was opaque in two coats, on day two with no tip wear or chipping."
9490,"eh_I am going to keep it since i could just wear a hat, but really disappointed with the thin-ness in the back :( I love this company, just not this wig so much"
2594,"Cozy_I usually go for citrusy-light fragrances. I bought this as part of a mini-perfume set. I thought the smell was too strong at first, but the other day I tried it and now I love it. I feel warm and cozy when I wear it, and I don't get a headache. It's a very fall/winter scent. Oftentimes I associate scents with a place and time; I wanted to avoid wearing this to work because I didn't want to have that association, but for some reason with this scent I don't. It's just so good! It lasts a long time, and it smells like a million bucks."
324,it cleans_i put this on everyday i feel the clean it smells more like a powder smell not to roseyit helps with my break outs and the shine i get with a greasy face
3150,"Worked for me._I like the way this worked. I think, for me, it actually did lessen my wrinkles. I purchased it just recently for a second time and also am going to try neutrogena facial cream too with this."
2294,"OPI is always great!_This is a really hard product to find.  The nail salons are always out of it because everyone loves it...  I was SO surprised to find it on Amazon - and REALLY happy!  This is the only Ridge Filler that I have ever loved.... of course, you can never go wrong with OPI!"
7356,GREAT BUT..._Well I been using WEN for a month now and I must say WEN is still more moisturizing and leaves hair more shiny than this product. After first use I noticed more friz and flyaways which I never experience with WEN but it is still a good product i would recommend leaving it on much longer than directed tho. i also tried loreal cleansing conditioners and even the smell of this product is better and softer nd not as overpowering as the loreal the loreal does condition mutch better than this product. I rank WEN #1 Loreal #2 and this 3 but i still plan to continue using it for wen is expensive so I would like to use an alternative every other day
6793,"lies_There are not 1800. And when you apply them, they get dull because its plastic. Not shinny at all, even with gel"
3261,"I don't get the rave reviews._This is a major ripoff.  The product you can use is just the point, which is the size of a pea.  You cannot sharpen it, because the case is plastic coated.  It doesn't have a twist up mechanism.  What you see is what you get, maybe enough for two or three uses.  Sorry, but I don't pay this much for two or three uses of anything.  NYX must be high.  One reviewer suggests we depot the product.  Sorry, but homie don't play that.  I shouldn't have to modify a product, just to be able to use it all.  I saw a YouTube video suggesting that freezing the pencil will make it easier to sharpen.  Again, NYX should provide a usable product, not one that is extremely difficult to dispense.  It's a shame, too, because I like the actual product, just not the packaging.  I'll buy another brand that allows me more than just a few uses, one in which there is more than a pea size amount of usable product.  I honestly don't get the rave reviews."
9794,"Got fine hair and not much of it? Read this!_I am reluctant to use new hair products or devices having found that the combination of Kronos shampoo, Fancifull temporary hair color, and a hot brush takes the anguish out of a.m. hair prep.  Nevertheless, age and menopause have added unfortunate waves to thin and fine, so I gave this straightener a try.A little experimentation over a week resulted in a more than satisfactory end result--hot brush first, then, once dry, this tool to further smooth and bend my hair at just the right level to give it some fullness (i.e. no Morticia look).  Those of you with similar hair will appreciate how the disposition of just a few hairs can change your look for better or worse.  In this case, the smooth and bend strategy on the top layer gives the illusion that there's fullness to this head of hair when, in fact, there is not.  Plus it completes the shine that Fancifull begins.I love it!"
1202,"Do You Want Dewy & Radiant skin?_I have never tried Korres before until I saw the reviews of this cream on Amazon. I've been using very expensive Nordstrom brands but felt disappointed with lack of results (they would provide moisturize but wouldn't help much with sun damage or wrinkles). I have been using this Wild Rose cream at night for about 2 weeks now & I can see results. I love how my skin looks / feels dewy and radiant in the morning. Yes, I definitely recommend this multi-tasking cream to those looking for an antiaging, firming & brightening moisturizer!!!"
7849,i really like this_I WANTED TO TRY things from too face but dont want to buy the big ones. it nice i didn't get to try the face primer it was missing but the costmore sirvies was really good but know i know what to get
9539,"Hair feels super clean, and I like the lightly fruity scent_I don't feel like my split ends look any different--but I think I'm just naturally skeptical of those type of claims on beauty products--but this shampoo does make my hair feel wonderfully soft and clean, without any residue, but also without feeling frizzy or flyaway. So for that, high marks.I also really like the scent. It's a very clean, lightly fruity scent that dissipates quickly so you don't  smell like a Jamba Juice, a strip club, or a teenage girl."
8090,"The Banana Boat Sport Coolzone Sunscreen has a nice 'cool' feeling on application ..._When I applied this Banana Boat combination sunscreen and moisturizer it was a bit watery, but wasn't greasy and absorbed nicely.  It wasn't greasy, but left a slightly greasy sheen on my skin.  Unlike some of the old-time sunscreens, I didn't have to spend ten minutes trying to rub it in.  It has a light fragrance, but nothing cloying or overwhelming.  It does feel cool to the skin when I applied it and felt really nice when I did a second application once I'd been outside a while.  There are many sunscreens available, but this one is probably perfect for anyone heading to the beach.  We're all for using it any time we are out in the sun for any length of time.It does have the Skin Cancer Foundation seal of approval right on front of the bottle.  In this house one family member has spent quite a bit of time in a surgeon's office removing skin cancers of all types so we are well aware of the dangers of not using sunscreen.  This one has a broad spectrum Spf of 30, but Banana Boat is also available in Spf 15 and Spf 30.  It has a water resistant factor that allows the user to stay in the water for 80 minutes before needing another application.I like preferred theBanana Boat Protect and Hydrate Sunscreen Lotion Spf 30over this one because of the shea butter and the simple fact that it also acts as a moisturizers.  This, however, is one product that we'll be adding to our 'must have' list during the summer or for when we go on vacation right along with the other Banana Boat.  I did like the 'cool' feeling from this sunscreen.ACTIVE INGREDIENTS:Avobenzone3.0% , Homosalate8.0% , Octocrylene4.0%INACTIVE INGREDIENTS:Water Alcohol Denat., Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Acryloylimethyltaurate/VP Crosspolymer, Acrylates/C12-22 Alkyl Methacrylate Copolymer, Menthyl Lactate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Silica, Citrus Aurantium Sinesis FiberOrange, Triethanolamine, Gellan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Menthol, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, FragranceBANANA BOAT SUNSCREENS:Banana Boat Sport Performance Sunscreen Lotion, Spf 15Banana Boat Sport Performance Sunscreen Lotion, Spf 30Banana Boat Sport Performance Sunscreen Lotion, Spf 50"
5448,"Pretty good product! Worth a try._I have purchased this twice now.  It works pretty well. Has a nice matte finish, stays in place, does not make my mascara run, good price, and does not irritate my eyes!  Does a nice job of hydrating and reducing crow's feet.  Could be a bit better on firming/tightening, but not bad. I'm sure I will buy it again."
5874,Easy to use_The glue works good n I would recommend it to someone else ...N is easy to use ...love it!!!!
8270,"This is good stuff!_I have used this product twice after using a more expensive brand. I am aafrican American with natural hair. I have absolutely no complaints about this product. I have read other bad reviews and am convinced that the users did not do their homework before using henna. ALL henna has the potential to dry out African American hair. This is why you MUST mix it with a deep non-protein conditioner prior to applying it and then use a deep conditioner after rinsing it out big you need instructions on how to use henna properly check out CurlyNikki.com, google or YouTube it. Personally, I use one 50g pack and mix it with 3/4 cup of an all natural green tea mix. (I steep two bags of green tea in 3/4 cup of water). I wait an hour and then add 1/2 cup of generic conditioning balm (purchased at Sally's). I also add 1/4 cup mixture of castor oil and avocado oil.  Mix all of these ingredients and cover for an hour or more. You MUST give the henna mixture time to release the color. Then apply to hair and cover with Saran Wrap for at least two hours. Rinse it out and then deep condition your hair. I guarantee you that you will notice a change in color and softness if you follow these instructions. My hair is graying and this resulted in 100% coverage. My hair looked a little orange after first treatment but turned a beautiful dark brown with red highlights after second treatment a few days later. This is not a process for people who can't devote time and effort to their hair. It is very time consuming . But I think the benefits are worth the fuss."
4106,"Tried and true_Maybelline is a trusted brand . I know its dept. store, but it will live up to your expectations. Remember practice makes perfect. Black is the best. Be dramatic and bold , you will never look old.Shopmaster knows!"
822,"mmmm yes._I bought this for my husband.It smells so good, it is woodsy but not like someone who rubbed themselves down with a pine air freshener. It has an almost spice smell and a soft citrus tone.It is manly and sexy.I do not usually use that word in a review but this cologne has such a sexy masculine smell... I really love it when my husband wear Clinique Happy for men.I would recommend this product, but be ready to smell amazing. :)"
2003,"work well_i have purchased many different brands of  face wipes because I'm frequently too lazy to get up in the evening to wash my face. Especially if I didn't wear any make up that day.  I keep these in a drawer next to the couch in my TV room and use them instead. They work well, and  clean the skin without leaving it dry. Presto! No guilt!"
3333,"Great Makeup but Doesn't seem to cover up blemishes_A couple of people my mom and I knew tried bare minerals and they looked great. It gives a soft focus to your face and it honestly feels lightweight enough that I am not rushing home to wash it off. I've never said that about any other make up. Definitely buy the kit with the extra brushes because you need a minimum of 3 for the foundation, warmth, and mineral veil. The foundation matte did keep my face from being oily without having the caked on look of most foundations. The warmth is a type of blush which in the medium skin tone kit turned out to be a dark rose color - good for winter but not exactly a summery color. The mineral veil does give you that glowing look and if I only could buy one product again it would be this. I am not sure if Bare Minerals has a concealer in their line but if you have any blemishes, zits, or age spots then it still shows through the makeup."
3331,"This stuff is PERFECT_My skin is the awful combination of oily and dry, so I was skeptical when my dermatologist recommended this as the cure. But two years later, I'm addicted. I wash my face with this daily and have seen a great improvement to the skin tone and blemish reductions. Very rarely do I see a pimple or blackhead - my skin is clear. When my hand eczema got bad this summer, another dermatologist recommended this non-lathering cleanser to wash my hands.Stocked up on a few bottles from Amazon and I'm all set! Recommend this product to my friends & family."
2664,Blow dryer is good_The blow dryer itself is good but I am not sure I would use the conditioner part again. I don't care for the smell and I don't feel it did much for my hair. The dryer itself works very well and has enough power with 3 heat settings and 2 speed settings. I would recommend the dryer just not the conditioner add on.
400,"Lost a customer_I had been using Clairol Natural Instincts Midnight Black for a long time.  I loved the original formula.  The color was excellent and the conditioner was the best (wish I could have bought it separate it was so good).  I bought the new 10 min formula to cover my gray with Black and my roots are brown!  It is too ugly.  I now have Brown roots and the rest of my hair is black.  I don't like it at all.  I don't understand why the formula changed.  Why won't Clairol tell us the reason? Was the original formula hazardous to our health?  If so, does this mean the new formula is even worse?  The 10 min formula is deceptive.  It does not color my hair the color I expect.  I will not use this formula ever again.  As a matter of fact I think I may be afraid to use even the original formula if I ever find it again.  So long Clairol and thanks for nothing."
6236,Ruby_This is a long lasting lip liner. It goes on smooth and lasts all day. I usually wear it under my NYX sparkling orange lipstick to create bright redish orange lips.
1597,"A thorough clean for sensitive skin._I will start off my review by noting that I have very sensitive, yet oily and acne-prone skin. Because of this odd combination, it is difficult for me to find compatable skin care products which do a good job of cleaning without irritating my skin. When do I find an item that works with my skin, I stick with it because my skin is hard to shop for!That said, I have been using this product for years. My face feels fresh and clean after use, not itchy or stinging or irritated like it feels after using your average face wash, and I feel more clean than after using most gentle face washes. It also doesn't break me out and the pump seems much more sanitary than squeeze tube packaging and the like. The pumps always seem to stop popping back up after I press them down once I am about halfway through the bottle, but it's just a minor inconvenience to have to press the pump twice to get product out. This face wash is definitely worth it."
9751,"Excellent quality & variety, iffy sizes_Pueen makes my favorite stamping plates because of the fantastic quality and this set is just as good; the images are detailed and crisp, they are just a breeze to work with. This set is unique in that the patterns are all combined so that the entire plate is full of images, so there's a big boost in variety without the limitations of being too 'themed' as I think the MoYou plates are.But I have to drop a star because many of the patterns and images are so big you can't get the effect if you have average to smaller nails, like I do. Almost all the images or patterns with flowers are so big that I can't use them and still be able to tell what the image is once it's on the nail. Conversely, Plate 52 has a bunch of fantastic geometric shapes, but there are so many on the plate, there isn't enough room to get a lift of any of the individual patterns to cover the whole nail, what whatever you can lift is so enlarged you can't see the pattern once it's on the nail anyway.I think the makers of stamping plates are hearing customers complaints and are finally giving us larger images, but they're cheating. Instead of giving more pattern they're just making them bigger, and there is a significant difference. I've seen this same problem with the Cisi & Sisi sets as well)."
1526,Works great for stamping_Works great for stamping. The bottles is small for the price but I would buy again because it works well.
9558,"Nice smelling, matte hair gel with good hold._I've been sampling, buying, and using Axe products for over five years.  It's fun to try out the wide variety of hair gel/cream products from Axe.Likes:*Piney, masculine, fresh scent that my family, friends, and co-workers are accustomed to.*Easy to apply and style my hair.*Matte gel is non-greasy, dries clear/matte. Doesn't leave hair stiff/crunchy, or that shiny/oily look.*Generous 6oz. tube with bottom dispensing cap should last two to three months of daily use.*Messy doesn't mean disheveled; there still has to be some style and flow to a &#34;messy&#34; hairstyle.Slight Dislike:*While the Axe hair gel scent is pleasant and unobnoxious; there's not much variety for an occasional change of olfactory stimulation.Bottom Line:Good hair styling gel that I enjoy using but don't expect pretty women to fall into amorous trances as seen in the funny Axe commercials."
5227,"Protective_Summers are pretty brutal in Michigan but winters are worse.  Usually I can see the damage from the cold and wind on the backs of my hands and then on my face.  No matter how much lotion I put on my face, it seems to absorb it.  This winter, after a few months of using Divine Age Guardian Cr&egrave;me, my hands are getting raspy and wrinkly from the cold, but my face is not.  The directions say to use this twice a day but I have been getting by with using it once, in the morning, over the Divine Age Guardian Serum.For me, the issue isn&#8217;t so much younger looking skin, but healthy skin.  I love the feeling of good, clean, moisturized skin and how soft it feels, from the inside and the outside.  After almost 30 years of using Clinique, I began to feel like the moisturizers were pretty similar in results, even though they seemed to be becoming even more Advanced and Extra everything.  Their costs also seemed to be going up exponentially for smaller and smaller containers.I remember the beautiful bottles and jars my mom had on her dresser when I was little.  They were always just a little out of reach and a little too fragile for a child&#8217;s hands.  They were looked pretty and they were small and smelled like clean linen.  These bottles are so pretty and of such a nice color that they remind me of the bottles that were always out of reach.This product was provided to me for review purposes."
1804,"Best Eyelash Curler_I find this to be a wonderful eyelash curler, one of the best. It doesn't crimp your eyelashes, just gives your eyelashes a nice smooth curve to it."
7728,"Too Much Trouble._The serum itself is fine but it is pricier than the one sold by Watts. Also, the dropper did not touch the bottom so you have to stop using the dropper to be able to use all of the product. Not satisfied with this purchase."
6052,"Not working_Tried it twice as directed and it doesn't remove any dead skin. I thought it is like a body scrub (as described), but it is not. It might be good for in-grown hair on hands and legs (not thicker hairs) only. Waste of money for me."
6918,Yummy!_Not only does this smell yummy it works on keeping the flakes away. My hair tends to be on the dry side but this actually has enough conditioner in it to help it.
5871,"Use it everytime I unload the dishwasher!_I have never heard of these things and figured I might be cluttering my kitchen with more items I did not need. I recently moved into a much bigger house and whenever I unload the dishwasher there are a lot of item with water on them. I used to place a lot of paper towels on the counter, place the wet items on the paper towels, then reuse the paper towels once dried. It was a ritual I became used to.When I received this mat it was folded up. I decided to wash it because if I am placing clean dishes on it, I want to make sure it is clean. I also dried it in the dryer and it looks perfect! It did still have the marks from where it was folded and easily folded back up which was handy because I placed it in a drawer near the dishwasher folded.I have placed it on the counter over the dishwasher when I unload it and place the wet items on it. I then let them air dry and put them away. The mat then dries and I fold it up and place it back in the drawer for the next use. I think I will wash it about once a month. Since I am placing clean dishes on it and it is dry when placed away, there is no need to wash it a lot.I love this thing and did not think I would use it as much as I have. It also comes in handy if you have a lot of dishes that are hand wash only and your in sink dish holder is too small like mine. I just place the extra items on the mat and let them air dry.I have not had an issue with water soaking through. If you need extra room for dishes or want to save paper towels, this thing is for you!"
6935,"Great Place to Start_This is an awesome buy for those who want to start stamping.  The plate comes attached to a hard plastic backing and is very easy to manipulate.  I like having all the images on one plate and I especially like having the French curve at the bottom of each image.The etchings are not as fine or detailed as any Konad or some of the Bundle Monster plates, but they get the job done very nicely.  I've found that using stamping polish with these can be overpowering since the designs are a little &#34;busy&#34;, so I stamp with a heavily pigmented drug store brand (or whatever is on deep discount).  I've not had any trouble getting the polish to transfer so long as the plate and stamper are clean, the nail is oil-free, and the image is sliiiightly tacky before application.  Speaking of, since the detailing is wider within the image, stamping with wet polish will blur the image.  Apply the polish, scrape the excess, pick up the image, blow on it for 1-2 seconds, and then roll it onto your clean nail with medium and even pressure.  Voila!The plate is easy to clean and I don't have a problem keeping polish confined to the area with which I am working.This was my first set of images and I am still very happy with the purchase.Now, it does come from China, so expect a wait for delivery."
6274,So Soft_I've used this soap for years and I love how my skin feels.  I like the unscented cause I prefer less fragrance in my life.Highly recommend this!
9746,"Good product_This is a &#34;leave-in&#34; product.It's not a mouse or gel.  It comes out of the pump as a foam (think soap).  The &#34;seaweed and lotus blossom&#34; is a pleasant fragrance (for me).This product dries quickly and does not leave a sticky or greasy feel when dry.While it is not designed to be used for styling, there is some &#34;hold&#34; that can be useful.There is a serious difference between my hair with and without this product.  The volume it achieves (especially with a volumizing shampoo) is impressive.So for those of you who remember the days of &#34;spray on hair&#34; this is way better (if you still have hair).Highly recommended."
2198,"Smells like trees_I like balsamic scents (Peru balsam is also nice), so of course I like this. Mixes well with other wood oils (cedar, sandalwood) as well as sharper green scents (rosemary, lavender)."
5514,"Great shampoo!_I own both Shimmering blue lights and this shampoo. I prefer this shampoo. The smell is great and it works wonderfully. I didn't expect it to, but it lifted the slightly muted brass/orange tones out of my bleached blonde hair wonderfully! I didn't notice at first until after several washes, but it's worked great!Some reviews have said the it drys your hair out.All shampoo's do this people. It washes the hairs natural oils out, thats why we use conditioner after, to put the oils back in.I, myself, didn't notice that my hair was dry as I follow after it with AussieMoist 3 Minute Miracle Deep Conditioner 8 Fl Oz (Pack of 4)."
5628,"Very vibrant, sparkly hot pink color_The name says it all! great flashy, sparkly hot pink color. I love this on my toes and my daughter puts it on her nails every time. I just put this color on top of the IBD mango polish and I love the way it looks. It is brilliant and fun and with the mango color under it, it makes it a great fall color."
3055,"~~~~Does Exactly what it claims to do and does it well~~~~~_I just used this new iron on clean and dry shoulder length fine hair. I used the lowest setting and that worked great. My hair had some static electricity issues and it all got smoothed out. My hair is soft and has much more shine!I straightened it and then flipped the ends with a  quick turn and that also worked great. The rotating cord is a huge plus. Also the floating ceramic plates are great. My last iron stopped coming together flat after about a month. I returned it to the company and got a new one only to have it happen again so I am glad to have this new one that looks like a winner.I have one con that may be just due to the fact I have long fingers but as I use it how I hold it I kept hitting the increase and decrease temperature buttons and need to kept re-adjusting. Over time I should learn to hold it in another fashion. This may or may not be an issue for you but wanted to get everything out on the table so to speak.My hair feels soft and not burnt in any way. It looks and feels great.It is an nice soft blue/aqua color that looks nice in the bathroom, not the ususal brown or black.The 4 year warranty makes it a great value. I highly recommend the product. It is a bit smaller than some other irons which I think makes it much easier to use and store."
3577,"It Works!_Okay, so I bought this a couple of years ago at a drug store.  I tried it, it didn't work so I threw it in a drawer and forgot about it.  Well, lately due to neglect my feet have been so dry and rough.  I tried the whole vaseline and wearing socks overnight thing, but my skin was too tough for that to work.  So, I found the ped egg and decided to give it another try.  I used it like other reviewers advised on dry skin and gently.  Then I finished it off with my foot file (their is lame)and voil&aacute; my feet were good as new!  Okay, almost new, like 90% better.  Now my feet are beautiful and soft again!  It's like that whole year of neglect never happened.  I've been using it pretty much everyday for about a week and my feet just get better and better.  My husband said this is the softest my feet have been in awhile."
9349,"The Best Face Cream in Existence_I purchase products on Amazon almost daily lately and have purchased here for years. Though I should, I hardly ever review what I buy. Even here, I decided that I would use the product for a certain period of time to make sure that my review was completely accurate.Today I will receive my third jar of this face cream and now I know I will be a lifetime customer because Christina Moss has the formula. She figured it out. This is really IT.I have eczema and have had it all my life. I am now 52 and have mature, dry skin with the potential of eczema flare if my skin doesn't like a topical application. It seems I have tried everything always to be let down. I have settled for mediocre or 'good enough' in my pursuit of what I always thought *should* exist but could never find -- until now.My skin LOVES this cream and so will yours. I swear it's like the nectar of the gods for your skin. I keep it in the refrigerator so on top of being the perfect formula and consistency, the cold cream also feels wonderful. My skin drinks it in but stays hydrated WAY longer than with anything else I've tried.Yes, it smells like licorice. I never had a problem with the smell. It goes away quickly anyway but now I equate the smell of licorice with paradise for my skin. I now love the smell because the cream is such a pleasure to apply. The whole experience is just super pleasant. I understand the reason for the anise and think it was a wise choice.At first I thought that $20/Ounce was just way too much and that I would never be able to keep using this because I have very dry skin and probably use more than most people would, but I am going to have to rearrange my finances to figure it out because it is the best cream I have ever used. Even if I used one of these 1 oz jars per week, even $80 for a 4 oz jar of this is not a lot compared to other high end creams (that this one beats hands down anyway).It is worth every penny."
5717,Love it_This is one of my favorite colors. Try it with the yellow additive... it is awesome! Also great by itself.
7751,"Similar but thicker than Olay Regenerist_When I first saw this product, I thought it wasOlay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, 1.7 Ounce. They use very similar designs.I have been using Olay Regenerist for a while and I really love the product. But because they look similar I decided to try L'Oreal Revitalift.L'Oreal Revitalift is quite thicker than Olay Regenerist. That didn't bother me, but some people may not appreciate the feeling. I have been using the product for 3 weeks now, and I don't see any change with my skin. That's actually good. Because Olay Regenerist made a huge difference on my skin when I switched from other products, and my skin felt already pretty good before I started using L'Oreal. However, it didn't give me any reasons to switch to L'Oreal from Olay because I was already happy with Olay's Regenerist.L'Oreal Revitalift and Olay Regenerist are both good product. And they are both the same price. If I have a choice with the same price, I choose Olay Regenerist."
8446,"Two uses, I can see results_I have a slightly dry scalp and occasionally have some flakes.  Not enough to buy Denorex but thought this might make a difference.  I've used it twice this week and can tell my hair feels softer, shiny, and no signs of flakes.  I like the smell as well.  I know it says it 'repairs damage' but feel that no amount of this or anything else can repair split ends.  Routine hair cuts or trims are your only option there.  I'd suggest this if you have dry hair or a dry scalp to see if it helps.  I'm happy."
6199,"My other half._I use this everyday or whenever I feel like it, If something is wrong with my hair it fixes it. I don't know how but it does everything it says it does. Magic."
1486,"get your glow on...._this bronzer imparts a nice, natural glow.....not too orangey....a little sparkle, but not too much.....I'm a pale redhead and this gives me just enough color to knock off my natural fish-belly white glow in the dark complexion.....lol.....I load a fluffy brush and after applying my mineral make-up. I touch this to my forehead, cheek bones, under my chin and a little on my neck......and wahhh laaaa.....I look healthy and vibrant again.......makeup is my friend.  :)"
8655,"Works like it should_This does a great job straightening hair and doesn't get too hot on your hand (which I've experienced before with a hair iron).The unit feels substantial and well-built. Like all appliances the true test is the time, but this is working great after a couple months of use.I was provided with an iron to use and provide an objective review."
6092,"Works Well_I have been trying to phase out most of the chemicals in my family's household and bath products and in a lot of cases the products are more expensive and don't work as well. This shampoo is marginally more expensive than my previous hair color shampoo, but it works just as well and has MUCH less chemicals in it. The shampoo has a nice scent, lathers well and my hair color has not faded any more than with the other hair color shampoos. My only (very small) complaint (and this really goes for all of the 'natural' bath products that I have tried) is that it is a little thin and can slip through your fingers pretty fast."
5078,"these are tiny...but they do work on my thick hair_you will need a cluster of them to pull back any substantial amt of hair, but they do work and i will use them."
8272,Good curling iron for touch-ups!_Andis twist curling iron is a good affordable all purpose hair styling tool that I am glad to have added to my styling aids.  I like the choices of heat that it provides and the 1 inch size is just right for the spiral curls I have been wearing lately.  I am too clutzy to use it for my entire head tho.  I curl my entire head with leave in foam curlers for the night.  By the morning there are always some pieces that have escaped the curlers and this is where I find the iron useful to provide those touch-ups.  I try to avoid heat on my hair as it is very long and fine and I want to prevent breakage.  That being said I havent noticed any heat damage from this iron and it leave the ringlets shiny and bouncy.
9513,"Tropical scent?? - holds quite well_This is a kids product, but since I enjoy many of the smells marketed for children, I had to give this a try. The coconut is not overpowering, but has an undertone of something else, making it not as pleasant as I would have expected. The spray itself is nice and creates a fine mist. Since this is a light hold, I wasn't expecting much, but ended up finding that I could get away with just this spray when layered a second time. The hold was very satisfactory - even with my very fine hair. It didn't leave my hair stiff and held the style as well as my normal brand.I like that Suave Kids Hairspray is alcohol free and has a decent hold, but I just am not sold on the scent, even though I love tropical and coconut fragrances."
500,"LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!_I absolutely love this brush!!! It works perfectly for back combing, and creating 'the bump' or volume in your hair, even if it is fine like mine! Would definatly recommend!!"
6290,"Great stuff_Just recently started using ROC products, I use this about twice a week along with all the other ROC Resurfacing Products, it helps exfoliate your skin"
6307,"Keeps hair under control, but a bit drying_This leave in conditioner smells delicious, almost like a pina colada. It does a good job at keeping my dry poofy hair under control, but I find that it leaves my hair a bit dried out. Nothing too horrible, but I am still looking for that perfect leave-in and this is not it."
3348,"BUY IT_Best stuff ever. Creates a smooth and shiny blowout with great movement. Highly recommend.  Try Oribe's gentle shampoo, too! Amazing stuff."
8895,"A New You in 30 Minutes - Color with a Wow Factor_I've been using Garnier hair products for quite a few years now and I must say this Olia oil powered haircolor is the best I've ever used. There is no dripping and the creamy coloring mixture applies like a dream. All you do is mix the developer and colorant together and then apply it with a cute little teardrop bottle. I found it easy to use. The only thing I had a problem with was the gloves. I had to use my own gloves as the gloves in this kit are a bit small.One of the fun aspects of this coloring process is the lovely floral scent of the coloring mixture and conditioner. If you are used to products with ammonia in them you may be very surprised at how pleasant this coloring experience is.The results are stunning really. This permanent color will make your hair gorgeous and has a wow factor. Once dry your hair will feel great and be super shiny. My hair now seems to have more volume and a playful bounce. This gave me full gray coverage and the color was a deep rich shade of brown without any red in it. This seems to be more of a golden brown and is very natural looking.The only warning I have to issue is that this product may produce a slight irritation on the scalp. For me it was a very mild reaction and I'm not too worried about it.Also, the directions for using this coloring product are the best I've seen from Garnier. They really thought this through and give directions for a touch-up application which takes 30 minutes and an all-over application which takes 30 minutes.If you are wondering about how much hair this coloring cream will work on I'd say there is enough for shoulder length hair or hair that is two inches beyond the shoulder. I have fairly long hair at the moment and there was plenty of coloring mixture.I will definitely use this again as I loved the results.~The Rebecca Review"
7523,"Harmony Gelish Champagne_Elegant and incredible!!! I use it as an accent color to offset a plain base to add some sparkle. It is a clear, elegant and very small heavily packed sparkle coat. Love it, and happy to have it in a .5cc bottle not the .25 which is all I can get at the store near my home."
3762,"Awesome!_The colors look awesome! I was worried that it would show up broken due to the warning I received before I placed the order for this product, however i took a chance and it came perfectly in tact. The colors are splendid and my friend loved it! I would recommend this to anyone who loves warm colors."
2150,"Non-Greasy Coverage_(this review is for the SPF 100)I've read some complaints that this looks white-ish on skin or that it dries powdery, but I personally didn't experience any of that--and I have medium-dark skin.My skin tone is actually part of the reason I went for this UVA/UVB cream; as you fellow dark-skinned ladies know, we usually don't burn so much as get hyper-pigmentation or sun spots. My incredible neglect of sun protection (I avoided sunscreen bc they're usually greasy or chalky) and resulting hyper-pigmentation led me to the realization that I should probably wear SPF on a daily basis. I figured a high SPF, UVA/UVB non-greasy sunscreen would be perfect--and so far it is!The formula is very thick, but not at all greasy. I apply little dabs all over my face, and rub them in from there (as opposed to squirting a bunch directly in my hands, since it's thick and dries quickly). I'm weaning myself off of wearing foundation, so I can't say how it reacts with makeup. However, because it dries quickly and isn't greasy, I would recommend wearing this under face makeup. I would make a pros/con chart, but I haven't come across any cons yet.I should also mention that this is one of the few cheap drugstore sunscreens that doesn't contain any parabens--not that I personally care, but if you're specifically looking for a non-paraben sunscreen, that's even more reason to get this.As for buying it on Amazon, I got mine here for less than 9 bucks, but when I went to the local drugstore they had it for 13."
8893,"Disappointing_First, I will say that I absolutely loved the color result of this product. It was the perfect dark brown.  I got so many compliments on it. Also, I am a veteran home hair color consumer.Now . . . Something is not right with this product.  It may be ammonia-free, but there is a chemical equally harsh, possibly more so in it. There really is no bad smell, but it most certainly had fumes. Fumes that stung both my eyes and throat. That was mysteriously disturbing.  Then, when I washed the color out, my hair felt like wires.  My first thought was, to quote Gob Bluth, 'I've made a huge mistake.' Then I conditioned it, thinking that would take care of the wiry feel. At best, it upgraded the feel from wires to straw.  ??? So I was quite disappointed in this product.  I just touched up my gray roots with Clairol's Natural Instincts and, while I have used this product numerous times in the past, I could not get over the difference in the feel of my hair after merely rinsing the color out. Very smooth, no wires. Post-conditioner? Super slick and smooth. I realize that Natural Instincts is semi-permanent, but it also touts the ammonia-free label. I DO NOT recommend Olia. If you do a Google search on it, you will find at least one forum where women have had their hair come out in clumps, or they've not been able to get it rinsed out after days and days of washing and rinsing, and other such horrors. It's not worth the cost or the risk, so BUYER BEWARE."
1342,WORKS GREAT_I WAS ACTUALLY REALLY SURPISED AT HOW MUCH THESE WILL STRETCH WITH OUT BREAKING. IT WAS ALSO NICE TO SEE HOW WELL THEY COME OUT OF THE BRAID (I USE THE END OF A COMB AND SLIDE IT OFF THE HAIR) AND THEN UNTANGLE IT TO USE IT AGAIN. WILL DEF BUY AGAIN THANK YOU
8526,"Shiny bouncy hair_Oh for the hair of my youth, a full head of shiny bouncy hair! The Nexxus Youth Renewal made me feel young again. My hair responded really well to the shampoo. It lathered well and rinsed easily. As with other Nexsus shampoos I don't care for the bottle design. The thicker bottom is hard to squeeze with wet hands and I get to much out. Otherwise the shampoo had a nice light scent and rinsed easily, leaving my hair looking really nice and easy to style."
3339,"Surprised me_I'd read that it sometimes takes this stuff weeks to work, so that's what I was prepared for:  to wait weeks before seeing anything really noticeably different about my eyelashes.  And that is not how it went down for me at all.I have red hair (not Weasley red, more like Isla Fisher red), so my eyelashes aren't very obvious without mascara.  Almost immediately after the first use of this product, I noticed that my eyelashes stopped falling out.  It was encouraging, but it wasn't exactly unexpected. Tonight though (literally ten minutes ago), after I washed my face, I was in front of the mirror getting really annoyed because my eyeliner wasn't coming off, and the directions say to put this stuff on bare skin.  I mean, I was standing there with lotion and q-tips, completely frustrated, when I looked in the mirror and realized my eyeliner *had* come off, and what I was seeing was a significantly darker lash line.  It floored me; I hadn't expected to see results for at least a month.At this point, I can't say it's making my lashes longer, but I haven't been using it for long.  I *can* say that now, without the aid of mascara or eyeliner, my eyes look like I've got a natural cat's eye lash line.  Don't get me wrong - it's not super smokey and sultry, like I've spent minutes getting it just right.  But it is there, it is noticeable, and it does make a difference.  All of that, and I've been using it for maybe two weeks."
4628,"Eyelash inhancer - not bad for non-prescription_I've been using the Envyderm eyelash enhancer for almost 4 weeks.  The product promises longer, fuller, lusher lashes in 6 weeks.  I certainly do not have long, full or lush lashes in 4 weeks, and I doubt that I will have them with 2 more weeks of use, or even 2 more years of use.  However, I gave this product a 4 star rating because I believe that I am seeing some improvement in my lashes, just not what the product advertises.  I've been using a product called 'Revitalash, also an OTC product, for the past 2 years.  I wasn't real impressed with that product, as it did not live up to its claims, either.  But, when I stopped using Revitalash, I saw a decrease in the fullness and length of my eyelashes, and realized that the product must have been helping.  I switched to Envyderm a month ago, and see no difference between the two products.  The Envyderm seems to work as well as probably any of the non-prescription eyelash growth serums.  I plan to keep using it, and would recommend Envyderm to anyone who is unhappy with her (his) eyelashes, and who does not want to go the prescription route.  I would caution that Envyderm is not a lash 'miracle,' but it does to seem to help, and I'm happy with any help I can get!!"
9759,Polish Racks_They are great. I ordered two. The only problem is one if them has the bottom hooks upside down so I couldn't hang it for support by those. But it does for my polishes.
1819,eyebrow magic_product lived up to its claim my eyebrows lasted for 2 days without any erasing or smudging what a cool product.  i can take my time now deciding whether or not i would want to schedule a permanent makeup brow tattoo. the service was fast and packed nicely. i will order a second bottle this week. this is a must have and a staple.
8011,Unusal and Unique_Look at these Clear Cosmetic Cases! How cute and you can see thru it to make sure you have everything inside instead of having to open the case which is a neat approch. This is a great way to make you keep your make up organized or you will feel embarrassed i know i would.
